We aimed to summarize the evidence on the performance metrics of GAI in the SR process. Methods PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and ProQuest Dissertations \& Theses Global were searched from their inception up to March 2025. Only experimental studies that compared GAI with other GAIs or human reviewers at any stage of the SR were included. Modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2 was used to assess the quality of the studies that used GAI in the study selection process. We summarized the findings of the included studies using a narrative approach. Results Out of 7418 records screened, 30 studies were included. These studies used GAI tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Microsoft Bing AI. GAI appears to be effective for participant, intervention, comparator, and outcome formulation and data extraction processes, including complex information. However, because of inconsistent reliability, GAI is not recommended for literature search and study selection as it may retrieve nonrelevant articles and yield inconsistent results. There was mixed evidence on whether GAI can be used for risk of bias assessment. Studies using GAI for study selection were generally of high quality based on the modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2. Conclusions GAI shows promising support in participant, intervention, comparator, and outcome-based question formulation and data extraction. Although it holds potential to enhance the SR process in healthcare, further practical application and validated evidence are needed before it can be fully integrated into standard workflows."

Three studies were conducted to examine how GenAI is used in hospitality management and test the conceptual model: a three-wave questionnaire survey (N = 333), a quasi-field experiment (N = 227), and an in-depth interview (N = 11). The results indicate that GenAI dependence promotes service innovation by decreasing affective rumination, and this beneficial indirect path is amplified by employees’ neuroticism. Meanwhile, GenAI dependence inhibits service innovation by decreasing problem-solving pondering, and this unfavourable indirect path is weakened by employees’ conscientiousness.

However, the relatively low translation efficiency of exogenous mRNA often limits its wide application. Here, we propose a computational framework called UTailoR (UTR tailor), which significantly improves the challenge by optimizing 5' UTR sequences based on a two-step artificial intelligence strategy. We first develop a deep-learning-based discriminative model for predicting mRNA translation efficiency with 5' UTR sequences, and then present a generative model to generate optimized 5' UTR sequences, which are designed to be highly close to the original sequences but predicted to result in high translation efficiency. The experimental results show that the UTailoR-optimized sequences outstrip the corresponding original sequences by ∼ 200\%. This work provides an efficient and convenient method for the mRNA 5' UTR optimization, which can be easily accessed at http://www.cuilab.cn/utailor."

This mixed-methods exploratory study investigated how Chinese EAL students perceived and used GenAI, and how these attitudes and behaviors reflected their Critical Language Awareness (CLA). Survey data were collected from 320 Chinese undergraduate and graduate students studying in China and abroad, supplemented by in-depth semi-structured interviews with five volunteers. Quantitative findings revealed that, while participants valued GenAI for reducing language barriers and enhancing writing mechanics, they remained wary of issues related to originality, transparency, and ethical accountability. Qualitative analysis further illuminated participants' emerging CLA, evident in their negotiations of power (managing overreliance and misinformation), ideology (navigating dominant academic norms), and social justice (acknowledging cultural biases encoded in GenAI training data). Although students were primarily motivated by pragmatic benefits, such as improved grammar, structure, and efficiency, they also recognized GenAI's potential to perpetuate monolingual, Western-centric perspectives. These results underscore the need to embed CLA principles in GenAI-assisted pedagogy. By encouraging students to critically interrogate GenAI outputs, question linguistic hierarchies, and reflect on sociocultural contexts, educators can better leverage GenAI's affordances while fostering ethical, culturally responsive, and equitable writing practices."

Gastroenterology and hepatology in particular will be transformed due to the multimodal workflows that integrate endoscopic video, radiologic imaging, tabular data, and unstructured note text. GenAI will impact the entire spectrum of clinical experience, from administrative tasks, diagnostic guidance, and treatment recommendations. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, genAI is more flexible, with one platform able to be used across multiple tasks. Initial evidence suggests benefits in lower-level administrative tasks, such as clinical documentation, medical billing, and scheduling; and information tasks, such as patient education and summarization of the medical literature. No evidence exists for genAI solutions for more complex tasks relevant to clinical care, such as clinical reasoning for diagnostic and treatment decisions that may affect patient outcomes. Challenges of output reliability, data privacy, and useful integration remain; potential solutions include robust validation, regulatory oversight, and "human–AI teaming" strategies to ensure safe, effective deployment. We remain optimistic in the potential of genAI to augment clinical expertise due to the adaptability of genAI to handle multiple data modalities to obtain and focus relevant information flows and the human-friendly interfaces that facilitate ease of use. We believe that the potential of genAI for dynamic human-algorithmic interactions may allow for a degree of clinician-directed customization to enhance human presence.}

The China Nurses Network conducted a three-day training session on “GAI for Nursing Research” theme, we selected 23 nurses by a convenience sampling method among participating in the training. The researchers conducted three focus group interviews at the end of each day. All focus groups were interviewed face-to-face to facilitate interaction, data collection, and observation. The data were analyzed using conventional content analysis and coded manually. Results The results showed that nurses’ use of GAI to support scientific research was dynamic and characterized by evolving perceptions and practices. Four themes and 11 sub-themes emerged from the analysis: 1) utilization efficacy: cope with research ability, affected by many factors; 2) booster research: growth and challenges go hand in hand; 3) role reversal: from GAI-dominated to nurse-dominated; 4) beautiful dream: more features on research, more assistants on clinical care. Conclusions The effectiveness of GAI in supporting clinical nurses in conducting research is mainly limited by differences in personal research literacy, lack of ethical regulation, and information accuracy.

However, the complex multi-physics reactions within batteries make traditional mathematical models inadequate for comprehensively revealing their mechanisms. The key to solving this problem lies in introducing data-driven approaches, which have laid a solid foundation for battery research and development through extensive accumulation of experimental data and extraction of effective information. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), leveraging its powerful latent pattern learning and data generation capabilities, has already found widespread applications in protein structure prediction, material inverse design, and data augmentation, demonstrating its broad application prospects. Applying GAI to battery research workflows with diverse battery data resources could provide innovative solutions to challenges in battery research. In this perspective, we introduce the core principles and latest advancements of generative models (GMs), including Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), and Diffusion Model (DM), which can learn the latent distribution of the input samples to generate new data by sampling from it. Applications of GAI in battery research are then reviewed. For battery materials design, by learning material compositions, structures, and properties, GM can generate novel candidate materials with desired properties through conditional constraints, significantly extending the chemical space to be explored. For electrode microstructure characterization, GM can serve as a bridge for interconversion and integration of different image data, enhance the quality of microscopic characterization, and generate realistic synthetic data. For battery state estimation, GM can perform data augmentation and feature extraction on battery datasets, which benefits the model performance for battery state estimation. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future development directions in terms of data governance and model design, including data quality and diversity, data standardization and sharing, usability of synthetic data, interpretability of GM, and foundational models for battery research. For the innovation and advancement of battery technology, this perspective offers theoretical references and practical guidelines for implementing GAI as an effective tool in battery research workflows by discussing its status and prospects in this field."

Background Recently, GenAI-assisted teaching has been widely recognised as a trend in nursing education reform. HOTS and AI literacy are important for nursing students in the era of artificial intelligence. However, studies on the use of GenAI to enhance the HOTS and AI literacy of undergraduate nursing students are limited. Design A quasi-experimental study. Methods Based on OBE theory, interactive teaching strategies using GenAI were introduced into a nursing course. Overall, 132 third-year nursing undergraduates enrolled in this course were randomly divided into experimental (n = 66) and control groups (n = 66). Results After completing the course, the HOTS scores of nursing undergraduates (P = 0.018) and AI literacy (P < 0.001) in the experimental group were significantly better than those in the control group. There was a significant difference in the HOTS scores (P < 0.001) and AI literacy (P < 0.001) between the experimental group before and after the course. Conclusion GenAI-assisted teaching could help nursing undergraduates improve their HOTS and AI literacy. As an important auxiliary teaching tool, GenAI should be integrated into other nursing courses and widely applied in nursing education in the future."

This study seeks to fill this gap by drawing on information behavior literature to explore the effect of GenAI across the entrepreneurial spectrum. By leveraging large language models and prompt engineering patterns, we examined how GenAI could generate accurate, relevant, and inspiring content through various interaction scenarios. Our findings suggest that GenAI significantly mitigates early-stage entrepreneurial information asymmetry and supports sophisticated problem-solving when coupled with appropriate domain knowledge and prompt engineering techniques. However, GenAI’s task complexity limits its use in late-stage entrepreneurial exploitation activities. Finally, this study provides insight into research avenues and practical applications."

However, inconsistent product quality complicates user decisions, jeopardizing both the sustainability of GAI technologies and their broader adoption. To address these challenges, this study proposes a user-centered evaluation framework that integrates fuzzy social networks with advanced multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) approaches. Grounded theory is first employed to establish a ''marketing-information-product-individual'' system of factors influencing GAI product adoption. Next, fuzzy social networks reduce semantic ambiguity and mitigate expert bias, while the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method uncovers causal relationships among these factors. The DEMATEL-based Analytic Network Process (DANP) then quantifies the relative importance of each factor, followed by a modified VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method to comprehensively evaluate representative GAI products. The findings reveal that product maturity exerts the strongest driving force, whereas perceived effect experiences the highest overall impact. Information reliability and the individual dimension carry the greatest weights. Moreover, current products display notable deficiencies in risk management, user service, and ease of use, all of which warrant developers' attention to enhance user satisfaction and adoption. In light of these results, the study proposes targeted optimization strategies for four distinct GAI products. By integrating fuzzy social networks and MADM methodologies, this framework offers a rigorous, systematic evaluation tool that significantly improves decision-making accuracy and promotes the sustainable development of GAI applications."

Methods A structured questionnaire consisting of 56 items across six domains was administered, covering demographics, general and TKM-specific GenAI use, satisfaction, educational experiences, and future expectations. Descriptive statistics, univariable analysis, multivariable logistic regression, and correlation analysis were performed. Results A total of 234 students across six academic years participated in the survey. Most respondents were aware of GenAI (88.5 \%) and used it for general purposes (79.9 \%). However, only 16.2 \% actively used it for TKM learning. While 70.4 \% were satisfied with using GenAI in general, only 45.8 \% felt satisfied with its use for TKM education. Factors significantly associated with GenAI use or satisfaction included enrollment in the TKM curriculum, older age, prior major, scholarship receipt, and self-directed GenAI learning. Although only 18.8 \% had experienced GenAI in formal TKM courses, 96.2 \% viewed GenAI as necessary in TKM education. Conclusion A notable gap exists between students’ interest and the limited integration of GenAI in TKM curricula. To close this gap, GenAI should be systematically incorporated into educational programs, accompanied by faculty training and institutional support to enhance students’ digital readiness and learning outcomes."

    abstract = "While generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is increasingly used to create content, it is often criticized for collecting and training private data and induces potential copy infringement issue. This dilemma leaves a question of whether GAI increases or decreases creators' work sharing. Drawn on protection motivation theory, this study examines how the launch of a GAI system affects creators' contributions on an original work sharing platform. We discover that GAI poses a threat to drawing-category creators, leading to a significant crowding-out effect on their contributions. Specifically, compared with that of non-drawing-category creators, the work sharing of drawing-category creators decreases by 19.64 \% and 14.29 \% within a short period after the launch and removal of the GAI system, respectively. We discover that creators' protective behavior is driven by GAI-related copyright infringement. Compared with creators without copyright protection, those with copyright protection are more inclined to cease contributions or even leave the platform. We further find that among copyright-protected creators, top creators, evidenced by their acquisition of a large number of supporters or platform honor titles, exhibit more pronounced responses to protect their works due to their higher coping efficacy. Notably, this threat reduces creators' sharing behavior or even lead to their exit from the platform. Nevertheless, such reduction is likely to gradually recover once the threat subsides. Overall, our findings have important implications for whether and how platform managers adopt GAI systems, especially in an original work sharing context."

As the first surgical applications of generative artificial intelligence are applied, this perspective paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current applications and future perspectives for the application of generative artificial intelligence in surgery, from preoperative planning to training. Generative artificial intelligence can be used before surgery for planning and decision support by extracting patient information and providing patients with information and simulation regarding the procedure. Intraoperatively, generative artificial intelligence can document data that is normally not captured as intraoperative adverse events or provide information to help decision-making. Postoperatively, GAIs can help with patient discharge and follow-up. The ability to provide real-time feedback and store it for later review is an important capability of GAIs. GAI applications are emerging as highly specialized, task-specific tools for tasks such as data extraction, synthesis, presentation, and communication within the realm of surgery. GAIs have the potential to play a pivotal role in facilitating interaction between surgeons and artificial intelligence."

    abstract = "In telecommunication technology, identifying standard-essential patents (SEPs) plays a crucial role in the management of intellectual property. This technology is regulated by technical standards that are largely based on the content of SEPs. These patents are declared standard-essential by their owners because they contain elements of a technical standard. The declaration process leaves room for over- and under-declaration, which entails risks for organizations. This paper focuses on the question of how generative artificial intelligence can be used to assess the standard-essentiality of 5G technology patents. For this purpose, the standard-essentiality is assessed using different prompts with four Large Language Models (LLMs) in two variants. In the first variant, the LLM results are generated by a rather simple prompt and compared with an approach based on unsupervised and supervised machine learning. The result shows that large LLMs are capable of assessing the standard-essentiality. In the second variant, the best-performing LLM is selected and the prompt is expanded to include selected parts of a technical standard. While the assessment results remain largely the same, the LLM is now able to explain in which detail a patent is part of a standard. This has several implications for patent evaluation, licensing and litigation strategies."

The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence technology has provided the conditions for researchers to transition from sequential organization of bibliographic references to the deconstruction and reorganization of knowledge elements. This study, reveals the intrinsic relationship patterns between multi-granularity knowledge in ancient texts from perspectives such as logical relationships, frame semantic associations, hierarchical structures, and feature associations, and constructs a multidimensional knowledge representation model for ancient texts. Furthermore, a YAML prompt template was designed by integrating large language models with the deconstruction of multi-granularity knowledge elements from ancient texts, and experiments were conducted using the Chinese classic “Records of the Grand Historian: Biographies.” The results indicate that the method developed in this study for the deconstruction and reorganization of knowledge elements in ancient texts exhibits notable characteristics such as multi-granularity, cross-document application, refinement, multiple perspectives, efficiency improvement, and scalability, demonstrating potential for application in the field of knowledge services for ancient texts."

This study aimed to analyse the quality of advice on first aid for seizures generated by a commercially developed chatbot in comparison with its customised version. Methods The baseline version of ChatGPT (model GPT-4o) and the same chatbot customised using a specialised knowledge base and prompt engineering were tested in four scenarios mimicking bystander requests for instructions on how to help a victim with seizures. The scenarios included ongoing seizures and postictal states, with or without consciousness and breathing. A checklist-based evaluation was conducted. Results In total, 120 user-to-chatbot dialogues were generated (2 chatbots × 15 dialogues × 4 scenarios). The baseline chatbot always failed to consider the victim’s state, including whether the seizures are continuing, or if the victim in the postictal period is conscious and breathing normally. Its advice was non-selective and inaccurate, with frequent omissions of key recommendations on first aid and suggestions of inadequate measures. The customised chatbot-generated guidance was consistently tailored to the victim’s condition, significantly more precise and completely safe. Depending on the scenario, the mean percentage of chatbot responses that fulfilled the checklist items was 14–49 \% for the baseline chatbot and 77–92 \% for the customised version (p ≤ 0.039). Conclusions Whereas the publicly available version of the chatbot is not acceptable for first aid counselling, its expert-informed customisation ensures high accuracy and safety of generated advice. Further research in this field is advisable."

Improving the efficiency of aircraft conceptual design while ensuring quality is an important challenge. Intelligent technologies such as neural networks have played significant roles in areas like aerodynamics and structural analysis. However, due to issues such as high data demands and difficulties in transfer learning, their application in the conceptual design phase has been limited. The rise of generative artificial intelligence, exemplified by Large Language Model (LLM), offers a new approach to this problem. Therefore, this study proposes a methodology for generating aircraft conceptual design solutions based on LLMs and develops a prototype system. First, four of the current best-performing general-purpose LLMs are selected for deployment as foundational models. Then, based on the general prompt framework of LLMs, schema for aircraft conceptual design solutions, and real-world design cases, task prompts for generating aircraft conceptual design solutions are crafted, resulting in three types of prompts: Full-Instruction, 1-Shot, and 5-Shot. Finally, the prototype system is utilized to design conceptual solutions, and the model-generated solutions are compared with those designed by engineers from both objective and subjective perspectives. The experimental results indicate that LLMs demonstrate conceptual design capabilities comparable to those of engineers, exhibiting strong generalization ability and potential for innovative design."

This systematic review study investigates how to design SRL activities using GenAI. We examined 73 articles published over the past five years, drawn from four databases: Web of Science, ProQuest, ERIC, and Scopus. This study has three major empirical findings. First, six pedagogical affordances from GenAI across the three phases of SRL—forethought, Performance, and self-reflection—are (i) creating personalized learning objectives; (ii) searching for, analyzing, and integrating resources; (iii) monitoring and evaluating progress; (iv) recommending learning strategies; (v) recording progress and providing feedback; and (vi) generating new ideas and examples. Second, popular student learning activities using GenAI in each phase are information searching in the forethought; strategies for problem-solving in the performance, and obtaining feedback and conducting self-assessments in the self-reflection. Third, two major dimensions influencing student engagement in SRL using GenAI are individual and environmental. Finally, we visualize how the three empirical findings relate to each other. Our findings help us understand how AI as a human-machine collaborative tool affects the SRL process. This study provides practical recommendations for facilitating SRL in GenAI-enhanced environments and offers guidance for the design and development of personalized GenAI learning tools."

Materials and methods We conducted a systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines. Studies investigating generative AI in IBD care were identified through PubMed and Embase (Jan 2020–Sep 2024). Results From 2875 records, 8 studies (2023–2024) met inclusion criteria: 5 on patient education, 2 on decision support, and 1 on research ideation. For patient education, ChatGPT provided clear and accurate responses, with accuracy reaching 84.2 \% in a study, though sometimes lacked consistency. In decision support, ChatGPT’s classifications of ulcerative colitis severity aligned with clinician assessments in 80 \% of cases and in 87.8 \% of cases for guideline-based dysplasia management. For research ideation, ChatGPT generated highly relevant (mean score: 4.9 ± 0.26) and clear (4.8 ± 0.41) questions, but lacked specificity (2.86/5) and originality (1.07/5).

    abstract = "Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications related to agriculture have recently gained in use and attention. They are indeed valuable tools for interpreting data, improving production chains, and optimizing the use of natural resources. Among AI models, the most recent and promising area is represented by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI). After an initial description of its general model architectures, this work aims to review its practical uses and potentials in the following individual sectors: agriculture, precision farming, and animal farming, as well as interdisciplinary applications. The literature search was carried out using the SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases. GAI holds immense potential for revolutionizing agriculture, offering solutions ranging from precision farming to pest management and supply chain optimization. Though some applications can extend beyond efficiency gains, and hallucinations occurrence i.e. false output information presented as fact, remains an open issue, GAI can be decisive for tasks like improving training datasets, refining models, and facilitating time series analysis. This review extensively describes the vital importance of these tasks for agriculture, precision and animal farming, caused by the rise of new technologies. As a result, by embracing and responsibly implementing GAI applications, it is possible to create a more sustainable and resilient future for agriculture and precision farming.

Considering the potential transformative impact of GenAI on university students' learning and research practices, this research examines the patterns of use, perceived benefits, and drawbacks of GenAI among undergraduates and postgraduates at universities in Hong Kong. This research employs the 5E instructional model to systematically investigate the effectiveness of GenAI tools in supporting learning and research among local university students. The 170 valid responses revealed generally positive perceptions of the benefits of using GenAI in learning and research-related activities. However, they also acknowledged its potential drawbacks on ethical issues such as plagiarism and academic dishonesty. In addition, respondents agreed that GenAI could effectively support their learning and research activities despite concerns about potential skill deficits, such as diminished critical thinking and analytical abilities caused by the excessive use of GenAI. These findings highlight the increasingly critical role that academic communities like libraries could play in promoting ethical, effective, and literate use of GenAI technologies through targeted training, tool curation, and research support services."

While generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has the potential to revolutionize green logistics, several barriers still prevent its widespread adoption. In existing literature, little is known about applications, drivers, enablers, critical barriers, and challenges associated with implementing GAI along with green logistics. To fill this gap, this study aims to systematically identify and assess the existing body of knowledge on the GAI and green logistics nexus, drawing on a systematic literature review carried out in compliance with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) protocol. The study identifies 34 key GAI-driven green logistics applications, 23 drivers and enablers, and 38 major barriers and challenges. The findings illustrate that GAI-driven green logistics applications, such as risk assessment and mitigation, decision support and real-time environmental response, resilience testing and scenario planning, are essential for developing sustainable logistics ecosystems. Organizational readiness, stakeholder collaboration, and supportive regulatory frameworks emerge as crucial enablers, while lack of digital infrastructure, investment costs, and regulatory gaps constitute significant barriers. The study proposes a decision-making framework to prioritize policy initiatives that could promote GAI adoption in green logistics. This research fills current knowledge gaps and has significant implications for supply chain stakeholders, scholars, and policymakers aiming to support sustainable and cutting-edge logistics systems."

With the growing integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, there is a pressing need to understand its potential as a clinical decision support tool. While Generative Artificial Intelligence models show high accuracy and consistency, their ability to navigate complex, context-sensitive scenarios remains in question. Objectives This study aimed to compare the clinical decision-making performance of emergency nurses from Israel and Italy with Generative Artificial Intelligence models (Claude-3.5, ChatGPT-4.0, and Gemini-1.5). It evaluated differences in severity assessment, hospitalization decisions, and test selection, while exploring the influence of demographic and professional characteristics on decision accuracy. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted among 82 emergency nurses (49 from Italy, 33 from Israel), each independently evaluating five standardized clinical cases. Their decisions were compared with those generated by Generative Artificial Intelligence models using a structured evaluation rubric. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, chi-square tests, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to assess predictive accuracy. Results Generative Artificial Intelligence models exhibited higher overall decision accuracy and stronger alignment with expert recommendations. However, notable discrepancies emerged in hospitalization decisions and severity assessments. For example, in Case 2, Generative Artificial Intelligence rated severity as level 1, while Italian and Israeli nurses rated it at 1.98 and 2.23, respectively (P < 0.01, F = 199). In Case 1, only 4.1 \% of Italian nurses recommended hospitalization compared to 30.3 \% of Israeli nurses, whereas all Generative Artificial Intelligence models advised hospitalization. Nurses showed greater variability in test selection and severity judgments, reflecting their use of clinical intuition and contextual reasoning. Demographics such as age, gender, and years of experience did not significantly predict accuracy. Conclusions Generative Artificial Intelligence models demonstrated consistency and expert alignment but lacked the contextual sensitivity vital in emergency care. These results highlight the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence as a clinical decision-support tool while emphasizing the continued importance of human clinical judgment."

However, there is limited evidence pertaining to the impact of AI-mediated instruction on postgraduate students’ psycho-affective factors and the overall learning climate in English as a foreign language (EFL) context. To address this gap, the present study drew on motivational climate theory (MCT) to explore postgraduate EFL students’ perceptions of the role of GAI technologies in their emotional engagement and goal orientation. To do so, an interview was conducted with 30 postgraduate students using maximum variation sampling. The results of the inductive thematic analysis revealed that AI-mediated instruction had affected both the emotional engagement and goal orientation of the students. In particular, it was found that GAI tools fostered emotional engagement by ‘enlightening teacher-student classroom relationships’, ‘making the overall classroom culture/climate engaging, motivating, and updated’, ‘improving teachers’ action, instruction, and feedback quality’, ‘providing a personalized, interactive, and autonomy supporting education’, and ‘taping into learner-specific idiosyncrasies and individual differences’. Furthermore, GAI tools affected the students’ goal orientation by ‘facilitating the mastery of course content’, ‘setting personalized and achievable goals’, ‘fostering students’ performance comparison in the classroom’, and ‘providing a reflective and adaptive learning environment’. The findings are discussed and implications are provided for EFL teachers, students, teacher educators, and policymakers concerning the interplay of GAI, emotions, goal orientation, and motivational climate."

Although the supervised models now in use are competent, they frequently rely on annotated datasets and create challenges regarding uninterpretability and limited generalization ability. To overcome the limitations, this research proposes a Generative Artificial Intelligence Sequence to sequence the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers model to generate concise summaries. During the generation of the output sequence, the model takes into account data from various segments of the input sequence by utilizing a modified abstractive cross-attention technique. Specifically, the Generative Artificial Intelligence assists in removing grammatical mistakes in summaries via the application of the Global Surrogate method, which ensures the clarity and fluency of the output summary. In addition, the encoder-decoder model enables the accurate summary generation process, vastly improving fluency and accuracy. Furthermore, the experimental outcomes show that the Generative Artificial Intelligence Sequence to sequence the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers model surpasses the conventional text summarization techniques concerning Bilingual Evaluation Understudy of 0.71 and Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering of 0.73, which shows that the proposed model generates a meaningful summary from the given text."

Unequal learning preparation commonly exists among learners with varying socioeconomic and academic backgrounds, and can further exacerbate the educational divide. By reducing learning cost and providing less prepared learners with personalized delivery of information and knowledge, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) may help mitigate disparities in learning preparation. In this study, we investigate the roles of learners' use of GenAI in their learning processes, considering varying levels of learners’ prior learning preparation and proficiency in GenAI use. Specifically, we examine the effects of the use of GenAI tools on learning outcomes through its impacts on perceived informational benefit, learning cost, and knowledge fit in the focal learning process, moderated by learning preparation and GenAI proficiency of learners. Based on an experiment in a programming learning context, we find that although GenAI use significantly reduces learning cost, especially for less prepared learners, the cost reduction effect has not been translated into improved learning outcomes. We find no significant moderating effects of learning preparation on how GenAI use affects informational benefit and knowledge fit, further showing that GenAI tools have not yet been effectively utilized to help less prepared learners or reduce the educational divide. As indicated by the significant moderating roles of GenAI proficiency, to fully leverage the power of GenAI, improving GenAI proficiency can be crucial to ensure learning effectiveness for learners with different levels of learning preparation."

Findings GenAI chatbots’ responses were found to perform medium-to-high in terms of relevance, accuracy, specificity and justification. For the UK sample, the amount of investment had a marginal effect but prompt timing had an interesting impact. Unlike the British sample, the GenAI application, prompt timing and investment amount did not significantly influence the Bulgarian respondents’ evaluations.

The first was a survey comprising demographic and metaphor-related questions, and the second involved metaphor checking, in which participants provided screenshots of their interactions with GenAI. The data, which were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively, yielded 53 unique metaphors for the concept of GenAI in academic writing. We divided these into four conceptual categories in what we term the 4T Pyramid Model: Technical Support (representative metaphor: high-heeled shoes), Text Development (compass), Transformative Potential (Spider-Man), and Threat (drug).

While recent studies have demonstrated GAI's promising capabilities in processing static emotional content, the frontier of dynamic social cognition – where multiple modalities converge to create naturalistic social scenarios – remained largely unexplored. This study advances our understanding by examining the social-cognitive capabilities of Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro model through its performance on the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC), a sophisticated instrument designed to evaluate mentalization abilities using dynamic audiovisual stimuli. We compared the model's performance to a human normative sample (N = 1230) across varying temperature settings (a parameter controlling the level of randomness in the AI's output, where lower values lead to more deterministic responses and higher values increase variability; set at 0, 0.5, and 1). Results revealed that Gemini 1.5 Pro consistently performed above chance across all conditions (all corrected ps < 0.001, Cohen's h range = 1.17–1.41) and significantly outperformed the human sample mean (Z = 2.24, p = .025; Glass's Δ = 0.92, 95 \% CI [0.11, 1.72]; Hedges' g = 0.92, 95 \% CI [0.12, 1.72]).

These findings extend our understanding of artificial social cognition to complex multimodal processing while raising important questions about the nature of machine-based social understanding. The implications span theoretical considerations in artificial Theory of Mind to practical applications in mental health care and social skills training, though careful consideration is warranted regarding the fundamental differences between human and artificial social cognitive processing."

However, its current research landscape remains fragmented, with limited synthesis of trends and unclear pathways for adoption in the construction industry. To address these gaps, a mixed-method review is conducted, combining bibliometric analysis to quantitatively map research trends with qualitative thematic synthesis for in-depth contextual insights. A total of 148 publications were retrieved from Scopus and Google Scholar (2014–2024). The bibliometric analysis identified 49 high-frequency keywords, grouped into six thematic clusters, characterizing the quantitative research landscape. Complementing this, the qualitative synthesis examined five dominant application domains: (1) proactive safety monitoring and risk prevention, (2) generative AI for sustainable construction, (3) automating design through generative intelligence, (4) construction education, and (5) construction management, within which key research gaps and practical challenges are critically examined. Building upon these insights, the study proposes four-level research roadmap spanning (1) industry-level considerations, (2) organizational and stakeholder perspectives, (3) project-level perspectives, and (4) technological integration. Unlike prior reviews that concentrated on isolated single-model technologies or narrowly defined domains, this study offers a comprehensive, cross-domain analysis of generative AI for construction. By employing a mixed-method review—integrating quantitative bibliometric mapping and qualitative thematic synthesis—it bridges technical, organizational, and implementation perspectives to deliver a holistic understanding of the field.

In this study, an intelligent predictive framework using a generative artificial intelligence model is presented, which predicts the gas sensitivity of target materials with remarkable speed and accuracy. To validate the proposed framework, a material database is constructed using ZnO doped with eight different metal atoms, which serves as representative materials. Subsequently, 25 physical parameters, including crystal structure and electronic structure, are calculated using first-principles calculations. Eight intelligent learning models are then trained to predict sensitivity, with the Extremely Randomized Trees model performing the best, achieving a mean square error of 0.02. By combining feature engineering with generative artificial intelligence models, a novel model based on intrinsic atomic features (radius, electronegativity, first ionization energy) is developed, which enables the prediction of CO gas sensitivity in doped ZnO using the generated 12 key parameters, without any parameters from first principle calculation, thus significantly reducing the time and cost associated with discovering gas-sensitive properties. This predictive framework can be easily extended to other materials, facilitating the functional development of materials."

To estimate the short- and medium-term effects, we use a variety of methods, including a difference-in-discontinuity approach exploiting the exogenous nature of the unanticipated launch of ChatGPT in 2022. There is a strong short- and medium-term decline in the intensity of searches for vacancies, indicating a notable reduction in the supply of young people actively seeking apprenticeships and suggesting great uncertainty among the affected cohort. Occupations with a high proportion of cognitive tasks and with high demands on language skills were particularly affected by the decline. Interestingly, the revealed preferences in the search behavior of young job seekers contrasted with previous expert assessments on the automation risks of occupations and aligned with the most recent assessments of the AI and language model exposure of occupations – before these new assessments existed. Notably, while the supply decline did not reduce the number of signed apprenticeship contracts, we find evidence of declining applicant quality, particularly for commercial employees, the most widely offered apprenticeship in Switzerland."

However, it is certain that AI is here to stay, and it is crucial that educators embrace this technology and teach students to use this resource carefully and wisely. Communication is an essential component in nursing practice and cultivating competent writing skills is a vital aspect of nursing education. However, nursing students struggle with scholarly writing especially at the undergraduate level. Integrating generative artificial intelligence into a writing intensive course offers a unique approach to aid students in improving their writing. In this pilot project, students were given an assignment to actively engage with generative artificial intelligence and critically analyze the response using current nursing literature to support or refute the output. This assignment was used to springboard class discussion on advantages and disadvantages of using artificial intelligence for scholarly writing. This novel approach has the potential to build confidence and competence in novice writers which supports their success in nursing school and in clinical practice."

It is an emerging area where research and education face new challenges as new knowledge keeps coming in. During this process, generative artificial intelligence (GAI) plays a critical role in education and research activities. However, GAI's impact on smart energy systems research and education is less discussed. Especially, its impact on education is rarely discussed when compared to research. GAI reshapes both the research process and the roles of teachers and students in the course. This perspective offers insights into the ongoing research and education paradigm shifts observed in the smart energy system. This perspective synthesizes existing studies on "GAI for Science" and "GAI for Education" practices in the field of smart energy systems. In research, the impact of GAI is discussed from both macro and micro levels. In education, this perspective examines how a GAI-driven teaching approach addresses the challenges of teaching smart energy systems compared to the traditional approach. This perspective could benefit the discussion of GAI-reshaped research and education in energy science.}

This review article looks into the uses and effects of generative artificial intelligence in psychology. We employed a systematic selection process, encompassing papers published between 2015 and 2024 from databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore, using keywords like “Generative AI in psychology” “ChatGPT and behavior modeling” and “AI in mental health”. First, the paper goes over the fundamental ideas of generative AI and lists its uses in data analysis, behavior modeling, and social interaction simulation. A detailed comparison table has been added to contrast conventional research methodologies with GenAI-based approaches in psychology studies. Next, analyzing the theoretical and ethical issues that generative AI raises for psychological research, it highlights how crucial it is to develop a coherent theoretical framework. This study illustrates the benefits of generative AI in handling vast amounts of data and increasing research efficiency by contrasting traditional research methods with AI-driven methodologies. Regarding particular uses, the study explores how generative AI might be used to simulate social interactions, analyze massive amounts of text, and learn about cognitive processes. Section 5 has been expanded to include discussions on political biases, geographic biases, and other biases. In conclusion, the paper looks forward to the future development of generative AI in psychology research and suggests techniques for improving it. We have included methodological solutions such as the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach and human-in-the-loop systems, as well as data privacy solutions like open-source local LLMs. In summary, generative AI has the potential to revolutionize psychological research, but in order to maintain the moral and scientific integrity of the field, ethical and theoretical concerns must be carefully considered before applying the technology."

In order to overcome the limitations of traditional journal cover design and enhance the artistic quality and communicative effectiveness of journal covers, this study proposes a method for designing international scientific journal covers driven by artificial intelligence. The method integrates numerous generative artificial intelligence technologies and multi-criteria decision-making methods, applying them to the design practice of food science journals, thereby improving the efficiency of journal cover design and publication. The integrated method first uses the coding method of grounded theory to extract five design dimensions critical to journal cover design and constructs a triple-mapping relationship model of technological translatability, visual expressiveness, and alignment with public cognition and cultural background, providing a research foundation for organizing design elements to align with the journal’s positioning. The DeepSeek large language model is employed to generate creative keywords for the journal cover, which are then translated into descriptive instructions recognizable by Midjourney. Subsequently, Midjourney is used to generate preliminary cover sketches to quickly visualise the creative concept, and the controlnet function of Stable Diffusion is employed to control the outline of the sketch’s line art, followed by experimentation and optimisation across dimensions such as visual style and tonal range. Finally, the VIKOR method is applied to evaluate and rank the six generated cover design proposals. The evaluation criteria encompass scientific content expression, visual aesthetics, and communication and acceptance, across three dimensions with fifteen indicators. The selected design proposals are then subjected to collaborative optimisation between human input and artificial intelligence. The integrated method offers a systematic and innovative framework, enhancing the efficiency, creativity, and visual impact of journal cover design, and provides both theoretical and practical references for future academic publishing."

This paper proposes a generative artificial intelligence (AI) embedded thermodynamic modeling method of GTs for adaptive performance matching. Possible component performance curves are automatically generated by the variational autoencoder in the shape view. Speed-dependent map sampling coefficients of the curves are introduced to realize fast matching of various operating conditions. The proposed method is verified on 2 different types of in-service GTs in the industrial field with mean absolute percentage error 0.5\% and 0.54\%, respectively. The maximum reduction of performance prediction error is 2.37\% compared to traditional methods. The proposed method can realize high-precision GT performance adaptive prediction with good generalization and applicability, thus providing guidance for high efficiency operation control and health management. This paper shows an interpretable and reliable approach for the integration of AI with thermodynamics. Following the proposed generative-embedded modeling paradigm, performance prediction of other complex energy systems can also benefit."

In the era of developed information technology systems, the dynamics of knowledge creation and dissemination have also changed. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)—an embedded entity in the knowledge management system—has become a prominent area of research nowadays, while accountability, transparency, and ethics are common research agendas in institutional economics related to GenAI. The research in this paper has investigated the convictions behind GenAI adoption and how to develop a GenAI governance framework. The research adopts a qualitative approach to investigate the problem and surveys undergraduate students to explore their motive for using GenAI. The study sheds analytical light on institutional economists’ view on the governance of GenAI. The study has found a positive relationship between perceived benefits and the adoption of GenAI in education by students. The theoretical model will have a considerable impact on the ongoing debate on the governance of GenAI and knowledge management systems."

The initial reactions from educators have drawn a mixed response about the application of GenAI in management education, where some consider it a ‘watershed’ phenomenon, while others consider it an ‘existential threat’ to the teaching-learning system. Subscribing to the positive view, this paper argues that educators must promote the responsible use of AI-based tools, and imposing any artificial restraint on the application of GenAI technology can be deleterious to students' advancement. This is because GenAI will automate future jobs and create new jobs that do not exist today. As organizations are moving towards skill-based hiring, management education must prepare graduates with the requisite technical and human skills required for future jobs. However, previous studies have invested a lot of attention towards the technical aspect of the integration of GenAI tools by recommending capacity development programs to understand the nuances of new technology. However, they have overlooked the important aspect of adopting technology, i.e., attitudes and behavioral rigidities among educators. For this purpose, we argue that to overcome such a rigid mindset, institutions must focus on an unlearning mechanism comprising three phases: destabilizing triggers, discarding existing practices, and experimenting with new ones to help educators adopt GenAI tools in the education system. This study offers multiple theoretical and practical implications. It is a response to a call from researchers to apply existing theories to inform management scholarship about the implementation of GenAI technology and overcome educators' apprehensions that impede the ethical application of GenAI in management education."

Findings draw a detailed picture of the state of GenAI research. In total, 170 published articles are reviewed based on topics, theories, and methods. Three main topic clusters are identified: 1) antecedents of using GenAI; 2) impacts and applications of GenAI; and 3) technicalities of GenAI. Theoretically, most studies have borrowed foundations from other fields without substantial development. Methodologically, existing research—particularly in tourism—has tended to feature quantitative techniques. This research also compares business and tourism literature based on an antecedents, process and outcomes framework, outlining potential research gaps and opportunities. In addition to synthesizing the current research landscape, this paper presents a multidimensional framework (i.e., theories, contexts, characteristics, and methods – TCCM) that suggests multiple future research questions to inform GenAI studies in tourism."

The focus is to see how the information type, model complexity, and prompt structure collectively affect the collaboration. A set of case studies demonstrate that a modular modeling approach with low-level information improves prompt efficiency and modeling accuracy, especially in complex scenarios. This strategy also enables novice and expert users to collaborate with GenAI in solving challenging real-world CAD tasks effectively.

Moreover, little research has explored whether and why consumers are willing to use GAI to generate online reviews. By conducting two experiments, this study investigates how consumers respond differently to GAI-generated reviews versus human-generated reviews and identifies potential factors that influence consumers’ willingness to use GAI to generate reviews. Findings indicate that although there is no significant difference in consumers’ perceptions between human-generated and GAI-generated reviews in terms of review credibility, review richness, and review usefulness, only half of the participants are willing to use GAI to generate reviews. Further analysis results suggest that individuals who consider GAI unethical tend to avoid using GAI. Those with high personal innovativeness are more willing to use GAI to generate online reviews. Our findings deepen the understanding of consumer attitudes toward GAI-generated reviews and provide implications for the deployment of GAI in the online review system."

It uses an extension of the technology acceptance model (TAM) with a modified framework that incorporates two key factors: self-efficacy and subjective norm. Data were collected from a sample of 367 primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong using questionnaires containing items for six constructs: self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude towards using, subjective norm, and behavioural intention. The results show that fostering teachers' self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, and attitude is essential for successfully increasing their behavioural intention to use GenAI tools. Subjective norm was also found to influence teachers' behavioural intention. To enhance teachers' effective use of GenAI for teaching, teacher development programmes should focus on equipping teachers with comprehensive conceptual knowledge and skills and an understanding of the application of these tools to teaching and learning. Policy support to create a conducive environment for the use of GenAI in teaching and learning would also be beneficial.

The 3D preform shape is simplified by expressing it in a two-dimensional manner based on the geometric features of the forged shape. A beta-variational autoencoder (β-VAE) serves as the generative model, paired with a surrogate model using deep neural networks (DNN) to explore and optimise preform geometries efficiently. The initial training dataset for the generative model is created using isosurfaces derived from Laplace’s equation. A multi-objective optimisation framework is developed to minimise forging load and flash volume and mitigate underfill and lap defects. Preforms were designed using this method and validated through forging experiments on two target geometries: a brake calliper and an electric vehicle (EV) manifold. The forging results of the optimised preforms were compared with traditional isosurface methods, demonstrating that the proposed method reduces forging load and flash volume while preventing underfill and lap defects. This integrated approach combines advanced computational techniques with practical validation, offering a systematic and adaptable solution for the challenges associated with 3D preform design in forging processes."

This extension fills gaps in our understanding of the psychosocial factors influencing the adoption of GenAI tools in higher education. We used a questionnaire and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze data collected from 257 French management science students across different institutions. The results show that the most significant factors are performance expectancy, habit, hedonic motivation, and trust. These factors explain 49.3\% of the intention to use GenAI tools, 58.7\% of the intention to adopt them, and 39.6\% of the intention to recommend them.

Additionally, it provides practical recommendations for educators, policymakers, and technology providers to promote the integration of GenAI tools in management science education and prepare students for future professional environments centred on GenAI tools."

By leveraging GAI to analyze International Patent Classification (IPC) definitions and benchmark reports, we developed a system that rapidly generates technology-function matrices, significantly reducing the time required for manual analysis. The method was applied to 2,399 quantum technology patents from 2023 to March 2024, covering four key areas: secure communications, computing, quantum simulators, and sensors. This approach not only aids government agencies in identifying new technological opportunities but also facilitates the industrialization of potential technologies. By combining GAI with established analytical frameworks, this study contributes to both the theoretical understanding and practical application of patent analysis in emerging fields."

Though a focus for this emerging technology is academic misconduct, we sought to leverage GenAI in curriculum structure to facilitate educational outcomes. For instructors, GenAI offers new opportunities in course design and management while reducing time requirements to evaluate outcomes and personalizing learner feedback. These include innovative instructional designs such as flipped classrooms and gamification, enriching teaching methodologies with focused and interactive approaches, and team-based exercise development among others. For learners, GenAI offers unprecedented self-directed learning opportunities, improved cognitive engagement, and effective retrieval practices, leading to enhanced autonomy, motivation, and knowledge retention. Though empowering, this evolving landscape has integration challenges and ethical considerations, including accuracy, technological evolution, loss of learner’s voice, and socioeconomic disparities. Our experience demonstrates that the responsible application of GenAI’s in educational settings will revolutionize learning practices, making education more accessible and tailored, producing positive motivational outcomes for both learners and instructors. Thus, we argue that leveraging GenAI in educational settings will improve outcomes with implications extending from primary through higher and continuing education paradigms."

Adversarial training methods were used in video processing to optimize the generated model, enabling it to map between different styles and achieve style transfer. The generative adversarial network was optimized using a cyclic consistency loss function to ensure consistency of video content before and after editing. Based on the trained recurrent generative adversarial network, style transformation and content editing on the video were performed.

    abstract = "The manufacturing sector is in a challenging spot. Confronted with persistent cost pressures, supply chain instability, and disruptive technologies like as 3D printing and the Internet of Things. The industry must consistently optimise processes, enhance efficiency, and improve overall equipment performance. Simultaneously, there is a significant surge in sustainability and energy transition. Manufacturers are being urged to decrease their carbon emissions, embrace circular economy principles, and enhance their overall environmental sustainability. Manufacturers are under pressure to consistently innovate while still assuring stability and safety. An erroneous AI forecast in a marketing campaign may cause small inconvenience, whereas an erroneous AI forecast on a manufacturing shopfloor can have catastrophic consequences. Manufacturers are familiar with technology and disruption, but the main issue is that what is effective in principle often proves unsuccessful in practice. As producers, we have established a knowledge base; nevertheless, it is difficult for users to locate information efficiently as it requires extensive time and effort to search and navigate through the contents. Alternatively, we can establish a data lake that may rapidly deteriorate into a data swamp. Alternatively, we can continue to incorporate other applications, so perpetuating the growth of our technological debt. However, we are now incapable of updating our applications due to the presence of intricate and long-standing logic within them. The implementation requirements and applications of generative artificial intelligence differ from those of analytical AI. Analytical artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used for the purposes of predicting future events, optimising desired values, and utilising past data to enhance processes and results. Gen AI represents a new opportunity for problem solutions, as demonstrated by recent advancements in content production, insight generation, and human-like engagement. There is an urgent need for additional scholarly research to gain a deeper understanding of how Gen-AI technologies are being adopted and spread across different industries in production systems.

This innovative practice full paper presents a study into using GenAI to enhance student learning of software engineering. It outlines the initiatives to introduce GenAI into a graduate-level software engineering course in Software Verification and Validation (SV\&V). The paper presents the educational goals, methodologies and findings of these endeavors in this course. The primary education goal of this course is that students have a solid understanding of principles and practices of software quality assurance and seek to introduce students to diverse techniques employed for SV\&V. The study presented in this paper centers on the practical application of GenAI within the domain of testing strategies. The paper introduces the findings of an exercise where GenAI was used to apply testing strategies for unit testing. The exercise consisted of the use of GenAI in the development of unit tests for an algorithm. Rigorous assessments were conducted to gauge the effectiveness of the unit tests developed for validating the accurate implementation of the algorithm. This exploration shed light on the tangible impact of GenAI on the precision and efficiency of unit testing procedures. The findings underscore the significance of encouraging students to actively explore emerging trends and methodologies in the realm of software verification and validation. By incorporating GenAI into the educational framework, students not only gain insights into the capabilities and limitations of this technology but also foster a mindset of continuous learning in software quality assurance. The paper demonstrates that it is not sufficient to use the test cases developed by GenAI for software validation since test cases recommended by GenAI do not cover corner cases which causes gaps in coverage in unit testing. The majority of the students were able to understand the limitation of GenAI in SV\&V but appreciated its support in suggesting test cases for the most common cases. This exercise allowed students to enhance their creative problem-solving through human-guided AI partnership which is pivotal in cultivating a new generation of professionals capable of contributing to the ongoing evolution of software quality.",

Finally, the results revealed that students use and understand basic concepts of GAI tools, recognize their limitations, and are thus familiar with them.

In the Green Phase, the TDD developer writes production code to make the test pass as quickly as possible. Finally, in the refactor phase, the TDD developer “cleans” written code. In this demo paper, we present GAI4-TDD (Generative Artificial Intelligence for Test-Driven Development), a PyCharm plugin to support the Green Phase of TDD. Specifically, this plugin generates production code from the tests the TDD developer had written in the Red Phase so that the generated code makes these tests pass. Previous studies have shown that TDD can be beneficial not only in the “traditional” software development context but also in the Embedded Systems (ESs) development context. We preliminary assessed GAI4-TDD in the latter context through a laboratory empirical study on three ESs. We observed that in the greater part of the cases, GAI4- TDD generates production code that successfully implements the chunk of functionality required.

The generative AI uses a diffusion model and incorporates a transformer model to output a series of innovative and practical antenna structures according to the input antenna requirements. To select the optimal structure from a large set of candidates, we further incorporate the Characteristic Mode Analysis (CMA) method into the Bilinear Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNN) model for evaluation and selection. The antenna inverse design scheme cleverly combines AI with the CMA method, which greatly simplifies the tedious process of traditional antenna design. By simply inputting the antenna requirements, the optimal antenna structure, distinct from existing datasets, can be rapidly obtained. Since the output is an antenna structure, it is not limited to a specific frequency band, thus offering design flexibility for cross-band adjustments. This letter presents case studies on single-band, dual-band, and wideband circularly polarized microstrip antennas to validate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

    abstract = "This study examines the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and the work environment on the motivation of formal workers in DKI Jakarta Province. Using IBM SPSS 29 for data analysis, 402 formal workers participated via online questionnaires. Results indicate that GAI positively correlates with work motivation (regression coefficient=0.71, t = 10.98, p < 0.001). Likewise, a favourable work climate considerably boosts motivation (β = 0.63, t = 12.21, p < 0.001). Also, the work environment was found to have a significant indirect effect on the GAI-motivation relationship (β = 0.55, p < 0.001). The results of this research imply that the implementation of sophisticated AI technologies and a favourable organisational climate are the keys to increasing employees’ effectiveness and engagement. Despite the study’s short data collection period, the results are indicative. Strategic investments in GAI and improvements in the work environment could significantly enhance the motivation of Jakarta’s 3.08 million formal workers. This paper provides valuable insights into leveraging GAI and work environment factors to improve employee well-being in Jakarta’s dynamic work context.",

    abstract = "Literary studies critically examine fictional texts, exploring their structures, themes, stylistic features, and cultural-historical contexts. A central challenge in this field lies in bridging textual analysis with the spatial and sensory dimensions of settings described or implied in texts. Traditional methodologies often require scholars to mentally reconstruct these environments, leading to incomplete or inconsistent interpretations. Readers may be biased by their personal context or experiences, or may lack detailed knowledge of the relevant historical facts. This paper argues for the integration of virtual reality and generative artificial intelligence as supporting instruments to enhance literary research. The former enables immersive, spatially accurate reconstructions of historical environments, while the latter provides tools such as text-to-image and text-to-3D generation which let us dynamically render visual elements quoted in literary texts. Together, these technologies have the potential to significantly enhance traditional literature analysis methodologies, enabling novel approaches for contextualizing and analyzing literature in its spatial and cultural milieu.",

The experiment uses public cultural data sets and self-built characteristic cultural corpora, covering scenes such as poetry creation, film and television poster design, and music melody generation. In the poetry generation task, the BLEU-4 score of poetry generated by MM-GAN reached 0.45, which is higher than the 0.32 of traditional GAN and other baseline models. In the film and television poster design experiment, the average perceptual similarity between the generated poster and the target style is 0.88, far exceeding the comparison algorithm. In terms of music melody generation, the average harmonic rationality score of the generated melody is 4.2 (out of 5 points). The results show that MM-GAN is significantly superior to traditional algorithms in terms of cultural creation quality, style fit and semantic coherence, and can effectively assist cultural creation and dissemination, providing a new path for the development of this field.",

These factors exhibited interactive effects, and the response surface model revealed an optimal approach for applying GAI to enhance awareness. Building on these insights, practical suggestions are proposed for using GAI to enhance digital literacy.

This paper proposes GenAI-SC, a generative semantic communication architecture that utilizes large-scale pre-training models for semantic information extraction and adopts a diffusion model as its core. The architecture extracts and compresses semantic information through large-scale models and utilizes diffusion models to achieve high-quality image recovery, which is especially suitable for complex communication environments. To verify the effectiveness of this architecture, this paper design two task modes, plain text diffusion image generation and text-image joint diffusion generation, to flexibly cope with different transmission tasks. The experimental results show that GenAI-SC performs well under different channel conditions and inference steps, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio environment, showing that GenAI-SC has good multitasking capability and communication robustness.

This study developed three distinct AI-powered learning strategies - Inquiry Learning, Collaborative Learning and Dialogic Learning - to establish a Generative AI Programming Teaching Model specifically for junior high students. Using a quasi-experimental approach, the research compared the effectiveness of this AI teaching model against traditional methods by implementing them in separate seventh-grade classes at a Y City middle school. The results of the study show that (1) The holistic application of generative AI learning strategies significantly enhanced junior high school students' programming learning engagement. (2) Generative AI learning strategies can enhance middle school students' emotional engagement. (3) Generative AI learning strategies can enhance middle school students' cognitive engagement. (4) Generative AI learning strategies can enhance middle school students' behavioral engagement. The study makes recommendations for the experimental results in order to provide references for improving programming learning engagement.",

    abstract = "Chronic disease management requires continuous care to prevent exacerbations, yet providing 24/7 accessible medical advice is a significant challenge for care providers. The current model of periodic patient visits with standard dialogue responses fails to adequately address the individualized needs of patients and caregivers. This lack of personalized guidance undermines treatment adherence and satisfaction. To bridge this gap, we developed a novel approach leveraging generative AI (GAI) to optimize patient-manager interactions. Focusing on prevalent chronic conditions such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and dementia, we created intelligent dialogue agents that deliver tailored, actionable nursing recommendations aligning with each case's unique circumstances. The developed methodology began by curating a corpus of 30 frequently asked questions on home care, emotional support, and social factors from online patient data across the three diseases. We employed prompt engineering to precisely define the virtual roles of nurses and physicians while implementing a “Rephrase and Respond” (RAR) protocol to enhance query comprehension and generate reliable solutions. The RAR approach solves problems by question restating, followed by contextualized recommendations from the language model. Clinical expert feedback iteratively refined the system's outputs. The evaluation result showed an average gain of 10\% in response and an increase of 5\% in readability after optimization. The optimized RAR method of large language models effectively improved the quality of nursing advice for chronic disease, aligned with patients' emotional and social needs. The RAR method in medical advisory areas, including chronic disease management and rehabilitation care, enhances the quality and practicality of nursing advice in these domains.",

The research proposes hypotheses that teachers' adoption of Generative Artificial Intelligence in educational instruction is influenced by seven factors: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, visibility, information channels, and teachers' personal innovativeness. Through correlation analysis, it is discovered that these influencing factors are significantly correlated with teachers' adoption and application of Generative Artificial Intelligence in educational instruction. Regression analysis further reveals that compatibility and visibility have significant positive predictive effects on teachers' adoption of Generative Artificial Intelligence. Based on the data results, this study proposes corresponding strategies to further enhance the diffusion of Generative Artificial Intelligence, aiming to improve the quality and efficiency of teachers' educational instruction, reduce their workload, and promote educational equity and high-quality balanced development.",

However, their inherently contradictory characteristics present significant challenges to direct knowledge sharing. Furthermore, conventional methods that independently optimize fine-tuning and inference lack the foresight to achieve long-term network benefits. To address these challenges, we propose the GAI-oriented synthetic network (GaisNet), a collaborative cloud-edge-end intelligence framework that integrates fine-tuning and inference. GaisNet, specifically, can mitigate contradictions by leveraging data-free knowledge relays, where bidirectional knowledge flow facilitates a virtuous cycle of model fine-tuning and task inference with a long-term perspective, fostering mutualism between GAI and EI in the IIoV. A case study illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the future challenges and directions in the interplay between GAI and EI.",

The data, information, knowledge, and work (DIKW) hierarchy is a useful framework for teaching and for checking metacognitive and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) literacy. There are two types of collaboration between GAI and human intelligence: a combined intelligence model and a parallel intelligence model. The combined intelligence model is a method of using GAI for creating works by collecting data, organizing information, and deriving knowledge from information. This model is suitable for GAI-assisted tasks (GAIATs). The parallel intelligence model is suitable for GAI-assisted learning (GAIAL); it is a method in which a person develops abilities by analyzing and comparing tasks created by GAI after going through the data-information-knowledge-work process. The zone of proximal development (ZPD) created by educational scaffolding is a quantitative framework that is appropriate for evaluating the effects of GAI. The ZPD generated by GAI that corresponds to scaffolding should be managed so as not to favor or disadvantage specific individuals.",

Analysis is interpreting data and involves drawing conclusions based on the information gathered. Medical Image Analysis aims to extract insights using various computational techniques. This process includes exploring, manipulating, visualizing, segmenting, classifying, and registering both 2D and 3D images. In addition, it encompasses reconstructing image data from medical imaging tools, like X\&\#x2010;rays, ultrasounds, CT scans, MRIs, PET scans (positron emission tomography), SPECT scans (single photon emission computed tomography), and microscopy. The motto is to generate visual representations of internal body parts for medical and clinical assessments. This analysis is required for automating operations of healthcare like cell counting, detecting anomalies like cancerous cells, segmenting tumor tissues, measuring oxygen saturation, and reconstructing 3D representations for diagnostic and treatment planning. These days, high\&\#x2010;end computing is necessary for many medical image processing and analysis techniques in order to minimize the requisite runtime. This review's primary goal is to offer a comprehensive reference for medical image analysis and morphological methods that have recently benefited from high\&\#x2010;performance computing technologies.</p> <p>Now, let us understand the term morphology; it is an inspection of an organism's form, structure, and unique structural characteristics. Here, we go over some of its features and introduce the fundamental morphological transformations. We also provide a synopsis of the morphological filtering theory.

The goal is to build a general-purpose prediction engine that can automatically generate predictions from tabular data with minimal or no more training data. Although LLMs excel at text generation, they struggle with business-related data that is tabular and has challenges with categorisation, regression, and prediction. In fact, the SAP Foundation Model can compete with and even surpass these conventional methods while providing the flexibility of foundation models; in contrast, state-of-the-art LLMs perform 20-50\% worse than incumbent restricted AI approaches in comparable cases. SAP has a long track record of successfully meeting business needs, and the company's stated goal is to develop AI that is useful, trustworthy, and socially conscious so that it can assist clients in solving their business challenges. Another innovative strategy for AI development, federated learning is quickly becoming the standard for delivering AI apps to the periphery of industrial networks.

To achieve this, a series of independent variables are defined such as GPU Memory Access, Memory Bandwidth, Throughput, Power Consumption, Temperature, and Clock Speed. With the RBF algorithm, these sub-metrics are analyzed taking into consideration the number of units that may be in each of the hidden layers and the level of importance of the variable, while, with the MLP, the number of units established both in hidden layer 1 and 2, respectively, and the importance level and normalized importance to analyze the behavior of these sub-metrics.

The results showed that ChatGPT does not store previous inputs and is not able to reconstruct personal data retroactively if they were not explicitly provided to it in each request. Based on the results obtained, it can be assumed that the use of ChatGPT when processing pseudonymized data does not pose a risk of violating the protection of personal data.

    abstract = "Over the past few decades, immersive technologies have completely transformed the world around us. Recent trends show that the next digital transformation will directly impact the way people live, communicate, work, trade and learn and will be powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Generative artificial intelligence has had to face significant higher education challenges since its appearance, requiring the development of new and innovative teaching and learning practices. Nevertheless, the assimilation of such immersive technologies necessarily brings with it many challenges, advantages, and risks, which have led to differing opinions among educators, students, and academics. This paper provides a preliminary reflection on the risks and benefits that higher education students perceive in the formal use of this type of tool for academic purposes. An exit survey was used to verify the initial opinions of the students, obtaining almost 90 percent of positive perceptions, but only considering AI as a support tool. In contrast, a significant percentage mentioned that there could be some risks in using this technology: dependency on AI tools, loss of creativity and plagiarism according to institutional policies. Despite its innovative and significant importance, the students acknowledge that the tool is imperfect and accept several disadvantages, such as incorrect answers, poor quality references and the production of unsafe content, so its use must regulate and for now remain only as a complementary support tool.",

In this study, a human-centered learning and teaching framework that uses generative AI tools for self-regulated learning development through domain knowledge learning was proposed to catalyze changes in educational practices. The framework illustrates how generative AI tools can revolutionize educational practices and transform the processes of teaching and learning to become human-centered. It emphasizes the evolving roles of teachers, who increasingly become skillful facilitators and humanistic storytellers who craft differentiated instructions and attempt to develop students’ individualized learning. Drawing upon insights from neuroscience, the framework guides students to employ generative AI tools to augment their attentiveness, stimulate active engagement in learning, receive immediate feedback, and encourage self-reflection. The pedagogical approach is also reimagined; teachers equipped with generative AI tools and AI literacy can refine their teaching strategies to better equip students to meet future challenges. The practical application of the framework is demonstrated in a case study involving the development of Chinese language writing ability among primary students within a K–12 educational context. This article also reports the results of a 60-h development programme for teachers. Specifically, providing in-service teachers with cases involving uses of the proposed framework helped them to better understand the generative AI concepts and integrate them into their teaching and learning and increased their perceived ability to design AI-integrated courses that would enhance students’ attention, engagement, confidence, and satisfaction.",

It identifies and highlights the role of different stakeholders (university management, students, staff, etc.) during the adoption process. It also proposes an objective approach based upon an evaluation matrix to assess the success and outcome of the GenAI adoption. Background: Universities worldwide are debating and struggling with the adoption of GenAI in their curriculum. GenAI has impacted our perspective on traditional methods of academic integrity and the scholarship of teaching, learning, and research. Both the faculty and students are unsure about the approach in the absence of clear guidelines through the administration and regulators. This requires an established framework to define a process and articulate the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder involved. Research Questions: Whether the academic ecosystem requires a methodology to adopt GenAI into its curriculum? A systematic approach for the academic staff to ensure the students’ learning outcomes are met with the adoption of GenAI. How to measure and communicate the adoption of GenAI in the university setup? Methodology: The methodology employed in this study focuses on examining the university education system and assessing the opportunities and challenges related to incorporating GenAI in teaching and learning. Additionally, it identifies a gap and the absence of a comprehensive framework that obstructs the effective integration of GenAI within the academic environment. Findings: The literature survey results indicate the limited or no adoption of GenAI by the university, which further reflects the dilemma in the minds of different stakeholders. For the successful adoption of GenAI, a standard framework is proposed 1) for effective redesign of the course curriculum; 2) for enabling staff and students; and 3) to define an evaluation matrix to measure the effectiveness and success of the adoption process.",

However, the sector’s traditionally conservative stance toward innovation has led to limited research. Thus, this manuscript aims to address this gap by exploring factors influencing the acceptance of GenAI technology innovation among mining industry employees from a developing country perspective. Based on literature reviews seven factors were identified to influence employees’ acceptance of GenAI technological innovation. These factors were examined in a data sample of 286 mining industry employees collected via an office-intercept survey and analyzed with Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) using the SmartPLS software. Through thorough data analysis, models have been constructed that exhibit robustness, evidenced by their strong validity, reliability, and excellent fit with the data. The findings reveal that attitude, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, compatibility, company size, industrial competitiveness, and top management support significantly influence the acceptance of GenAI technology innovation. Notably, attitude was identified as the most influential factor, significantly shaping the likelihood of adoption. Conversely, company size had a comparatively minor impact on acceptance, and the regulatory framework showed no significant effect on the adoption of GenAI technology innovation. These results have important theoretical and managerial implications. Theoretically, they provide a nuanced understanding of the key factors driving technology acceptance in the mining industry, challenging the traditional emphasis on regulatory frameworks. Managerially, they underscore the importance of focusing on factors when developing strategies to foster technological adoption.",

This study aims to determine the capacity of GenAI to generate effective computer programming learning in STEM university students, comparing it with active learning methods based on video. An experiment was conducted with 40 computer engineering students divided into two groups: one using GenAI (Google Gemini 1.5) and another employing educational videos. Pre- and post-tests of knowledge and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) were applied to evaluate learning, intrinsic motivation, and the learning environment. No significant differences in learning were found between the groups. However, GenAI significantly increased perceived autonomy and reduced perceived effort and pressure, while video-based learning significantly improved perceived competence. These findings suggest that both methods seem to motivate in diverse ways and that they could complement each other in an integrated teaching approach, offering new perspectives for designing programming learning environments in higher education.",

    abstract = "Authentic Assessments are generally seen as alternate to traditional assessments though the scope of an authentic assessment is much larger than that of a traditional assessment. Authentic assessments help students in comprehending the subject matter and, if properly designed, can also ensure student workplace readiness. During the authentic assessment design, five most important aspects are considered and their incorporation is sought. These aspects include; the assessment objectives, the physical context of an assessment, the social context, the outcome of the assessment and the assessment criteria. Emergence of the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) supported applications and the Large Language Model (LLM) tools has posed new challenges to the authentic assessment design. Student access to these new applications and tools has also changed the socio-technological realities of the Learning and Teaching (L\&T) practices. Therefore, we need to reimagine both, the L\&T practices and the design and execution of authentic assessments. Keeping the prevailing socio-technological context in perspective, this work in progress paper proposes extending the scope of authentic assessments. The aim is to use them for quelling the growing problem of plagiarism as plagiarism can be facilitated by the use of GAI and LLM tools. Instead of considering authentic assessments as merely ‘an alternate to the traditional examination’ or ‘a tool for evaluating student workplace readiness,’ we propose adding ‘GAI redundancy’ to the scope of authentic assessments. For incorporating GAI redundancy we propose using either the game-based learning environment or a simulation environment. These two environments can be used for generating ‘close to real life’ problem-solving scenarios while assessing student comprehension and workplace readiness. In order to help practitioners, this paper also presents two examples of authentic assessments that were developed for combating plagiarism vis-à-vis enhancing student learning and evaluating their workplace readiness. In the first example, we show how to use a game environment and in the second example we demonstrate use of a simulation environment. The two examples also show how course contents can be embedded and how GAI redundancy can be incorporated in authentic assessments. The reported teaching assessment data and student feedback suggest that the proposed authentic assessment design and implementation strategies were able to engage students, help their comprehension and evaluate their workforce readiness.",

    abstract = "Mobile-edge generation (MEG) is an emerging technology that allows the network to meet the challenging traffic load expectations posed by the rise of generative artificial intelligence (GAI). A novel MEG model is proposed for deploying GAI models on edge servers (ESs) and user equipment (UE) to jointly complete text-to-image generation tasks. In the generation task, the ES and UE will cooperatively generate the image according to the text prompt given by the user. To enable the MEG, a pretrained latent diffusion model (LDM) is invoked to generate the latent feature, and an edge-inferencing MEG protocol is employed for data transmission exchange between the ES and the UE. A compression coding technique is proposed for compressing the latent features to produce seeds. Based on the above seed-enabled MEG model, an image quality optimization problem with energy constraint is formulated. The transmitting power of the seed is dynamically optimized by a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent over the fading channel. The proposed MEG-enabled text-to-image generation system is evaluated in terms of image quality and transmission overhead. The numerical results indicate that, compared to the conventional centralized generation-and-downloading scheme, the symbol number of the transmission of MEG is materially reduced. In addition, the proposed compression coding approach can improve the quality of generated images under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, and the DRL-enabled dynamic power control further improves the image quality under the energy constraint compared to static transmit power control.",

This article reviews the contextual importance and applications of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in the advancement of HSI processing. GAI methods address the inherent challenges of HSI data, such as high dimensionality, noise, and the need to preserve spectral-spatial correlations, rendering them indispensable for modern HSI analysis. Generative neural networks, including generative adversarial networks and denoising diffusion probabilistic models, are highlighted for their superior performance in classification, segmentation, and object identification tasks, often surpassing traditional approaches, such as U-Nets, autoencoders, and deep convolutional neural networks. Diffusion models showed competitive performance in tasks, such as feature extraction and image resolution enhancement, particularly in terms of inference time and computational cost. Transformer architectures combined with attention mechanisms further improved the accuracy of generative methods, particularly for preserving spectral and spatial information in tasks, such as image translation, data augmentation, and data synthesis. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, particularly in developing computationally efficient models for super-resolution and data synthesis. In addition, novel evaluation metrics tailored to the complex nature of HSI data are needed. This review underscores the potential of GAI in addressing these challenges while presenting its current strengths, limitations, and future research directions.",

We focus on the system utility maximization problem, which jointly optimizes transmit power, heterogeneous computing allocation, CPU-cycle frequency, GPU-cycle frequency, and task scheduling under the latency constraint. The optimal CPU-cycle frequency, GPU-cycle frequency, and computing allocation are obtained by employing data parallelism analysis. In particular, we develop a hierarchical soft actor-critic with an intrinsic curiosity (HSAC-IC) algorithm to determine the task scheduling strategy. The HSAC-IC algorithm utilizes a hierarchical strategy structure and an intrinsic curiosity module (ICM) to improve learning efficiency and performance, particularly in environments characterized by sparse rewards, high-dimensional action spaces, and complex tasks. Our simulations benchmark the HSAC-IC algorithm against two existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms and three reference schemes.

However, in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain, distributed and heterogeneous data from end devices lacks contextual relations, which impairs IoT domain GAI training efficiency and leads to inaccurate applications. Nowadays, knowledge graph (KG) offers an effective solution for enhanced performance and interpretability of GAI. Nevertheless, specific data collection and KG creation in IoT scenarios still pose quality and cost challenges for GAI developers. Therefore, designing an effective IoT KG collection and trading strategy is needed to provide reliable knowledge support for IoT GAI from professional data providers. Currently, establishing fair KG pricing, the effective construction of knowledge relations in edge IoT scenarios and preventing data providers from accessing private information remain significant open issues for IoT KG trading. To address these issues, we propose an incentive distributed IoT knowledge market framework to facilitate effective and secure KG trading for IoT GAI. Specifically, first, we design a utility incentive and GAI demand-driven KG pricing strategy, which establishes a three-layer game with trading participants and KG embedding utility function to obtain fair pricing. Second, we devise a smart contract based distributed knowledge aggregation method, which provides collaborative IoT KG relation creation. Third, we propose a privacy-preserving KG construction scheme via homomorphic encryption that achieves consensus of encrypted KG to prevent knowledge providers from accessing IoT privacy. Finally, experimental results of real KG verify the KG-enhanced GAI and proposed market availability.",

Because they operate in complex and dynamic environments, these systems often integrate machine learning (ML)-based components, especially at the perception level. However, high-performance ML solutions require considerable amounts of data, and the resulting models are highly dependent on the training data. These models often leverage hidden patterns, known as dataset bias, that are not related to the concept that is being modeled, which, among other issues, limits the generalization and robustness of the models. Within the perception (images) domain, models trained on a specific dataset often fail to generalize to new datasets, despite the underlying concepts being the same. While various techniques have been proposed, such as diversity strategies, they fail to address the different biases in the data. This paper focuses on the issue of dataset biases for pedestrian classification, a core task for safety-critical autonomous systems. We evaluate the ML model’s generalization on four public reference datasets, along with the use of diversity strategies. To address the dataset biases, we then explore the use of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) techniques. The goal is to allow for the use of multiple large datasets to train a model for a given context, as well as tolerate drifts that might result from changes in the underlying system. Results show a noticeable improvement in the generalization performance of the models, highlighting the potential of such an approach.",

This study employs a questionnaire survey to investigate the current status of autonomous learning among university students in Anhui Province during the AI era. It reveals prevalent issues such as exogenous learning motivation, inefficient strategy execution, and inadequate reflection mechanisms. Based on Zimmerman's Self-Regulated Learning Model, three-stage application strategies are proposed: activating learning interest and establishing personalized learning paths in the forethought stage; recommending intelligent learning resources and adjusting learning strategies in the performance stage; and evaluating autonomous learning effects and reflecting on the learning process in the self-reflection stage. To validate the effectiveness of these strategies, a controlled experiment and qualitative interviews were designed. The research confirms that GAI-enabled application strategies for autonomous learning can provide personalized guidance and support to university students, enhancing their autonomous learning outcomes.",

It is imperative to gain a deeper insight into the mechanisms by which GenAI unlocks environmental performance (EP). To tackle this issue, we propose a novel research framework grounded in resource orchestration theory (ROT). Drawing on survey responses from 260 high-tech manufacturing firms in China, we find that resource orchestration capabilities do not independently mediate the GenAI usage–EP relationship but instead require the support of decarbonization capabilities (DCs) to jointly serve as serial mediators. Moreover, environmental dynamism enhances the mediating effect of DCs in the GenAI usage–EP relationship. Our research elucidates the underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions associated with the use of GenAI to achieve environmental sustainability from the perspective of ROT, contributing to the field of technology-enabled management research.

This research experiments with automatic penetration testing via large language models (LLMs) augmented with security information. This research uses a locally hosted Mistral 7B model with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve penetration testing. When the LLMs are fine tuned with limited and unstructured security data such as privilege escalation articles from a few public web sites, the system succeeds in achieving privilege escalation on Linux hosts. The results of this research suggest that no-cost LLM-assisted penetration testing is possible even on ordinary PCs using locally hosted models.

Rapid advancement in GenAI is giving rise to new potential applications in AEC organizations, and this requires a detailed understanding and a strategic planning technique to evaluate the usefulness of GenAI to organizations. This study aims to address this gap by examining GenAI literature in the AEC industry to determine how GenAI contributes to the enhancement of AEC organizations. To achieve the aim, this article identifies how GenAI is used in AEC organizations, and proposes a strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats (SWOT) process and elements for the strategic evaluation of GenAI in AEC organizations. The research methodology consists of a systematic review process. The findings categorized 79 journal articles and conference papers, which revealed that GenAI was being explored to create architectural and structural designs of buildings, optimize construction processes, and enhance risk management and work safety. There are limitations in the capability of GenAI models to meet project management needs. These include low quality datasets used for training, cost, time, and computation resources required to implement GenAI effectively, and ethics and privacy issues when using GenAI in AEC organizations and projects. Additionally, a SWOT process is proposed, and twenty SWOT elements are developed and described: four elements for strengths, five elements for weaknesses, five elements for opportunities, and six elements for threats. The proposed elements aim at providing a foundation for AEC organizations to assess and achieve their strategic GenAI implementation goals. This article identifies the areas of research focus along with a SWOT process and elements that may be useful to researchers and industry practitioners focusing on GenAI and SWOT in the AEC industry.",

Given the heterogeneity of IoT devices and the variability in data distribution, developing strategies to enhance FL performance without overly burdening resource-constrained devices is crucial. This article proposes an FL algorithm based on generative artificial intelligence (GAI) for IoT devices with extreme heterogeneity in data and resources. The algorithm utilizes pretrained GAI models to generate new data, aligning the data distributions of individual IoT devices closer to independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), thereby effectively reducing the heterogeneity of local data. Additionally, the proposed algorithm incorporates data synthesis and resource scheduling strategies to mitigate the heterogeneity of local device resources. Finally, we formulate a joint optimization problem aimed at minimizing total energy consumption while maximizing FL performance. Experimental results demonstrate that, under significant resource and data distribution disparities, most existing solutions struggle to converge, whereas the proposed method converges and achieves superior performance. Compared to existing GAI-based approaches, our method significantly reduces latency and energy consumption.",

Based on Weber's dual framework of instrumental rationality and value rationality, combined with Strauss's metaphor of the “second cave” the study systematically analyzes the profound impact of instrumental rationality on the essence of education. While generative AI offers significant advantages in enhancing teaching effectiveness, optimizing resource allocation, and achieving personalized learning, its overuse may lead to the prioritization of utilitarian educational goals and the mechanization of knowledge transmission. In response to this contradiction, the study proposes a “teacher-AI-student” triadic interaction model, emphasizing that the application of technology should adhere to the principles of assistive, transparent, and inclusive use. Innovatively, the study constructs a differentiated educational strategy based on the “learning ability-willingness matrix”, providing precise personalized support for different learners. In the process of digital transformation in education, it is crucial to fully leverage technological advantages while steadfastly adhering to the humanistic values, thereby achieving a dynamic balance between instrumental rationality and value rationality.

Unsurprisingly, their application is also attractive to professionals in the research domain, where mundane and laborious tasks, such as literature screening, are commonplace. We evaluate Vertex AI ‘text-bison’, a foundational LLM model, in a real-world academic scenario by replicating parts of a popular systematic review in the information management domain. By comparing the results of a zero-shot LLM-based approach with those of the original study, we gather evidence on the suitability of state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs for the analysis of scientific content. We show that the LLM-based approach delivers good scientific content analysis performance for a general classification problem (ACC =0.9), acceptable performance for a domain-specific classification problem (ACC =0.8) and borderline performance for a text comprehension problem (ACC ≈0.69). We conclude that some content analysis tasks with moderate accuracy requirements may be supported by current LLMs. As the technology will evolve rapidly in the foreseeable future, studies on large corpora, where some inaccuracies are tolerable, or workflows that prepare large data sets for human processing, may increasingly benefit from the capabilities of GenAI.",

We propose a novel approach employing generative artificial intelligence in the context of a learning health system, with an emphasis on inpatient clinical dietetics.

Patient information from electronic health records and clinical dietetics guidelines are incorporated into prompts for MeaIGM, which is refined through nutritionist validations and users' feedback. On the other hand, MealImageGM generates visual representations of meal plans to enhance patient engagement, utilizing crowd-sourced feedback to optimize image generation prompts. The overall system process includes extracting data from electronic health records, pre-designed user meal generation prompts, and the generation of personalized meal plans and images. Nutritionists play a crucial role in monitoring patient adherence and preferences, contributing to a continuous learning health system cycle. The proposed framework ensures clinically appropriate and personalized meal plans, aligning with dynamic dietary recommendations.

We explore the use of LLMS to improve and automate EO analysis, making these results more accessible to a broad range of decision makers. We develop a framework using this technology to support the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) and NASA’s Open Science initiative. This framework leverages current work on Earth observation tools, including the Open Data Cube (ODC) [1] and the OEA Algorithm Hub (AlgoHub). [2]In our work, we investigate the ability of large language models to orchestrate and reason with tools created to access geospatial data using the Open Data Cube and the OEA Algorithm Hub [2]. In this paper we propose a natural language analytical framework for orchestrating Earth observation (EO) analysis. The framework uses large language models to interpret an analysis request, devise a solution based on ODC and AlgoHub tools, and execute the analysis. Our experimental investigations demonstrate that an LLM, with its embedded contextual knowledge, can effectively discern and sequence the necessary processing steps required to fulfill Earth observation analysis requests. This research demonstrates the potential of Generative AI (LLMs) in streamlining and enhancing EO analyses and empowering the observation community.In summary, Generative AI (LLMs) can enhance the capabilities of Earth observation analysis by automating tasks, providing natural language interfaces, and facilitating the extraction of valuable insights from the vast and complex datasets generated by remote sensing and EO technologies.",

However, concurrently fusing texts and images poses significant challenges, often struggling with the maintenance of text accuracy across languages, optimal placement, and appropriate typography. To address these challenges, we introduce the Multilingual Accurate Textual Image Customization (MATIC) framework. MATIC employs the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) concept to decompose the textual image generation process into multiple steps, leveraging diverse generative artificial intelligence, including Multimodal Large Language Model (MMLLM) and diffusion model. The framework first generates the desired text and a corresponding prompt for the diffusion model based on user input. The diffusiongenerated image is then examined to remove any undesired text. Meanwhile, the typographic elements are designed to align with the visual content. Finally, the textual image is fused with the aid of a grid coordinate system, evaluated by MMLLM, and further customized by the user through natural language. Experimental results demonstrate that MATIC can produce accurate, high-quality, multilingual textual images that meet user requirements across various domains, including digital marketing, graphic design, and educational content creation.",

According to the results, most of the AI tools have a limitation in the operations students can perform per day. Only PDFgear offers a no-cost solution with unlimited usage, while some other AI tools allow limited usage for not so high prize. In conclusion, this paper presents a contribution during the documentary analysis of a SLR. It is important to keep in mind the constraints associated with the limited usage of AIs, the accuracy of AI tools, or the complexity of the developed scripts for automating the process. Due to the rapidly changing market for artificial intelligence, the validity of this study is limited to the current state of the tools. Similar studies will be necessary as AI tools continue to evolve.",

At the same time, memories with thematic resemblance can be structured into Schemas using set theory, based on rules influenced by a maturity threshold. This threshold is determined by factors such as criticality, emotional-user interaction, and mass, which is the measure of the summation of related memories. Our approach reconstructs memories into reusable parameters and formulates Schemas, offering a foundation for more personalized and cost-effective human-GAI interactions.",

To address this issue, we have developed a system that analyzes the emotional states of students and then further categorizes them according to their learning pace (fast, medium, or slow). Our system works by first analyzing the survey responses collected from students using a scoring system that is predefined. Then it generates a personalized lesson plan tailored for each student according to the insights gained from the responses. With the integration of OpenAI's GPT-3 for the Lesson plan generation we ensure the content generated will be tailored specifically for each student's needs. Furthermore, it has been observed that using learning strategies that use AI-driven technology can create a more supportive and flexible educational environment which results in the student having better comprehension, motivation and increases academic success.",

However, existing research shows that generative artificial intelligence tools still face multiple obstacles in practical application, such as differences in students' acceptance of new technologies, privacy protection challenges, and difficulties in integrating with the existing education system. This study is based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), a technology acceptance model, and specifically introduces perceived risk as a moderating variable. Combining key factors such as college students' cognitive characteristics and technological environment, this study constructs a theoretical model that affects college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools.The study found that performance expectations, effort expectations, social influence, and convenience conditions have a significant positive impact on college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools; effort expectations have a positive impact on performance expectations; convenience conditions have a positive impact on effort expectations; effort expectations mediate the relationship between convenience conditions and willingness to use; and perceived risk negatively moderates the impact of convenience conditions on willingness to use. It is expected that through this empirical study, the key factors that affect college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools will be deeply explored, and valuable suggestions and references will be provided for guiding technology optimization and education integration practices, which will help develop generative artificial intelligence tools that better meet the needs of college students and promote innovation and improvement of online education models.",

    abstract = "This research work presents a groundbreaking approach at the intersection of neuroscience and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), focusing on the application of neuroscience techniques to neural networks, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs). Central to this study is the concept of ‘neural cluster knockout’ in LLMs, a method inspired by lesion studies in neuroscience involving the systematic removal of neuron clusters to decipher their role within the model. The research underscores the opaque nature of neural networks, particularly LLMs, which are often critiqued for their ‘black box’ operation. By adopting neuroscience principles, particularly lesion studies, this paper aims to illuminate the inner workings of neural networks, enhancing our understanding of their functionalities. This is crucial in an era increasingly reliant on AI in various sectors, where insights from this study could lead to the development of more efficient, transparent, and accountable AI systems. Methodologically, this study involved Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and neural cluster knockout through iterative zeroing, applied to the Large Language Model named LLaMA. This approach enabled the identification of significant neuron clusters and their functional impacts when deactivated. The results reveal both critical and redundant neurons within LLMs, demonstrating that some clusters are vital for accuracy, while others may impede efficiency or contribute to errors. This research contributes significantly to the AI field, offering a novel perspective on the intricate architecture of LLMs. It lays a foundation for future advancements in AI, envisioning refined and efficient LLMs capable of more accurate and reliable performance.",

The conventional feature extraction networks employ fixed-size convolutional kernels, which fail to capture different levels of visual features for targets of varying sizes. In this paper, we propose a mechanism called the 3D-Weight Guide Selective Kernel (3D-WGSK) to jointly utilize spatial and channel information of input features to derive three-dimensional weights. These weights are then employed for convolutional kernel selection, enabling adaptive receptive field acquisition for capturing features of targets with different sizes. We devise a network architecture named the 3D-WGSK Net for feature extraction in remote sensing object detection. It possesses the capability of multi-scale information fusion and adaptive kernel adjustment, effectively extracting crucial features of targets with varying sizes. Experimental results on the publicly available DOTA-v1.5 dataset demonstrate the superior detection performance of our method.",

However, these methods predominantly focus on capturing local features using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), neglecting the comprehensive utilization of global spatial-spectral information. To address this limitation, we innovatively propose a multiscale spatial-spectral CNN-transformer network for hyperspectral image super resolution, namely, MSHSR. MSHSR not only applies the local spatial-spectral characteristics but also innovatively facilitates the collaborative exploration and application of spatial details and spectral data globally. Specifically, we first design a multiscale spatial-spectral fusion module, which integrates dilated-convolution parallel branches and a hybrid spectral attention mechanism to address the strong local correlations in HSIs, effectively capturing and fusing multiscale local spatial-spectral information. Furthermore, in order to fully exploit the global contextual consistency in HSIs, we introduce a sparse spectral transformer module. This module processes the previously obtained local spatial-spectral features, thoroughly exploring the elaborate global interrelationship and long-range dependencies among different spectral bands through a coarse-to-fine strategy. Extensive experimental results on three hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, outperforming comparison methods both in quantitative metrics and visual performance.",

Factors contributing to image blur include atmospheric disturbances during long-range imaging or the orbital motion of remote sensing platforms. The existing methods remove blur in remote sensing images using the traditional attention mechanism, which focuses on a limited number of features. However, they often overlook the features among neighboring positions in blurry areas, and these areas contain more relevant features. Leveraging these features can effectively assist in restoring the complex object textures of remote sensing blurry images. To achieve this, we propose a novel implicit neural attention mechanism for assembling more relevant features implied by surrounding coordinates. Specifically, we use the features and their corresponding coordinates to learn the enhanced feature representation with more relevant features, and this representation can be used to derive the deblurred images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method, INA-RSDeblur, outperforms the state-of-the-art deblurring methods in remote sensing blurry images.",

Essentially, GAI excels not only in content generation but also signal processing, offering support for wireless sensing. Hence, we introduce a novel GAI-assisted human flow detection system (G-HFD). Rigorously, G-HFD first uses the channel state information (CSI) to estimate the velocity and acceleration of propagation path length change of the human induced reflection (HIR). Then, given the strong inference ability of the diffusion model, we propose a unified weighted conditional diffusion model (UW-CDM) to denoise the estimation results, enabling detection of the number of targets. Next, we use the CSI obtained by a uniform linear array with wavelength spacing to estimate the HIR’s time of flight and direction of arrival (DoA). In this process, UW-CDM solves the problem of ambiguous DoA spectrum, ensuring accurate DoA estimation. Finally, through clustering, G-HFD determines the number of subflows and the number of targets in each subflow, i.e., the subflow size. The evaluation based on practical downlink communication signals shows G-HFD’s accuracy of subflow size detection can reach 91\%. This validates its effectiveness and underscores the significant potential of GAI in the context of wireless sensing.",

    abstract = "Students’ decision-making related to attending college for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees and retaining them within those fields continue to be of focus, especially when considering the national goal of satisfying industry, private, and public sector workforce needs. This is particularly important when considering growing national security concerns and ongoing high cybersecurity and climate change workforce demands. However, despite concerted efforts, low enrollment and student attrition continue to be a challenge, even more so since the onset of the global pandemic. Simultaneously, the utilization of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has seen a sharp increase since 2022 by various stakeholders, most notably college students. Additionally, faculty are encouraged by their higher education institutions to incorporate these tools within classrooms for several reasons, including demands from industry for students to gain knowledge and experience with generative AI tools. Given the importance of understanding the ongoing issue of STEM degree attrition and the increasing utilization of generative AI, this research study explored these two areas using ChatGPT, one of the world's most utilized generative AI language models, within the process. The first research question (RQ\#l) is: What is the top reason why students do notfinish college? The response provided solely emphasized finances and/or financial constraints. Based on that answer, the second research question (RQ \#2) was: Is getting a college degree worth the cost? RQ \#2 was explored to allow a deeper understanding of the initial research question from a different angle. Both questions were analyzed through the lens of two theoretical frameworks, the human capital theory and the principal-agent theory, and results were compared to the literature as a form of research validation. This research study is essential as there is an ongoing increase in the utilization of generative AI in homes, K-12 institutions, and higher education for everyday knowledge, formal and informal education. When considering that soon-to-be and current college students may be using these generative AI tools to make decisions related to pursuing and/or retaining their educational status, it is essential to explore how generative AI system outputs align with what has been researched and documented in the literature. Therefore, this research study explored the application of ChatGPT and the system's responses to research questions as a form of document analysis and analyzed those results using triangulation as a form of validation. The analysis and results of this study contributed directly to the recommendations and feedback to the owners of ChatGPT - OpenAI. Additionally, the results highlighted a need for increased focus on AI ethics related to data input, data output, access to the system, and who has a seat at the table as the company recommends, approves, and implements changes. Limitations of this study are provided along with an overarching concluding statement.",

Within the context of online learning platforms, there is a challenge in efficiently and effectively updating course content, which can impact the quality and relevance of the experience. The aim of this pilot was to utilize GenAI to create and augment educational resources, thus improving the clarity, scaffolding, and engagement of the online degree coursework. The methods employed in this pilot study included a quasi-experimental design where a Performance-Based Admissions (PBA) degree course was selected, its content was optimized using GenAI, and the impact was measured using a Difference-in-Differences (DID) analysis comparing optimized and non-optimized courses. The results indicate a 6\% increase in course pass rates and significant improvements in midterm pass rates, average final grades, and the percentage of assignments submitted on time within the optimized course. Given these results, we estimate a 3\% to 13\% positive impact on second term persistence if all first-term courses received a similar GenAI optimization. The impact of this study is significant, demonstrating the potential of GenAI to revolutionize educational practices by providing quickly-produced, high-quality, low-cost content that enhances student learning outcomes. It supports the shift towards student-centered learning approaches and can be particularly beneficial in resource-constrained environments. In conclusion, the study underscores the transformative role of GenAI in education and emphasizes the need for ethical and responsible use to empower students and improve learning outcomes.",

This cognitive ability enhances their grasp of the content and augments their overall enjoyment. Consequently, the development of an automated system aimed at producing visually faithful images based on textual descriptions, often referred to as the text-to-image task, stands as a profoundly meaningful endeavor. For this reason, a variety of text-to-image generating artificial intelligences (AIs) have been devised until now. Nevertheless, the generative AIs introduced thus far encounter an issue wherein they struggle to uphold the coherence of input sentences, particularly when multiple sentences are provided. Within this paper, we present a remedy to this challenge through the application of prompt editing. Furthermore, our experimental results substantiate that our proposed solution more effectively preserves contextual coherence among the generated images in comparison to other preexisting generative artificial intelligence models. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves performance by at least 30 percent in terms of the similarity of the generated image and by 130 percent in terms of $ROUGE\_{recall}$ .",

To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, generative artificial intelligence (GAI)-enhanced multimodal semantic communication (SemCom), referred to as G-MSC, designed to handle various vehicular network tasks by employing suitable analog or digital transmission. GAI presents a promising opportunity to transform the SemCom framework by significantly enhancing semantic encoding, semantic information transmission, and semantic decoding. It optimizes multimodal information fusion at the transmitter, enhances channel robustness during transmission, and mitigates noise interference at the receiver. To validate the effectiveness of the G-MSC framework, we conduct a case study showcasing its performance in vehicular communication networks for predictive tasks. The experimental results show that the design achieves reliable and efficient communication in V2X networks. In the end, we present future research directions of G-MSC.",

To address these challenges, we have proposed a novel distributed traffic flow prediction architecture that makes the integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and hierarchical federated learning.

Challenges with finding meaning have been associated with prolonged grief symptoms that can adversely affect grieving parents’ quality of life. Recently, meaning-centered grief interventions that focus on facilitating adaptive meaning-making after loss have shown therapeutic benefits in reducing prolonged grief symptoms in bereaved individuals. However, these interventions are mostly administered in one-on-one, in-person settings, which limits their accessibility to a broader population due to logistical and locational constraints. While existing videoconferencing applications can provide remote bereavement support and deliver grief therapies, they often lack engaging user experiences and features to support high interactivity, guided imagery and mindfulness exercises commonly used in meaning-centered grief therapies. We hypothesize that the immersive and interactive nature of a networked immersive virtual reality (IVR) system, enhanced with custom content creation features from text-to-image generative artificial intelligence (genAI) models, will create a unique and individualized therapeutic experience that supports meaning-centered grief techniques and activities for bereaved parents in a shared virtual world.

    abstract = "ChatGPT, which has been discussed in public in recent years, was launched in November 2022, with a continuously expanding market size. Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has been developing rapidly in China. However, we have little knowledge of how well the GAIs are performing at answering course-related open questions, especially in Chinese. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the performances of GAIs in answering course-related open questions from both machine and manual evaluation perspectives. The results from this study showed that GAIs got unsatisfactory scores in this situation. Two different aspects of comparison of GAIs’ scores are discussed. More study on evaluating the performance of GAI is needed to investigate the capabilities of answering course-related open questions in the future.",

In this study, we demonstrate a novel application of GenAI for epidemic modeling. We employed GenAI for creating agents living in a hypothetical town in simulations and simulating their behavior within the context of an ongoing pandemic. We performed a series of simulations to quantify the impact of agent traits and the availability of information for health condition, virus, and government guidelines on the disease spread patterns in terms of peak time and epidemic duration. We also characterized the most influential factors in agents' decision-making using random forest model.",

This paper presents a routing protocol for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), incorporating a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The proposed system utilizes BDI-based generative AI models, which rely on predefined logic and rules rather than machine learning to make real-time routing decisions. These decisions are based on data from vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, roadside units (RSUs) and IoT sensors, which integrate traffic density, congestion levels, collision avoidance and hazard detection. The system aims to optimize the accuracy of route selection, energy consumption, and communication latency. The simulation results, implemented using NS3 for real-world traffic scenarios, show improvements in route selection accuracy, collision avoidance, and energy efficiency compared to traditional routing methods. Specifically, the proposed system achieved a route selection accuracy of 95\%, a collision avoidance rate of 95\%, and reduced the communication latency to 105 ms, outperforming the other two methods. Furthermore, energy consumption was minimized and reduced to 85 J per route. These results highlight the potential of BDI-based routing with generative AI to improve ITS performance, particularly in real-time traffic management.",

    abstract = "Communities of Practice (CoPs) groups share knowledge and expertise across disciplinary collectives and industrial sectors. This theoretical construct assumes learning occurs in and across societal contexts where individuals mutually engage in collective, symbolically shared repertoires. Of late, CoPs have been explored regarding the use of technology platforms to enhance learning and to extend symbolically collective learning activities. However, the extensive and recent saturation of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) calls for inquiry into how CoPs understand and adopt this ubiquitous technology discussion relative to shared repertoires. This is especially true given the lack of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) research into GenAI adoption at scale. The present study seeks to uncover how the prominent CoPs of Finance, Art, and Software Development understand GenAI as they discuss their technology adoption practices in online forums. Specifically, more than 2.1 million words of community discussion were examined lexically to reveal the manner by which varied CoPs generate shared repertoires for their community members. Findings indicate that types of practice disciplines relate to the lexical dialectics of Practice/Technology, People/Replacements, and Authenticity/Inauthenticity, as well as insightful discourses regarding what counts as work and adoption. A first for HCI, CoPs, and GenAI research, this study provides additional suggestions for future CoPs symbolically shared repertoires relative to new technologies, as well as how GenAI may be implicated in the adoption, work, and learning-based praxes of heterogeneous disciplinary communities. “Where the artificiality of all that’s being created, the lack of that ‘spark’ that makes an image, a design, even the concept for a product will become so sterile, so overly tasteless that a new culture of ‘human generated content and products’ will become, first a contra-culture, and then a possible rebirth of what really makes our creation unique: That the things we make as humans are our own and nurture us as a species.” “It does not replace programmers, c’mon.

Wireless channels are influenced by many factors, including path loss, reflection, fading, and interference, making them complex and difficult to model and predict. Although some traditional wireless channel modeling methods are effective, they have limitations in handling complex multipath effects and nonlinear characteristics. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has the ability to generate robust data and therefore can be potentially used to model realistic wireless channel characteristics. However, there exist some challenges in GAI for wireless channel modeling, including physical layer network security issues, limited generalization ability, and the bandwidth consumption of centralized training. This article introduces a GAI-based wireless channel modeling framework, which leverages blockchain and federated learning to address efficiency, network security, and data privacy concerns in GAI channel modeling. Blockchain technology, through distributed ledgers and smart contracts, enables resource sharing and efficient utilization, enhancing computational efficiency and reducing network security risks. Federated learning allocates training tasks to different devices and nodes, thus allowing model training without centralizing data, protecting user privacy, and reducing network bandwidth usage. This article demonstrates the performance and effectiveness of the proposed framework through numerical results.",

This technique entails the manipulation of input queries to improve the quality and relation of the textual outputs of these models. New findings point to the fact that through the enhancement of the aspect of prompt engineering it could indeed be a way of significantly boosting LLM performance through a change of the input query format. This paper highlights the practical use of the prompt engineering concept to Tamil-based LLMs with an explicit purpose of developing a well-structured process capable of generating accurate and contextually relevant conversational responses. Thus, with subtle changes to how prompts are offered, this research aims to enhance the efficacy of Tamil LLMs that demand trivial data entry. The research uses the Query Transformation Module (QTM), which is an elaborate method developed to systematically change the input prompts into three forms of inquiries. Therefore, each format is built with objectives and key points in mind to enhance the understanding of the models as well as the results. To measure the effectiveness of this strategy, the QTM was employed with leading Tamil LLMs SKT GPT-2 and Tamil ChatGPT. We employed four different query methods in our experiments: all the initially employed unaltered request and three modified requests according to the QTM. The evaluation was made using Google SSA to fit the evaluation criteria of naturalness and specificity for the sentences generated by the models. Our experimental findings show that overall, there is a reasonable improvement in the performance by an average of 11 percent. Identified that there is an increase of 46\% in the quality of generated sentences when using the transformed queries as compared to the unmodified prompts. This improvement also depicts how the QTM has an effectiveness of enhancing the performance of Tamil LLMs, resulting into its usability as a tool in the corresponding field of prompt engineering.",

Nevertheless, the impact of GAI on students' creativity remains a subject of debate within academia, with no consensus on whether it enhances or undermines creative potential. To address this gap, this study investigated the influence of the generative AI tool Kimi AI on creativity among 113 college students, utilizing a single-factor between-subjects experimental design. Creativity was operationalized through scores obtained from an alien-drawing task, a widely recognized measure of divergent thinking. The results demonstrate that GAI, when employed as a "learning companion," facilitates sustained interaction with students, thereby effectively fostering the development of their creative abilities. As the transition from weak AI to strong AI progresses, a critical challenge in the intelligent era lies in determining how to effectively integrate GAI into educational frameworks to enhance not only creativity but also other core competencies essential for future-ready graduates.},

Fortunately, the recent emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) technology is promising to create high-quality content that can be harnessed to assist knowledge construction in SemCom, enhancing the reasoning ability of semantic coding models. In this letter, we propose a GAI-assisted SemCom framework, named Gen-SC, where sufficient samples for training SemCom transceivers are generated using GAI as per user contextual information. In addition, to guide the GAI model in producing contextually relevant content, a discriminator is incorporated into Gen-SC to measure the disparity between generated samples and actual samples. The simulation results demonstrate that the Gen-SC achieves higher semantic accuracy, especially when the original training samples are insufficient, in contrast to traditional SemCom without knowledge enhancement.",

GAI's growing adoption raises concerns about potential misuse for cyber threats, such as creating, convincing, phishing emails, producing deep fake videos and distributing false information through posts that appear to be genuine on social media. This is accurate even though its potential uses in data synthesis, virtual assistants, content development and the creative arts are exciting. These difficulties appeal for a careful analysis of GAI's place in cybersecurity (CS). This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the possible threats connected to the offensive GAI technique used in the Cyber Kill Chain (CKC) framework. In addition, our proposal includes defense tactics that leverage GAI capabilities. These strategies include the areas of detection, deception and adversarial training, with the aim of reducing the potential risks associated with cyber threats induced by GAI. Threat actors employ the use of GAI to augment Evasion, obfuscation and deception techniques, hence increasing the effectiveness and difficulty of detecting their attacks. This study highlights the importance of using proactive defense measures. The dual capability of GAI for legal and illegal usage highlights the need to comprehend and mitigate its influence inside the CKC framework. To combat the evolving gamut of GAI-induced cyber threats, organizations should employ attack-aware and adaptable GAI-enabled defense strategies.",
