The system integrates advanced artificial intelligence technologies such as GAN and VAE to achieve deep customization and dynamic adjustment of the learning process. First, the GAN model is used to generate personalized learning resources, including courseware, exercises and learning paths, which are dynamically adjusted according to students' knowledge mastery and learning styles. VAE is used to construct a latent space representation of students' learning status and further optimize the personalized recommendation of learning content. To verify the effectiveness of the system, this paper conducted many simulation experiments. By analyzing the learning behavior data of different student groups, the system's performance in personalized recommendation and learning progress adaptation was evaluated. The experimental results show that the personalized learning system based on generative artificial intelligence has significant advantages in improving students' learning effects, shortening learning time, and increasing learning participation. Specific data show that the recommendation accuracy of the system reaches 92\%, the learning efficiency is improved by 15\%, and the student satisfaction is 20\% higher than the traditional learning model.",

In this work, a novel network architecture is presented that integrates the relevant aspects of Ethernet networks and the new GenIA Back End networks. We also deal with aspects related to protocols, bandwidth, design of a GenIA network architecture, components of GenIA networks and cooling systems.

To achieve this, a series of independent variables are defined such as GPU Memory Access, Memory Bandwidth, Throughput, Power Consumption, Temperature, and Clock Speed. With the RBF algorithm, these sub-metrics are analyzed taking into consideration the number of units that may be in each of the hidden layers and the level of importance of the variable, while, with the MLP, the number of units established both in hidden layer 1 and 2, respectively, and the importance level and normalized importance to analyze the behavior of these sub-metrics. The latter is presented through case studies and helps to identify which metrics are more relevant than others in terms of operation, performance, and efficiency of GPU performance metrics.",

The results showed that ChatGPT does not store previous inputs and is not able to reconstruct personal data retroactively if they were not explicitly provided to it in each request. Based on the results obtained, it can be assumed that the use of ChatGPT when processing pseudonymized data does not pose a risk of violating the protection of personal data.

Nevertheless, the assimilation of such immersive technologies necessarily brings with it many challenges, advantages, and risks, which have led to differing opinions among educators, students, and academics. This paper provides a preliminary reflection on the risks and benefits that higher education students perceive in the formal use of this type of tool for academic purposes. An exit survey was used to verify the initial opinions of the students, obtaining almost 90 percent of positive perceptions, but only considering AI as a support tool. In contrast, a significant percentage mentioned that there could be some risks in using this technology: dependency on AI tools, loss of creativity and plagiarism according to institutional policies. Despite its innovative and significant importance, the students acknowledge that the tool is imperfect and accept several disadvantages, such as incorrect answers, poor quality references and the production of unsafe content, so its use must regulate and for now remain only as a complementary support tool.",

In this study, a human-centered learning and teaching framework that uses generative AI tools for self-regulated learning development through domain knowledge learning was proposed to catalyze changes in educational practices. The framework illustrates how generative AI tools can revolutionize educational practices and transform the processes of teaching and learning to become human-centered. It emphasizes the evolving roles of teachers, who increasingly become skillful facilitators and humanistic storytellers who craft differentiated instructions and attempt to develop students’ individualized learning. Drawing upon insights from neuroscience, the framework guides students to employ generative AI tools to augment their attentiveness, stimulate active engagement in learning, receive immediate feedback, and encourage self-reflection. The pedagogical approach is also reimagined; teachers equipped with generative AI tools and AI literacy can refine their teaching strategies to better equip students to meet future challenges. The practical application of the framework is demonstrated in a case study involving the development of Chinese language writing ability among primary students within a K–12 educational context. This article also reports the results of a 60-h development programme for teachers. Specifically, providing in-service teachers with cases involving uses of the proposed framework helped them to better understand the generative AI concepts and integrate them into their teaching and learning and increased their perceived ability to design AI-integrated courses that would enhance students’ attention, engagement, confidence, and satisfaction.",

It identifies and highlights the role of different stakeholders (university management, students, staff, etc.) during the adoption process. It also proposes an objective approach based upon an evaluation matrix to assess the success and outcome of the GenAI adoption. Background: Universities worldwide are debating and struggling with the adoption of GenAI in their curriculum. GenAI has impacted our perspective on traditional methods of academic integrity and the scholarship of teaching, learning, and research. Both the faculty and students are unsure about the approach in the absence of clear guidelines through the administration and regulators. This requires an established framework to define a process and articulate the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder involved. Research Questions: Whether the academic ecosystem requires a methodology to adopt GenAI into its curriculum? A systematic approach for the academic staff to ensure the students’ learning outcomes are met with the adoption of GenAI. How to measure and communicate the adoption of GenAI in the university setup? Methodology: The methodology employed in this study focuses on examining the university education system and assessing the opportunities and challenges related to incorporating GenAI in teaching and learning. Additionally, it identifies a gap and the absence of a comprehensive framework that obstructs the effective integration of GenAI within the academic environment. Findings: The literature survey results indicate the limited or no adoption of GenAI by the university, which further reflects the dilemma in the minds of different stakeholders. For the successful adoption of GenAI, a standard framework is proposed 1) for effective redesign of the course curriculum; 2) for enabling staff and students; and 3) to define an evaluation matrix to measure the effectiveness and success of the adoption process.",

However, the sector’s traditionally conservative stance toward innovation has led to limited research. Thus, this manuscript aims to address this gap by exploring factors influencing the acceptance of GenAI technology innovation among mining industry employees from a developing country perspective. Based on literature reviews seven factors were identified to influence employees’ acceptance of GenAI technological innovation. These factors were examined in a data sample of 286 mining industry employees collected via an office-intercept survey and analyzed with Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) using the SmartPLS software. Through thorough data analysis, models have been constructed that exhibit robustness, evidenced by their strong validity, reliability, and excellent fit with the data. The findings reveal that attitude, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, compatibility, company size, industrial competitiveness, and top management support significantly influence the acceptance of GenAI technology innovation. Notably, attitude was identified as the most influential factor, significantly shaping the likelihood of adoption. Conversely, company size had a comparatively minor impact on acceptance, and the regulatory framework showed no significant effect on the adoption of GenAI technology innovation. These results have important theoretical and managerial implications. Theoretically, they provide a nuanced understanding of the key factors driving technology acceptance in the mining industry, challenging the traditional emphasis on regulatory frameworks. Managerially, they underscore the importance of focusing on factors when developing strategies to foster technological adoption.",

    abstract = "Formative assessment can be a powerful approach in influencing student mathematical motivation, and the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers more possibilities to do so, especially when using feedback for formative assessment. Nonetheless, the literature review of this study found limited development and research on investigating the impact of using generative AI-based formative feedback on student mathematical motivation. Therefore, this study examined the impact of implementing Class Optimization Master, generative AI-based formative feedback software, in promoting student mathematical motivation. The study employed a case study on fourth-grade students in a primary school in China. Semi-structured interviews with 21 students and two teachers were conducted face-to-face. Then, the interview data were analyzed by thematic analysis based on the three-dimensions theoretical framework of Mathematical Motivation Scale: Beliefs, Engagement, and Attitude. This study found that the use of AI-generated formative feedback enhanced student mathematical motivation by (1) boosting confidence, promoting socio-emotional interaction, and raising the importance of mathematics; (2) rewarding and inspiring a preference for mathematics; and (3) stimulating interest and mental-physical effort. These results provide insights for educators to design how to make use of AI-generated formative feedback to promote mathematical learning. It nonetheless calls for more research using quantitative methods and from different perspectives on this topic.",

    abstract = "Authentic Assessments are generally seen as alternate to traditional assessments though the scope of an authentic assessment is much larger than that of a traditional assessment. Authentic assessments help students in comprehending the subject matter and, if properly designed, can also ensure student workplace readiness. During the authentic assessment design, five most important aspects are considered and their incorporation is sought. These aspects include; the assessment objectives, the physical context of an assessment, the social context, the outcome of the assessment and the assessment criteria. Emergence of the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) supported applications and the Large Language Model (LLM) tools has posed new challenges to the authentic assessment design. Student access to these new applications and tools has also changed the socio-technological realities of the Learning and Teaching (L\&T) practices. Therefore, we need to reimagine both, the L\&T practices and the design and execution of authentic assessments. Keeping the prevailing socio-technological context in perspective, this work in progress paper proposes extending the scope of authentic assessments. The aim is to use them for quelling the growing problem of plagiarism as plagiarism can be facilitated by the use of GAI and LLM tools. Instead of considering authentic assessments as merely ‘an alternate to the traditional examination’ or ‘a tool for evaluating student workplace readiness,’ we propose adding ‘GAI redundancy’ to the scope of authentic assessments. For incorporating GAI redundancy we propose using either the game-based learning environment or a simulation environment. These two environments can be used for generating ‘close to real life’ problem-solving scenarios while assessing student comprehension and workplace readiness. In order to help practitioners, this paper also presents two examples of authentic assessments that were developed for combating plagiarism vis-à-vis enhancing student learning and evaluating their workplace readiness. In the first example, we show how to use a game environment and in the second example we demonstrate use of a simulation environment. The two examples also show how course contents can be embedded and how GAI redundancy can be incorporated in authentic assessments. The reported teaching assessment data and student feedback suggest that the proposed authentic assessment design and implementation strategies were able to engage students, help their comprehension and evaluate their workforce readiness.",

This article reviews the contextual importance and applications of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in the advancement of HSI processing. GAI methods address the inherent challenges of HSI data, such as high dimensionality, noise, and the need to preserve spectral-spatial correlations, rendering them indispensable for modern HSI analysis. Generative neural networks, including generative adversarial networks and denoising diffusion probabilistic models, are highlighted for their superior performance in classification, segmentation, and object identification tasks, often surpassing traditional approaches, such as U-Nets, autoencoders, and deep convolutional neural networks. Diffusion models showed competitive performance in tasks, such as feature extraction and image resolution enhancement, particularly in terms of inference time and computational cost. Transformer architectures combined with attention mechanisms further improved the accuracy of generative methods, particularly for preserving spectral and spatial information in tasks, such as image translation, data augmentation, and data synthesis. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, particularly in developing computationally efficient models for super-resolution and data synthesis. In addition, novel evaluation metrics tailored to the complex nature of HSI data are needed. This review underscores the potential of GAI in addressing these challenges while presenting its current strengths, limitations, and future research directions.",

However, integrating GAI with IoT introduces a significant challenge in managing the limited resources of edge networks. In this article, we propose a resource optimization framework for GAI in IoT systems to address this issue, leveraging a heterogeneous computing framework. We focus on the system utility maximization problem, which jointly optimizes transmit power, heterogeneous computing allocation, CPU-cycle frequency, GPU-cycle frequency, and task scheduling under the latency constraint. The optimal CPU-cycle frequency, GPU-cycle frequency, and computing allocation are obtained by employing data parallelism analysis. In particular, we develop a hierarchical soft actor-critic with an intrinsic curiosity (HSAC-IC) algorithm to determine the task scheduling strategy. The HSAC-IC algorithm utilizes a hierarchical strategy structure and an intrinsic curiosity module (ICM) to improve learning efficiency and performance, particularly in environments characterized by sparse rewards, high-dimensional action spaces, and complex tasks. Our simulations benchmark the HSAC-IC algorithm against two existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms and three reference schemes. The results illustrate that our scheme significantly outperforms these alternatives, ensuring AIGC user service requirements, while minimizing service generation costs, and optimizing resource allocation by configuring the image quality strategy on edge servers.",

While AI has previously been employed for basic tasks related to SLRs, such as relevant paper screening and classification within scope, there is still limited research on information retrieval from the full texts of scientific papers. This study focuses on the next phase in the SLR, which involves scientific documentary analysis. The methodology presented in this work compares the AI tools in the market to facilitate scientific documentary analysis and enhance and refine research skills in engineering students. Also, this paper addresses the challenges to automatically run documentary analysis during a SLR. To do so, several techniques to extract information from AIs are presented, including Application Programming Interfaces (API) or Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). According to the results, most of the AI tools have a limitation in the operations students can perform per day. Only PDFgear offers a no-cost solution with unlimited usage, while some other AI tools allow limited usage for not so high prize. In conclusion, this paper presents a contribution during the documentary analysis of a SLR. It is important to keep in mind the constraints associated with the limited usage of AIs, the accuracy of AI tools, or the complexity of the developed scripts for automating the process. Due to the rapidly changing market for artificial intelligence, the validity of this study is limited to the current state of the tools. Similar studies will be necessary as AI tools continue to evolve.",

At the same time, memories with thematic resemblance can be structured into Schemas using set theory, based on rules influenced by a maturity threshold. This threshold is determined by factors such as criticality, emotional-user interaction, and mass, which is the measure of the summation of related memories. Our approach reconstructs memories into reusable parameters and formulates Schemas, offering a foundation for more personalized and cost-effective human-GAI interactions.",

To address this issue, we have developed a system that analyzes the emotional states of students and then further categorizes them according to their learning pace (fast, medium, or slow). Our system works by first analyzing the survey responses collected from students using a scoring system that is predefined. Then it generates a personalized lesson plan tailored for each student according to the insights gained from the responses. With the integration of OpenAI's GPT-3 for the Lesson plan generation we ensure the content generated will be tailored specifically for each student's needs. Furthermore, it has been observed that using learning strategies that use AI-driven technology can create a more supportive and flexible educational environment which results in the student having better comprehension, motivation and increases academic success.",

However, existing research shows that generative artificial intelligence tools still face multiple obstacles in practical application, such as differences in students' acceptance of new technologies, privacy protection challenges, and difficulties in integrating with the existing education system. This study is based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), a technology acceptance model, and specifically introduces perceived risk as a moderating variable. Combining key factors such as college students' cognitive characteristics and technological environment, this study constructs a theoretical model that affects college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools.The study found that performance expectations, effort expectations, social influence, and convenience conditions have a significant positive impact on college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools; effort expectations have a positive impact on performance expectations; convenience conditions have a positive impact on effort expectations; effort expectations mediate the relationship between convenience conditions and willingness to use; and perceived risk negatively moderates the impact of convenience conditions on willingness to use. It is expected that through this empirical study, the key factors that affect college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools will be deeply explored, and valuable suggestions and references will be provided for guiding technology optimization and education integration practices, which will help develop generative artificial intelligence tools that better meet the needs of college students and promote innovation and improvement of online education models.",

    abstract = "This research work presents a groundbreaking approach at the intersection of neuroscience and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), focusing on the application of neuroscience techniques to neural networks, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs). Central to this study is the concept of ‘neural cluster knockout’ in LLMs, a method inspired by lesion studies in neuroscience involving the systematic removal of neuron clusters to decipher their role within the model. The research underscores the opaque nature of neural networks, particularly LLMs, which are often critiqued for their ‘black box’ operation. By adopting neuroscience principles, particularly lesion studies, this paper aims to illuminate the inner workings of neural networks, enhancing our understanding of their functionalities. This is crucial in an era increasingly reliant on AI in various sectors, where insights from this study could lead to the development of more efficient, transparent, and accountable AI systems. Methodologically, this study involved Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and neural cluster knockout through iterative zeroing, applied to the Large Language Model named LLaMA. This approach enabled the identification of significant neuron clusters and their functional impacts when deactivated. The results reveal both critical and redundant neurons within LLMs, demonstrating that some clusters are vital for accuracy, while others may impede efficiency or contribute to errors. This research contributes significantly to the AI field, offering a novel perspective on the intricate architecture of LLMs. It lays a foundation for future advancements in AI, envisioning refined and efficient LLMs capable of more accurate and reliable performance.",

    abstract = "The application of games in the field of education has brought new developments and updated educational needs to games. To maintain and improve students' learning motivation and interest, and more effectively carry out personalized teaching capabilities, research focuses on students' personalized knowledge structure. Starting from tracking the differences in knowledge structures among different learners, a game model based on entrepreneurial education theory has been designed. Through modeling learner knowledge using Bayesian network, the research constructs a game framework of entrepreneurial education for adaptive learning. On this basis, a new feature crossover method is proposed to construct a deep knowledge tracking model based on feature embedding and attention mechanism. It was combined with adaptive learning technology to ultimately construct an entrepreneurial education game model that integrates adaptive learning and improved deep knowledge tracking. A total of 379 students participated in the experiment. The experimental results on the ASSISTments09 open data set show that the area value under the receptivity curve of this model is 0.913, which is 8.8\% to 26.6\% higher than that of advanced models of the same type. The performance of the research model is optimal on different training scale data. Students' adaptability to entrepreneurship education games is higher than classroom teaching, with a difference between 2\% and 11\%. The experimental data demonstrates the high applicability of this research method and also achieves the goal of game design, which has certain practical teaching application value."

    abstract = "ABSTRACT Writing in the digital age has transformed from a mere communicative practice into a computational interface for multimodal creation—establishing a new paradigm where natural language functions as executable code for artificial intelligence systems. This research examines the pedagogical implications of this “Writing is Coding” framework, focusing on how learners navigate cross-media AI co-creation processes. Through a comprehensive three-round experiment, 102 undergraduate students engaged in progressive AI collaboration across textual, visual, and video modalities, using natural language as their primary creative instrument. Employing grounded theory methodology, the researchers analyzed data from student reflection journals, teacher observation logs, and semi-structured interviews to identify emergent patterns in AI-human creative partnerships. Five interconnected themes emerged: (1) prompt engineering as algorithmic thinking, (2) multimodal literacy development, (3) collaborative negotiation of creative agency, (4) emotional engagement through iterative refinement, and (5) metacognitive awareness of human-AI boundaries. Findings suggest that the “Writing is Coding” framework facilitates a deeper understanding of computational processes while enhancing creative expression. The three-round progression demonstrated increasing student comfort with AI collaboration, though tensions around authorship and creative identity persisted. This research contributes to emerging pedagogical approaches that position writing as a form of programming in AI-enhanced learning environments, with implications for curriculum design and digital literacy development."

GAI focuses on creating new textual and multimodal content using large language models (LLMs), and it puts different demands on EFL learners. Although much research has been conducted on EFL learners' AI literacy in various socio-cultural contexts, more attention should now be paid to EFL learners' GAI literacy in the DMC context, a new autonomous model of literacy. It should be noted that even though some studies may concentrate on users' perceptions and experiences with GAI, which may be closely tied to GAI literacy, there lacks the development of a scale for assessing GAI literacy in DMC. Thus, this study attempted to fill these research gaps by developing and validating an applicable and generalizable instrument to measure Chinese EFL learners' multimodal GAI literacy in their DMC process. Two subsamples (n1 = 296, n2 = 294) were randomly invited to respond to the GAIDMCS, and the data were subjected to exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test the validity and reliability of the instrument. The findings suggested that a four-factor solution with 17 items can help explain Chinese EFL learners’ GAI literacy in DMC in terms of affective learning, behavior learning, cognitive learning, and ethical learning. Our GAI literacy in DMC scale may help improve GAI education for researchers and practitioners by providing a comprehensive and plausible framework that can serve as an outline for further syllabus design."

The efficacy of the GAI tool in boosting task performance is still contested and its influence on collaborative knowledge construction remains unclear. Therefore, this study was conducted in an elective course at a university. A total of 30 student teachers were the participants, including 10 groups of 3 students. In the subsequent quasi-experimental study, 5 experimental groups employed the GAI tool and mind mapping based collaborative environment (GMMCE) and 5 control groups employed the conventional mind mapping based collaborative environment (MMCE). The results showed that the experimental groups outperformed the control groups on both collaborative tasks in the course. According to Ordered Network Analysis (ONA), the experimental groups developed a collaborative knowledge construction process in cognitive dimension, i.e., progressive interaction from individual to peer to group. On the contrary, the control groups were mainly reflected in the transition between learners' individual expression and peer interaction since they were more centered on the regulative dimension. We also supplemented students’ perception of using the GAI tool from the interview data.

This study investigates the prevalence of protective-preventive, critical-reflective, and creative-productive GenAI education approaches in highly digitized Swiss upper secondary schools and how students' experiences of these approaches relate to two aspects of their digital agency: GenAI confidence and GenAI responsibility. Using data from 2357 students, the results showed that the critical-reflective approach was the most commonly experienced and significantly predicted students’ GenAI confidence and responsibility. The creative-productive approach positively and significantly predicted GenAI confidence but not responsibility, while the protective-preventive approach, although the second most common approach, was not significantly related to either outcome. However, these approaches explained little variance in the dependent variables, suggesting that they may not yet be effectively implemented or that digital agency is primarily developed outside schools. Analysis of the control variables showed that identifying as a female had a negative significant effect on GenAI confidence and a positive significant effect on GenAI responsibility. The findings highlight the importance of adopting a critical-reflective GenAI education approach with attention to gender issues in fostering responsible and confident digital citizens."

Exploring the relationship between the Scratch project and its remix would provide a new perspective for understanding users’ creative behaviors. To this end, this study used 20 projects and their 957 remixes as samples to analyze creative behavior in Scratch through quantitative statistics and correlation analysis. Three research questions are addressed: (1) What creative levels are there among the remixes? (2) What relationships are there between the project and its remixes? and (3) What creative trends are there indicated in the remixes? The main results are concluded as follows. First, four creative levels of remixes based on the SOLO taxonomy are found, including feature change, appearance change, element creation, and structure creation. Feature change has the highest sum of remixes, which indicates that most remixes are at a low creative level. Second, the internal characteristics of projects are related to the lower creative level of remix, while the external characteristics are attached to the higher creative level of remix. Finally, the two-level, three-level, and four-level iteration chain of remixes are found, in which remixes with high creativity is more likely to inspire remixes with lower or equal creativity. Based on these results, suggestions for further research and improvement are discussed. This study has important implications for understanding the creative level of remix among users in programming community and guiding users to make valuable remixes."

While a growing body of literature reports anecdotal or correlational evidence of GenAI's educational potential, rigorous causal evaluations remain limited. To bridge this gap, this study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental and quasi-experimental studies investigating the effect of GenAI on learning outcomes. Following PRISMA guidelines, we screened five academic databases and identified 68 relevant studies published between 2022 and 2025. These studies yielded a total of 337 effect sizes across various educational levels, subject domains, and instructional contexts. The meta-analysis revealed a moderate overall positive effect of GenAI on learning outcomes (SMD = 0.45, 95 \% CI [0.43, 0.47]), suggesting that GenAI-supported interventions are generally more effective than traditional instruction. However, substantial heterogeneity was observed across studies (I2 = 95 \%), indicating that the magnitude of GenAI's impact varies significantly depending on contextual and methodological factors. Moderator analyses revealed stronger effects in primary and secondary education, within natural science disciplines, and in short-term interventions with smaller sample sizes. These patterns point to both the promise and the complexity of GenAI integration in educational practice. In conclusion, while GenAI shows considerable promise for enhancing learning outcomes, its true potential will only be realized through sustained, efforts to evaluate how, when, and for whom these technologies work best in diverse learning ecosystems."

To uncover the cognitive mechanism underlying the interplay between CT and creativity, we conduct a scoping review of 26 empirical studies published in 2006–2024. Our findings suggested that the effects of working memory varied in the interplay between CT and creativity due to differences in age range, neural network activation regions, and measurements. Intellectual abilities, including algorithmic fluency, reasoning ability, and coding ability, showed cognitive transfer effect on CT skills but not necessarily on creativity, suggesting that cognitive abilities embracing more intelligent elements may contribute to the functional connectivity in CT neural networks but only partly overlapped with creativity involved networks. Although executive functions (working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control) play a crucial role in both CT and creativity, their contributions to the CT-creativity interplay are still rarely studied. Future research should explore the CT-creativity relationship from the perspective of neuroscience."

Traditional human-led methods often face challenges related to cost, scalability, and consistency. For example, distributed questionnaires lack the ability to provide real-time guidance and request immediate clarifications. Recently, various domains have begun to explore the use of conversational agents (chatbots) powered by generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, considering decisions in transportation investments and policies often carry significant socioeconomic and environmental consequences, surveys and interviews face unique challenges in integrating AI agents. This issue underscors the need for a rigorous, explainable, and resource-efficient approach that enhances participant engagement and ensures privacy. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a modular approach accompanied by a parameterized process for designing and deploying AI agents for surveys and interviews, thereby supporting decision-makings in high-stakes contexts. We detail the system architecture, integrating engineered prompts, specialized knowledge bases, and customizable, goal-oriented conversational logic. We demonstrate the adaptability, generalizability, and efficacy of our modular approach through three empirical studies: (1) travel preference surveys, highlighting conditional logic and multimodal (voice, text, and image generation) capabilities; (2) public opinion elicitation on a newly constructed, novel infrastructure project, showcasing question customization and multilingual (English and French) capabilities; and (3) expert consultations about the impact of technologies on future transportation systems, highlighting real-time, clarification request capabilities for open-ended questions, resilience in handling erratic inputs, and efficient transcript postprocessing. The results suggest that the AI agent increases completion rates and response quality. Furthermore, the modular approach demonstrates controllability, flexibility, and robustness while addressing key ethical, privacy, security, and token consumption concerns. We believe this work lays the foundation for next-generation surveys and interviews in transportation research."

The study conducted path analyses on 16,148 secondary school students in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, China in PISA 2022. The results showed that growth mindsets, ICT self-efficacy, and creative environments can directly promote their creative self-efficacy and thinking, while school environments negatively impact creative thinking. Besides, online information practices mediate the relationship between predictors, CSE, and creative thinking. However, ICT feedback and support do not serve as mediators for creative thinking. ICT availability at school positively affects CSE through ICT feedback, while ICT availability outside of school has a negative effect. This study highlights the combined influence of individual traits, behaviors, and external environments on students’ creative thinking, providing valuable insights for educators to take a holistic approach to fostering student development."

As a result of the descriptive analysis, five main themes were identified: critical content production and evaluation, metacognitive skills and self-regulation, ethical thinking and evaluation, analytical thinking and problem solving, motivation and self-efficacy for the AI-assisted writing process and critical literacy skills. Our findings show that students use AI tools not as a simple copy-paste tool, but as a supportive element to develop their thinking. Students question AI outputs, synthesize them with their own ideas and manage their writing processes more consciously. The findings of our study reveal that AI-assisted writing experiences increase students' ethical awareness of originality, academic honesty and creativity, improve their systematic thinking skills in complex writing tasks, and increase their motivation to write. However, the lack of any study at preschool level, the limited number of studies at primary school level, and the scarcity of qualitative studies indicate that more research is needed in this field."

Using a snowball sampling method, this study examined the preparedness, practices, and barriers encountered by 89 U.S. teachers in the state of Idaho. Participants were predominantly White, female teachers serving in rural schools. A mixed-methods analysis of survey responses revealed that teachers were generally underprepared for integrating GenAI, with fewer than half incorporating it into their educational practices. Unlike the widespread classroom integration patterns observed with general educational technologies, teachers in this study tended to use GenAI for out-of-classroom duties (i.e., lesson preparation, assessment, and administrative tasks) rather than for real-time teaching and learning. These preferences could be attributed to key barriers teachers faced, including doubts about GenAI's ability to manage risks (i.e., technology value beliefs), reduced human interaction in instruction (i.e., pedagogical beliefs), ethical considerations, and the absence of policies and guidance. This study highlights the need to develop support systems and targeted policies to facilitate teachers' GenAI integration, offering implications for Idaho's education system and the broader U.S. context."

    abstract = "Background Nursing education increasingly emphasizes academic writing and communication, critical for delivering quality patient care and professional advancement. Rapidly emerging artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot are transforming educational methodologies, and a focus is being placed on embedding AI literacy to effectively bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and clinical practice. These technologies have the potential to reshape nursing education in a technology-driven health-care landscape. Aim This study investigated the effectiveness of AI literacy and the application of ChatGPT and Copilot in academic nursing report writing. It assessed the level of AI literacy of nursing students, examined the integration of basic AI concepts into a curriculum, and analyzed the impact of these tools compared with traditional teaching methods. Methods The study adopted a sample of 203 senior nursing students from Southern Taiwan to compare an AI-enhanced teaching approach using ChatGPT and Copilot with conventional methods. The curriculum, centered on the “Writing Case Reports and Seminars” course, employed the Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate model and incorporated scaffolding techniques to synergistically integrate clinical skills with academic learning. AI literacy was measured using the Meta AI Literacy Scale (MAILS). Summative assessments, adhering to the Taiwan Nursing Association standards, focused on individual and group case report evaluations. Findings Following an 18-week AI intervention, the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in all dimensions of the MAILS. A ChatGPT usage of 100 \% was found, with a notable enhancement discovered in the “Nursing Plan” section of case reports. Although the experimental group outperformed the control group in overall case report evaluations, the connections between identified problems and proposed plans were weaker and nursing interventions tended to be less individualized for the experimental group. Conclusions The incorporation of AI tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot into a scaffolding teaching framework significantly boosted students' AI literacy and performance in summative assessments. Effective AI training for students, supervised use of these tools, and continuous professional development for educators are paramount to successful implementation. Addressing the current limitations of AI has the potential to further improve academic writing, foster critical thinking, and ensure responsible application in patient care, ultimately leading to higher-quality and more effective nursing education."

    abstract = "While Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) platforms like ChatGPT have gained significant traction in education, their specific applications for neurodivergent learners remain largely unmapped. Through systematic searching of academic databases and grey literature between 2020 and 2024, this scoping literature review examined the emerging landscape of GenAI applications in supporting neurodivergent students (e.g., those with ADHD, autism, dyslexia, gifted, twice-exceptional) within K-12 educational contexts. Twenty-one relevant sources were identified, discussing GenAI usage with neurodivergent students, the analysis revealed discussion of several predominant applications, including personalized learning, administrative assistance for educators, and development of individualized education plans. The review identified both promising approaches and significant concerns. Benefits included GenAI's potential to provide real-time, personalized support for students as well as reducing administrative burdens for educators. However, notable concerns emerged regarding information accuracy, over-reliance on AI, privacy considerations, and the need for human oversight. The limited empirical evidence base was particularly striking, with only nine studies providing original research data. The review identified critical gaps in current understanding, particularly regarding GenAI's effectiveness across different neurodivergent conditions and curriculum areas, and little evidence of approaches detailed in ways that educators could use. This scoping review demonstrates the need for robust empirical research examining GenAI usage in learning for neurodivergent students. These insights are timely and crucial for educators, researchers, and policymakers working to harness GenAI's potential in supporting neurodivergent learners within inclusive educational environments."

This study examines the gender divide in CIL and CT among adolescents in four European countries, highlighting the gender-based disparities in digital literacy development. Based on ICILS 2018 data, this research identifies factors contributing to gender divides in CIL and CT using regression and decomposition methods. Findings indicate that females outperform males in CIL, while males excel in CT. Gender divides decrease as the percentiles of students’ proficiency levels increase. The explained portion of the gender divide in CIL and CT is consistently smaller than the unexplained portion across countries, suggesting that gender divide or unobserved factors may drive these divides. A comparison of OLS regression results with decomposition approaches indicates that the factors influencing digital literacy development differ from those contributing to the gender divide. Variation in the factors contributing to gender divides is greater across countries than within countries for both CIL and CT. These findings highlight the need to consider national digital environments and socio-cultural contexts in addressing gender divides in digital literacy. This study offers insights for policymakers and educators to address the gender divide in digital literacy."

This study examines the acceptance of the use of GenAI tools for teaching and learning among primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong. It uses an extension of the technology acceptance model (TAM) with a modified framework that incorporates two key factors: self-efficacy and subjective norm. Data were collected from a sample of 367 primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong using questionnaires containing items for six constructs: self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude towards using, subjective norm, and behavioural intention. The results show that fostering teachers' self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, and attitude is essential for successfully increasing their behavioural intention to use GenAI tools. Subjective norm was also found to influence teachers' behavioural intention. To enhance teachers' effective use of GenAI for teaching, teacher development programmes should focus on equipping teachers with comprehensive conceptual knowledge and skills and an understanding of the application of these tools to teaching and learning. Policy support to create a conducive environment for the use of GenAI in teaching and learning would also be beneficial. The study has theoretical implications in its extension of the TAM model as well as implications for enhancing teachers’ AI literacy and developing pedagogies for the meaningful use of GenAI tools for teaching and learning in K–12 settings."

While the findings highlight GenAI's potential to support constructivist active learning, its application remains largely individual in scope. Moreover, challenges related to algorithmic bias, information reliability, privacy, and limited domain specificity constrain the orchestration of synergistic human-GenAI interaction, placing significant pedagogical demands on both educators and learners when interacting with GenAI-powered applications. Future research should explore how human-GenAI interactions can be orchestrated to support more active, collaborative, and context-sensitive learning environments. This includes supporting students in developing the competencies necessary to engage, individually and collaboratively, with GenAI tools reflectively, purposefully, and meaningfully in ways that enhance active learning."

This paper presents the AIware Competency Model, a comprehensive framework of 98 AI-related competencies designed for K–12 education, including emerging aspects of GAI. The model was developed using an Action Design Research (ADR) approach, structured across four iterative stages: (1) a systematic literature review and analysis of 14 existing AI competency models to identify conceptual gaps; (2) semi-structured interviews with AI experts and educators (n = 5) to inform initial model development; (3) three rounds of focus groups involving teachers, policymakers, and AI professionals (total n = 46) to refine and evaluate the competencies; and (4) a competency ranking process (n = 10) to assess perceived importance across educational roles. The AIware Competency Model addresses current fragmentation in AI education research by offering a unified, empirically grounded framework aligned with practical classroom needs. It enables mapping to existing curriculum standards and supports both teacher preparation and student readiness in a world increasingly shaped by AI. The model contributes to the field by combining theoretical synthesis with practitioner input, offering a robust foundation for future research, curriculum design, and policy development."

Although human-generative AI (GenAI) collaborative programming learning might have the potential to enhance personalized programming education, GenAI's interplay with SRL processes remains underexplored. To address this gap, this study first proposed a SRL Behavior Analysis Framework for human-GenAI collaborative programming learning environments and then examined SRL behaviors of a group of sixth-grade students (n = 36) in such an environment using this framework, along with various learning analytics methods including cluster analysis, descriptive statistics and lag sequential analysis. The analysis yielded the following results: (1) Based on their learning performance, primary school students were identified as three distinct clusters: programming specialized unit (PSU), high performance unit (HPU), and low performance unit (LPU). (2) Regarding SRL behaviors, students prioritized self-control (65.8 \%), followed by self-observation (19 \%), task analysis (12.1 \%), and behavior stagnation (3.2 \%). (3) Students in PSU and HPU consistently adopted goal-oriented SRL strategies, whereas students in LPU exhibited passive dependence and fragmented strategy use. GenAI's facilitative effect in supporting learning correlated with users' SRL capabilities. (4) Students in PSU and HPU exhibited frequent transitions between SRL behaviors, whereas students in LPU had insufficient ability to switch strategies when facing programming difficulties. Based on these findings, this study proposed four forward-looking design recommendations: effectively integrating GenAI with the programming environment, utilizing multimodal data and AI for learning assessment and feedback, building a cluster-driven early warning mechanism, and conducting dynamic SRL analysis and guidance based on fine-grained time-series data."

While digital storytelling (DST) has shown promise in fostering reflective practice, traditional methods often present technical barriers that hinder deeper reflection. Few studies have explored how generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools can support RTS during DST creation. This study addresses these gaps by adopting a three-dimensional framework of RTS, which included the time of reflection, objects of reflection, and levels of reflection, to guide and assess the impact of GAI-assisted DST creation on pre-service teachers' reflective patterns. Employing a post-test quasi-experimental design, eighty pre-service teachers were divided into two groups: an experimental group utilizing GAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Midjourney, Runway) for DST creation, and a control group utilizing traditional methods. Results revealed that the experimental group significantly improved RTS in time, objects, and levels of reflection. Pre-service teachers in the experimental group reflected more on problem definition and solution generation during the design stages of reflection time. Regarding reflection objects, the experimental group exhibited significantly higher reflection frequencies across self, artifacts, and circumstances aspects. Additionally, pre-service teachers in experimental group demonstrated significantly higher reflection frequencies at all levels—single-loop, double-loop, and triple-loop—compared to the control group. Single-loop reflection was the most common, while triple-loop reflection was the least frequent in both groups. These findings underline GAI's potential to scaffold RTS and enhance the DST creation process, offering valuable insights for integrating GAI into teacher education to foster deeper reflective practice."

While cross-sectional studies have highlighted correlations between ChatGPT use and learning performance, they fall short of establishing causality. This review examines experimental studies on ChatGPT's impact on student learning to address this gap. A comprehensive search across five databases identified 69 articles published between 2022 and 2024 for analysis. The findings reveal that ChatGPT interventions are predominantly implemented at the university level, cover various subject areas focusing on language education, are integrated into classroom environments as part of regular educational practices, and primarily involve direct student use of ChatGPT. Overall, ChatGPT improves academic performance, affective-motivational states, and higher-order thinking propensities; it reduces mental effort and has no significant effect on self-efficacy. However, methodological limitations, such as the lack of power analysis and concerns regarding post-intervention assessments, warrant cautious interpretation of results. This review presents four propositions from the findings: (1) distinguish between the quality of ChatGPT outputs and the positive effects of interventions on academic performance by shifting from well-defined problems in post-intervention assessments to more complex, project-based assessments that require skill demonstration, adopting proctored assessments, or incorporating metrics such as originality alongside quality; (2) evaluate long-term impacts to determine whether the positive effects on affective-motivational states are sustained or merely owing to novelty effect; (3) prioritise objective measures to complement subjective assessments of higher-order thinking; and (4) use power analysis to determine adequate sample sizes to avoid Type II errors and provide reliable effect size estimates. This review provides valuable insights for researchers, instructors, and policymakers evaluating the effectiveness of generative AI integration in educational practice."

Top themes include ‘Natural Language Model’, ‘Semantics’, and ‘Human’. Topmost publishers were Applied Sciences (Switzerland), IEEE Access and PLOS ONE with top average citations by Sensors (12.67 citations/publication). The study confirms Bradford and Price laws. ERNIE Bot's application in education has attracted notable attention, with 22.4 \% of the analyzed studies focusing on this area, highlighting its strong potential in personalized learning and human-computer interaction. Findings from discourse analysis shows that it’s Chinese origin is often framed as a symbol of contextual leadership and basis for positioning ERNIE Bot as a key player in China's technological competition with global models like ChatGPT. ERNIE Bot's strengths in Chinese language processing and innovations are also highlighted regarding power relations and knowledge hierarchies. However, ERNIE Bot lags global counterparts in overall competitiveness; limitations in data diversity, political censorship, and accessibility further restricts its global applicability.

To address this gap, our study aimed to develop and validate a GenAI literacy scale for the Chinese EFL context, involving 603 EFL teachers. Specifically, a tentative scale comprising 38 five-point Likert items was administered to participants. Through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), the final scale was refined, evincing 32 items categorized into five dimensions: “GenAI Knowledge”, “GenAI Use”, “GenAI Evaluation”, “GenAI Design”, and “GenAI Ethics”. Moreover, statistical analysis also verified the scale's convergent validity and reliability in measuring the construct of GenAI literacy. We anticipate that this EFL teachers' GenAI literacy scale will guide teachers and teacher educators in enhancing GenAI capabilities for professional growth.

Specifically, we propose a formal model of hybrid creative process designed to maximize the synergistic potential of the human-GenAI interaction. Drawing on machine learning literature, we conceptualize GenAI as a superposition of latent entities. Through formal argumentation, we demonstrate that optimal creative outcomes arise when human agents actively select the most appropriate entity from the complete spectrum of potential alternatives for the problem at hand. Finally, we outline the ideal iterative process required to asymptotically converge toward these optimal entities. Beyond its practical utility for managers, our model provides new insights into human-GenAI mutual augmentation, the nature of creativity, and the skills and cognitive properties involved."

However, there is a lack of understanding of how to use and integrate AR in real makerspace environments. In this research we use a co-design methodology to address the following questions: (1) How can AR be useful for education in makerspaces? (2) How are students impacted by the process of co-designing AR technology? and (3) What are practical considerations for integrating AR in makerspaces? We engaged in a co-design process in a semester-long makerspace course attended by 18 students in a graduate school of education. Through this process, we generated six prototypes with seven student co-designers, exploring AR use in design, fabrication, programming, electronics, and training. We also identified areas where AR technology can benefit makerspaces, such as teaching STEM skills, facilitating construction activities, enhancing contextualization of learning, and debugging. We observed that students participating in co-design demonstrated improved understanding of technology design, enthusiasm for engaging with makerspaces and AR, and increased critical thinking about AR technology.

    abstract = {The idea that learning and creativity are interrelated has experienced a renaissance in the last 20 years. Fashionable and suggestive, the concept of "creative learning" has found traction in educational policy and in progressive classrooms across the globe. This configurative review explores how the concept of creative learning has been understood and put into practice across 112 education studies since 2010. Specifically, the review addresses two questions: First, what are the constitutive features and actions that characterize creative learning? Second, what are the overarching themes that can be identified in the literature? The study reports on the findings of an extensive thematic analysis, which indicated four general approaches to creative learning: namely (1) creative agency over learning, (2) affective and embodied pathways, (3) relational ecologies, and (4) learning by doing and making. The review concludes with a discussion of each of these themes, deriving from them a set of practical recommendations and a revised definition of creative learning.}

Adversarial training methods were used in video processing to optimize the generated model, enabling it to map between different styles and achieve style transfer. The generative adversarial network was optimized using a cyclic consistency loss function to ensure consistency of video content before and after editing. Based on the trained recurrent generative adversarial network, style transformation and content editing on the video were performed.

    abstract = "The manufacturing sector is in a challenging spot. Confronted with persistent cost pressures, supply chain instability, and disruptive technologies like as 3D printing and the Internet of Things. The industry must consistently optimise processes, enhance efficiency, and improve overall equipment performance. Simultaneously, there is a significant surge in sustainability and energy transition. Manufacturers are being urged to decrease their carbon emissions, embrace circular economy principles, and enhance their overall environmental sustainability. Manufacturers are under pressure to consistently innovate while still assuring stability and safety. An erroneous AI forecast in a marketing campaign may cause small inconvenience, whereas an erroneous AI forecast on a manufacturing shopfloor can have catastrophic consequences. Manufacturers are familiar with technology and disruption, but the main issue is that what is effective in principle often proves unsuccessful in practice. As producers, we have established a knowledge base; nevertheless, it is difficult for users to locate information efficiently as it requires extensive time and effort to search and navigate through the contents. Alternatively, we can establish a data lake that may rapidly deteriorate into a data swamp. Alternatively, we can continue to incorporate other applications, so perpetuating the growth of our technological debt. However, we are now incapable of updating our applications due to the presence of intricate and long-standing logic within them. The implementation requirements and applications of generative artificial intelligence differ from those of analytical AI. Analytical artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used for the purposes of predicting future events, optimising desired values, and utilising past data to enhance processes and results. Gen AI represents a new opportunity for problem solutions, as demonstrated by recent advancements in content production, insight generation, and human-like engagement. There is an urgent need for additional scholarly research to gain a deeper understanding of how Gen-AI technologies are being adopted and spread across different industries in production systems. This study represents a preliminary attempt to investigate the current utilisation of Gen-AI by corporations, as well as the advantages and difficulties it entails, and the anticipated future of these technologies.",

    abstract = "Since the introduction of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), education in computer science has prompted efforts to incorporate it into the educational curriculum. This innovative practice full paper presents a study into using GenAI to enhance student learning of software engineering. It outlines the initiatives to introduce GenAI into a graduate-level software engineering course in Software Verification and Validation (SV\&V). The paper presents the educational goals, methodologies and findings of these endeavors in this course. The primary education goal of this course is that students have a solid understanding of principles and practices of software quality assurance and seek to introduce students to diverse techniques employed for SV\&V. The study presented in this paper centers on the practical application of GenAI within the domain of testing strategies. The paper introduces the findings of an exercise where GenAI was used to apply testing strategies for unit testing. The exercise consisted of the use of GenAI in the development of unit tests for an algorithm. Rigorous assessments were conducted to gauge the effectiveness of the unit tests developed for validating the accurate implementation of the algorithm. This exploration shed light on the tangible impact of GenAI on the precision and efficiency of unit testing procedures. The findings underscore the significance of encouraging students to actively explore emerging trends and methodologies in the realm of software verification and validation. By incorporating GenAI into the educational framework, students not only gain insights into the capabilities and limitations of this technology but also foster a mindset of continuous learning in software quality assurance. The paper demonstrates that it is not sufficient to use the test cases developed by GenAI for software validation since test cases recommended by GenAI do not cover corner cases which causes gaps in coverage in unit testing. The majority of the students were able to understand the limitation of GenAI in SV\&V but appreciated its support in suggesting test cases for the most common cases. This exercise allowed students to enhance their creative problem-solving through human-guided AI partnership which is pivotal in cultivating a new generation of professionals capable of contributing to the ongoing evolution of software quality.",

In the Green Phase, the TDD developer writes production code to make the test pass as quickly as possible. Finally, in the refactor phase, the TDD developer “cleans” written code. In this demo paper, we present GAI4-TDD (Generative Artificial Intelligence for Test-Driven Development), a PyCharm plugin to support the Green Phase of TDD. Specifically, this plugin generates production code from the tests the TDD developer had written in the Red Phase so that the generated code makes these tests pass. Previous studies have shown that TDD can be beneficial not only in the “traditional” software development context but also in the Embedded Systems (ESs) development context. We preliminary assessed GAI4-TDD in the latter context through a laboratory empirical study on three ESs. We observed that in the greater part of the cases, GAI4- TDD generates production code that successfully implements the chunk of functionality required.

The generative AI uses a diffusion model and incorporates a transformer model to output a series of innovative and practical antenna structures according to the input antenna requirements. To select the optimal structure from a large set of candidates, we further incorporate the Characteristic Mode Analysis (CMA) method into the Bilinear Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNN) model for evaluation and selection. The antenna inverse design scheme cleverly combines AI with the CMA method, which greatly simplifies the tedious process of traditional antenna design. By simply inputting the antenna requirements, the optimal antenna structure, distinct from existing datasets, can be rapidly obtained. Since the output is an antenna structure, it is not limited to a specific frequency band, thus offering design flexibility for cross-band adjustments. This letter presents case studies on single-band, dual-band, and wideband circularly polarized microstrip antennas to validate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

The former enables immersive, spatially accurate reconstructions of historical environments, while the latter provides tools such as text-to-image and text-to-3D generation which let us dynamically render visual elements quoted in literary texts.

The algorithm effectively integrates multimodal cultural data such as text, image, and audio by constructing a cultural feature fusion module, a dynamic adversarial training mechanism, and a semantic consistency constraint module. The experiment uses public cultural data sets and self-built characteristic cultural corpora, covering scenes such as poetry creation, film and television poster design, and music melody generation. In the poetry generation task, the BLEU-4 score of poetry generated by MM-GAN reached 0.45, which is higher than the 0.32 of traditional GAN and other baseline models. In the film and television poster design experiment, the average perceptual similarity between the generated poster and the target style is 0.88, far exceeding the comparison algorithm. In terms of music melody generation, the average harmonic rationality score of the generated melody is 4.2 (out of 5 points). The results show that MM-GAN is significantly superior to traditional algorithms in terms of cultural creation quality, style fit and semantic coherence, and can effectively assist cultural creation and dissemination, providing a new path for the development of this field.",

Traditional semantic communication systems have some limitations in conveying semantic information in a dynamic environment, but generative artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to break through this bottleneck with its ability of context understanding and data generation. This paper proposes GenAI-SC, a generative semantic communication architecture that utilizes large-scale pre-training models for semantic information extraction and adopts a diffusion model as its core. The architecture extracts and compresses semantic information through large-scale models and utilizes diffusion models to achieve high-quality image recovery, which is especially suitable for complex communication environments. To verify the effectiveness of this architecture, this paper design two task modes, plain text diffusion image generation and text-image joint diffusion generation, to flexibly cope with different transmission tasks. The experimental results show that GenAI-SC performs well under different channel conditions and inference steps, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio environment, showing that GenAI-SC has good multitasking capability and communication robustness.

The current model of periodic patient visits with standard dialogue responses fails to adequately address the individualized needs of patients and caregivers. This lack of personalized guidance undermines treatment adherence and satisfaction. To bridge this gap, we developed a novel approach leveraging generative AI (GAI) to optimize patient-manager interactions. Focusing on prevalent chronic conditions such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and dementia, we created intelligent dialogue agents that deliver tailored, actionable nursing recommendations aligning with each case's unique circumstances. The developed methodology began by curating a corpus of 30 frequently asked questions on home care, emotional support, and social factors from online patient data across the three diseases. We employed prompt engineering to precisely define the virtual roles of nurses and physicians while implementing a “Rephrase and Respond” (RAR) protocol to enhance query comprehension and generate reliable solutions. The RAR approach solves problems by question restating, followed by contextualized recommendations from the language model. Clinical expert feedback iteratively refined the system's outputs. The evaluation result showed an average gain of 10\% in response and an increase of 5\% in readability after optimization. The optimized RAR method of large language models effectively improved the quality of nursing advice for chronic disease, aligned with patients' emotional and social needs. The RAR method in medical advisory areas, including chronic disease management and rehabilitation care, enhances the quality and practicality of nursing advice in these domains.",

However, their inherently contradictory characteristics present significant challenges to direct knowledge sharing. Furthermore, conventional methods that independently optimize fine-tuning and inference lack the foresight to achieve long-term network benefits. To address these challenges, we propose the GAI-oriented synthetic network (GaisNet), a collaborative cloud-edge-end intelligence framework that integrates fine-tuning and inference. GaisNet, specifically, can mitigate contradictions by leveraging data-free knowledge relays, where bidirectional knowledge flow facilitates a virtuous cycle of model fine-tuning and task inference with a long-term perspective, fostering mutualism between GAI and EI in the IIoV. A case study illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the future challenges and directions in the interplay between GAI and EI.",

The data, information, knowledge, and work (DIKW) hierarchy is a useful framework for teaching and for checking metacognitive and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) literacy.

The combined intelligence model is a method of using GAI for creating works by collecting data, organizing information, and deriving knowledge from information. This model is suitable for GAI-assisted tasks (GAIATs). The parallel intelligence model is suitable for GAI-assisted learning (GAIAL); it is a method in which a person develops abilities by analyzing and comparing tasks created by GAI after going through the data-information-knowledge-work process.

This research aims to construct a Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) tutor that implements personalized learning and teaching in a higher education level course. The research methodology involved exploring literature to determine the requirements for personalized learning and designing a tutor system. The resultant system uses Custom GPT technology, Application Programming Interface (API), a repository for storing content, learners' profile information, and performance metrics. Out of the six components that make the proposed system, only the “Custom GPT” component has been implemented and tested on a course named “Applied Cryptography” in a postgraduate program. Though the preliminary results are promising, an effective assessment of the system will be made when the full implementation is completed. Further, issues related to ethics, scaling and integration with learning management systems should also be considered. Subsequent work to this study will focus on those issues.",

Analysis is interpreting data and involves drawing conclusions based on the information gathered. Medical Image Analysis aims to extract insights using various computational techniques. This process includes exploring, manipulating, visualizing, segmenting, classifying, and registering both 2D and 3D images. In addition, it encompasses reconstructing image data from medical imaging tools, like X\&\#x2010;rays, ultrasounds, CT scans, MRIs, PET scans (positron emission tomography), SPECT scans (single photon emission computed tomography), and microscopy. The motto is to generate visual representations of internal body parts for medical and clinical assessments. This analysis is required for automating operations of healthcare like cell counting, detecting anomalies like cancerous cells, segmenting tumor tissues, measuring oxygen saturation, and reconstructing 3D representations for diagnostic and treatment planning. These days, high\&\#x2010;end computing is necessary for many medical image processing and analysis techniques in order to minimize the requisite runtime. This review's primary goal is to offer a comprehensive reference for medical image analysis and morphological methods that have recently benefited from high\&\#x2010;performance computing technologies.</p> <p>Now, let us understand the term morphology; it is an inspection of an organism's form, structure, and unique structural characteristics. Here, we go over some of its features and introduce the fundamental morphological transformations. We also provide a synopsis of the morphological filtering theory.

The goal is to build a general-purpose prediction engine that can automatically generate predictions from tabular data with minimal or no more training data. Although LLMs excel at text generation, they struggle with business-related data that is tabular and has challenges with categorisation, regression, and prediction. In fact, the SAP Foundation Model can compete with and even surpass these conventional methods while providing the flexibility of foundation models; in contrast, state-of-the-art LLMs perform 20-50\% worse than incumbent restricted AI approaches in comparable cases. SAP has a long track record of successfully meeting business needs, and the company's stated goal is to develop AI that is useful, trustworthy, and socially conscious so that it can assist clients in solving their business challenges. Another innovative strategy for AI development, federated learning is quickly becoming the standard for delivering AI apps to the periphery of industrial networks. Research into the development of ethical guidelines and frameworks for the deployment of AI in MIS should prioritize the safety and security of data. In order to reap the benefits of AI integration for businesses, one must first establish a cohesive digital business plan. Another is getting people to interact with AI despite obstacles.",

The results reveal students predominantly emphasized the components of “Focus” and “Verb” while displaying comparatively less attention to the other components. Through cluster analysis, the study categorizes students' prompts into five patterns, each reflecting different component strategies in prompt engineering.

This study aims to explore the generative AI academic research in the past decade using bibliometrics, text analysis, and social network analysis. Specifically, research themes and their relationships, the evolution of research themes over time, and prominent authors, articles, journals, institutions, and countries publishing in generative AI are identified. The data was further found to partially support the classical bibliometrics laws of Zipf, and Bradford’s. The two overarching research themes identified using knowledge synthesis from most cited articles and journals are technical advancements and developments in generative AI systems; and their applications to image processing, pattern recognition, and computer vision. ChatGPT, large language models, and the application of generative AI to healthcare and education are emerging research topics. Additionally, generative AI’s usefulness to geoscience, remote sensing, Internet of Things (IoT), and cybersecurity are discussed.",

A novel MEG model is proposed for deploying GAI models on edge servers (ESs) and user equipment (UE) to jointly complete text-to-image generation tasks. In the generation task, the ES and UE will cooperatively generate the image according to the text prompt given by the user. To enable the MEG, a pretrained latent diffusion model (LDM) is invoked to generate the latent feature, and an edge-inferencing MEG protocol is employed for data transmission exchange between the ES and the UE. A compression coding technique is proposed for compressing the latent features to produce seeds. Based on the above seed-enabled MEG model, an image quality optimization problem with energy constraint is formulated. The transmitting power of the seed is dynamically optimized by a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent over the fading channel. The proposed MEG-enabled text-to-image generation system is evaluated in terms of image quality and transmission overhead. The numerical results indicate that, compared to the conventional centralized generation-and-downloading scheme, the symbol number of the transmission of MEG is materially reduced. In addition, the proposed compression coding approach can improve the quality of generated images under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, and the DRL-enabled dynamic power control further improves the image quality under the energy constraint compared to static transmit power control.",

To carry out this transition process, it will be necessary to develop clear guidelines that adhere to integrity standards and ethical codes of higher education institutions. In addition to offering responses to a number of research questions, the purpose of this study is to further the current discourse surrounding the moral guidelines for GAI in higher education. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) technique and Bibliometric Analysis using VOSviewer, 37 related research studies were reviewed and evaluated. The results demonstrate that the number of articles published has been increasing over time, with the largest number of scientific publications occurring in 2024. This can be explained by the fact that, despite the fact that GAI offers benefits and drawbacks for the educational sector, particularly for higher education, it also makes clear how important it is for professionals and organizations to use GAI tools in order to handle ethical issues by continuously developing policies. By creating norms and policies, future ethical problems with GAI in education may be more accurately predicted.

However, in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain, distributed and heterogeneous data from end devices lacks contextual relations, which impairs IoT domain GAI training efficiency and leads to inaccurate applications. Nowadays, knowledge graph (KG) offers an effective solution for enhanced performance and interpretability of GAI. Nevertheless, specific data collection and KG creation in IoT scenarios still pose quality and cost challenges for GAI developers. Therefore, designing an effective IoT KG collection and trading strategy is needed to provide reliable knowledge support for IoT GAI from professional data providers. Currently, establishing fair KG pricing, the effective construction of knowledge relations in edge IoT scenarios and preventing data providers from accessing private information remain significant open issues for IoT KG trading. To address these issues, we propose an incentive distributed IoT knowledge market framework to facilitate effective and secure KG trading for IoT GAI. Specifically, first, we design a utility incentive and GAI demand-driven KG pricing strategy, which establishes a three-layer game with trading participants and KG embedding utility function to obtain fair pricing. Second, we devise a smart contract based distributed knowledge aggregation method, which provides collaborative IoT KG relation creation. Third, we propose a privacy-preserving KG construction scheme via homomorphic encryption that achieves consensus of encrypted KG to prevent knowledge providers from accessing IoT privacy. Finally, experimental results of real KG verify the KG-enhanced GAI and proposed market availability.",

This approach faces numerous challenges, including its inefficiency in detecting early-stage DR and the growing global prevalence of the disease. To address these limitations, the adoption of automated, efficient, and accurate detection methods is imperative. Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) algorithms have significantly improved the performance of commercial DR detection systems, enabling more precise diagnoses.

Because they operate in complex and dynamic environments, these systems often integrate machine learning (ML)-based components, especially at the perception level. However, high-performance ML solutions require considerable amounts of data, and the resulting models are highly dependent on the training data. These models often leverage hidden patterns, known as dataset bias, that are not related to the concept that is being modeled, which, among other issues, limits the generalization and robustness of the models. Within the perception (images) domain, models trained on a specific dataset often fail to generalize to new datasets, despite the underlying concepts being the same. While various techniques have been proposed, such as diversity strategies, they fail to address the different biases in the data. This paper focuses on the issue of dataset biases for pedestrian classification, a core task for safety-critical autonomous systems. We evaluate the ML model’s generalization on four public reference datasets, along with the use of diversity strategies. To address the dataset biases, we then explore the use of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) techniques. The goal is to allow for the use of multiple large datasets to train a model for a given context, as well as tolerate drifts that might result from changes in the underlying system. Results show a noticeable improvement in the generalization performance of the models, highlighting the potential of such an approach.",

Previous studies have explored various teaching methods, but the effectiveness of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in this context has not yet been widely investigated. This study compares the efficacy of GenAI with video-based active learning methods for teaching programming to university students. Through an experimental design with 40 computer engineering students, academic performance, perception of usefulness and ease of use, and satisfaction and motivation were evaluated. The results showed no statistically significant differences between the groups in academic performance, perception of usefulness and ease of use, or satisfaction and motivation. Both methods proved equally effective in improving learning and maintaining student motivation. These findings suggest that GenAI can be a viable alternative to traditional methods, offering opportunities to diversify pedagogical strategies in programming education. Educators are encouraged to consider integrating GenAI to complement existing methods, ensuring implementation that maintains high levels of perceived control, immersion, and curiosity among students.",

It is imperative to gain a deeper insight into the mechanisms by which GenAI unlocks environmental performance (EP). To tackle this issue, we propose a novel research framework grounded in resource orchestration theory (ROT). Drawing on survey responses from 260 high-tech manufacturing firms in China, we find that resource orchestration capabilities do not independently mediate the GenAI usage–EP relationship but instead require the support of decarbonization capabilities (DCs) to jointly serve as serial mediators. Moreover, environmental dynamism enhances the mediating effect of DCs in the GenAI usage–EP relationship. Our research elucidates the underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions associated with the use of GenAI to achieve environmental sustainability from the perspective of ROT, contributing to the field of technology-enabled management research. Our findings also provide valuable insights to guide firms in their transition towards carbon neutrality.",

The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) may potentially lower the barrier to entry. This research experiments with automatic penetration testing via large language models (LLMs) augmented with security information. This research uses a locally hosted Mistral 7B model with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve penetration testing. When the LLMs are fine tuned with limited and unstructured security data such as privilege escalation articles from a few public web sites, the system succeeds in achieving privilege escalation on Linux hosts. The results of this research suggest that no-cost LLM-assisted penetration testing is possible even on ordinary PCs using locally hosted models. Future research is needed to achieve more diversified attacks and discover zero-day vulnerabilities, perhaps with better prompt engineering, models, and security data.",

Given the heterogeneity of IoT devices and the variability in data distribution, developing strategies to enhance FL performance without overly burdening resource-constrained devices is crucial. This article proposes an FL algorithm based on generative artificial intelligence (GAI) for IoT devices with extreme heterogeneity in data and resources. The algorithm utilizes pretrained GAI models to generate new data, aligning the data distributions of individual IoT devices closer to independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), thereby effectively reducing the heterogeneity of local data. Additionally, the proposed algorithm incorporates data synthesis and resource scheduling strategies to mitigate the heterogeneity of local device resources. Finally, we formulate a joint optimization problem aimed at minimizing total energy consumption while maximizing FL performance. Experimental results demonstrate that, under significant resource and data distribution disparities, most existing solutions struggle to converge, whereas the proposed method converges and achieves superior performance. Compared to existing GAI-based approaches, our method significantly reduces latency and energy consumption.",

We show that the LLM-based approach delivers good scientific content analysis performance for a general classification problem (ACC =0.9), acceptable performance for a domain-specific classification problem (ACC =0.8) and borderline performance for a text comprehension problem (ACC ≈0.69). We conclude that some content analysis tasks with moderate accuracy requirements may be supported by current LLMs. As the technology will evolve rapidly in the foreseeable future, studies on large corpora, where some inaccuracies are tolerable, or workflows that prepare large data sets for human processing, may increasingly benefit from the capabilities of GenAI.",

We explore the use of LLMS to improve and automate EO analysis, making these results more accessible to a broad range of decision makers. We develop a framework using this technology to support the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) and NASA’s Open Science initiative. This framework leverages current work on Earth observation tools, including the Open Data Cube (ODC) [1] and the OEA Algorithm Hub (AlgoHub). [2]In our work, we investigate the ability of large language models to orchestrate and reason with tools created to access geospatial data using the Open Data Cube and the OEA Algorithm Hub [2]. In this paper we propose a natural language analytical framework for orchestrating Earth observation (EO) analysis. The framework uses large language models to interpret an analysis request, devise a solution based on ODC and AlgoHub tools, and execute the analysis. Our experimental investigations demonstrate that an LLM, with its embedded contextual knowledge, can effectively discern and sequence the necessary processing steps required to fulfill Earth observation analysis requests. This research demonstrates the potential of Generative AI (LLMs) in streamlining and enhancing EO analyses and empowering the observation community.In summary, Generative AI (LLMs) can enhance the capabilities of Earth observation analysis by automating tasks, providing natural language interfaces, and facilitating the extraction of valuable insights from the vast and complex datasets generated by remote sensing and EO technologies.",

MATIC employs the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) concept to decompose the textual image generation process into multiple steps, leveraging diverse generative artificial intelligence, including Multimodal Large Language Model (MMLLM) and diffusion model. The framework first generates the desired text and a corresponding prompt for the diffusion model based on user input. The diffusiongenerated image is then examined to remove any undesired text. Meanwhile, the typographic elements are designed to align with the visual content. Finally, the textual image is fused with the aid of a grid coordinate system, evaluated by MMLLM, and further customized by the user through natural language. Experimental results demonstrate that MATIC can produce accurate, high-quality, multilingual textual images that meet user requirements across various domains, including digital marketing, graphic design, and educational content creation.",

This thorough review analyses various facts about ASD, from its early diagnosis and medical treatments to its cutting\&\#x2010;edge therapeutic strategies and research endeavors. The study develops through thoroughly examining cutting\&\#x2010;edge machine learning and deep learning methods used in ASD research. Deep learning, Conditional Inference Forest, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines emerge as key methods for understanding the complicated genomic and neuroimaging landscapes of ASD. Children with autism get benefit from play therapy and game\&\#x2010;based interventions because they provide opportunities for social interaction and skill development. The study also looks into the significance of awareness and early intervention. It offers a forward\&\#x2010;thinking roadmap and highlights the critical need for public education, easily available screening services, and specialized educational programs. The technology will be based on predictions of disease risk, deficits, and behavioral patterns, curating a dataset centered on Indian children and adults and integrating emotional and behavioral nuances. Collaborations with healthcare facilities and governmental organizations can be planned to close the accessibility gap and ensure that ASD treatments are available to people from every socioeconomic background, not just the wealthy few.</p>",

The conventional feature extraction networks employ fixed-size convolutional kernels, which fail to capture different levels of visual features for targets of varying sizes. In this paper, we propose a mechanism called the 3D-Weight Guide Selective Kernel (3D-WGSK) to jointly utilize spatial and channel information of input features to derive three-dimensional weights. These weights are then employed for convolutional kernel selection, enabling adaptive receptive field acquisition for capturing features of targets with different sizes. We devise a network architecture named the 3D-WGSK Net for feature extraction in remote sensing object detection. It possesses the capability of multi-scale information fusion and adaptive kernel adjustment, effectively extracting crucial features of targets with varying sizes. Experimental results on the publicly available DOTA-v1.5 dataset demonstrate the superior detection performance of our method.",

However, these methods predominantly focus on capturing local features using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), neglecting the comprehensive utilization of global spatial-spectral information. To address this limitation, we innovatively propose a multiscale spatial-spectral CNN-transformer network for hyperspectral image super resolution, namely, MSHSR. MSHSR not only applies the local spatial-spectral characteristics but also innovatively facilitates the collaborative exploration and application of spatial details and spectral data globally. Specifically, we first design a multiscale spatial-spectral fusion module, which integrates dilated-convolution parallel branches and a hybrid spectral attention mechanism to address the strong local correlations in HSIs, effectively capturing and fusing multiscale local spatial-spectral information. Furthermore, in order to fully exploit the global contextual consistency in HSIs, we introduce a sparse spectral transformer module. This module processes the previously obtained local spatial-spectral features, thoroughly exploring the elaborate global interrelationship and long-range dependencies among different spectral bands through a coarse-to-fine strategy. Extensive experimental results on three hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, outperforming comparison methods both in quantitative metrics and visual performance.",

Factors contributing to image blur include atmospheric disturbances during long-range imaging or the orbital motion of remote sensing platforms. The existing methods remove blur in remote sensing images using the traditional attention mechanism, which focuses on a limited number of features. However, they often overlook the features among neighboring positions in blurry areas, and these areas contain more relevant features. Leveraging these features can effectively assist in restoring the complex object textures of remote sensing blurry images. To achieve this, we propose a novel implicit neural attention mechanism for assembling more relevant features implied by surrounding coordinates. Specifically, we use the features and their corresponding coordinates to learn the enhanced feature representation with more relevant features, and this representation can be used to derive the deblurred images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method, INA-RSDeblur, outperforms the state-of-the-art deblurring methods in remote sensing blurry images.",

Essentially, GAI excels not only in content generation but also signal processing, offering support for wireless sensing. Hence, we introduce a novel GAI-assisted human flow detection system (G-HFD). Rigorously, G-HFD first uses the channel state information (CSI) to estimate the velocity and acceleration of propagation path length change of the human induced reflection (HIR). Then, given the strong inference ability of the diffusion model, we propose a unified weighted conditional diffusion model (UW-CDM) to denoise the estimation results, enabling detection of the number of targets. Next, we use the CSI obtained by a uniform linear array with wavelength spacing to estimate the HIR’s time of flight and direction of arrival (DoA). In this process, UW-CDM solves the problem of ambiguous DoA spectrum, ensuring accurate DoA estimation. Finally, through clustering, G-HFD determines the number of subflows and the number of targets in each subflow, i.e., the subflow size. The evaluation based on practical downlink communication signals shows G-HFD’s accuracy of subflow size detection can reach 91\%. This validates its effectiveness and underscores the significant potential of GAI in the context of wireless sensing.",

To get a more comprehensive understanding of the selected study, we reviewed the selected studies techniques, and the models, datasets, and metrics used. Our systematic review reveals that generative AI models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoder (VAEs) and autoencoders have been widely used in recommender systems and they perform better than traditional AI techniques. Among the 30 datasets analyzed, MovieLens was the most frequently used, accounting for 33\%, while Amazon datasets accounted for 11\%, Recall and RSME are the most commonly used metrics.

    abstract = "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize teaching and learning applications. This article examines the word cloud, a toolkit often used to scaffold teaching and learning for reflection, critical thinking, and content learning. Addressing the issues in traditional word clouds, semantic word clouds have been developed but they are technically challenging to develop and still problematic. However, generative AI has the potential to develop efficient, accurate, creative, and accessible word clouds. Three different methods representing three major approaches of word cloud generation were developed, implemented, and user evaluated—traditional (baseline), semantic (natural language processing enhanced), and generative AI (generative pretrained transformer based)—in two different language contexts—Chinese (China case) and English (Singapore case). The findings of the study show the technical robustness of the methods, as well as provide key pedagogical insights from the user perspective of instructors of higher education courses in China and Singapore. Implications to the design of word clouds and their application in teaching and learning are discussed.",

    abstract = "Students’ decision-making related to attending college for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees and retaining them within those fields continue to be of focus, especially when considering the national goal of satisfying industry, private, and public sector workforce needs. This is particularly important when considering growing national security concerns and ongoing high cybersecurity and climate change workforce demands. However, despite concerted efforts, low enrollment and student attrition continue to be a challenge, even more so since the onset of the global pandemic. Simultaneously, the utilization of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has seen a sharp increase since 2022 by various stakeholders, most notably college students. Additionally, faculty are encouraged by their higher education institutions to incorporate these tools within classrooms for several reasons, including demands from industry for students to gain knowledge and experience with generative AI tools. Given the importance of understanding the ongoing issue of STEM degree attrition and the increasing utilization of generative AI, this research study explored these two areas using ChatGPT, one of the world's most utilized generative AI language models, within the process. The first research question (RQ\#l) is: What is the top reason why students do notfinish college? The response provided solely emphasized finances and/or financial constraints. Based on that answer, the second research question (RQ \#2) was: Is getting a college degree worth the cost? RQ \#2 was explored to allow a deeper understanding of the initial research question from a different angle. Both questions were analyzed through the lens of two theoretical frameworks, the human capital theory and the principal-agent theory, and results were compared to the literature as a form of research validation. This research study is essential as there is an ongoing increase in the utilization of generative AI in homes, K-12 institutions, and higher education for everyday knowledge, formal and informal education. When considering that soon-to-be and current college students may be using these generative AI tools to make decisions related to pursuing and/or retaining their educational status, it is essential to explore how generative AI system outputs align with what has been researched and documented in the literature. Therefore, this research study explored the application of ChatGPT and the system's responses to research questions as a form of document analysis and analyzed those results using triangulation as a form of validation. The analysis and results of this study contributed directly to the recommendations and feedback to the owners of ChatGPT - OpenAI. Additionally, the results highlighted a need for increased focus on AI ethics related to data input, data output, access to the system, and who has a seat at the table as the company recommends, approves, and implements changes. Limitations of this study are provided along with an overarching concluding statement.",

Within the context of online learning platforms, there is a challenge in efficiently and effectively updating course content, which can impact the quality and relevance of the experience. The aim of this pilot was to utilize GenAI to create and augment educational resources, thus improving the clarity, scaffolding, and engagement of the online degree coursework. The methods employed in this pilot study included a quasi-experimental design where a Performance-Based Admissions (PBA) degree course was selected, its content was optimized using GenAI, and the impact was measured using a Difference-in-Differences (DID) analysis comparing optimized and non-optimized courses. The results indicate a 6\% increase in course pass rates and significant improvements in midterm pass rates, average final grades, and the percentage of assignments submitted on time within the optimized course. Given these results, we estimate a 3\% to 13\% positive impact on second term persistence if all first-term courses received a similar GenAI optimization. The impact of this study is significant, demonstrating the potential of GenAI to revolutionize educational practices by providing quickly-produced, high-quality, low-cost content that enhances student learning outcomes. It supports the shift towards student-centered learning approaches and can be particularly beneficial in resource-constrained environments. In conclusion, the study underscores the transformative role of GenAI in education and emphasizes the need for ethical and responsible use to empower students and improve learning outcomes.",

This cognitive ability enhances their grasp of the content and augments their overall enjoyment. Consequently, the development of an automated system aimed at producing visually faithful images based on textual descriptions, often referred to as the text-to-image task, stands as a profoundly meaningful endeavor. For this reason, a variety of text-to-image generating artificial intelligences (AIs) have been devised until now. Nevertheless, the generative AIs introduced thus far encounter an issue wherein they struggle to uphold the coherence of input sentences, particularly when multiple sentences are provided. Within this paper, we present a remedy to this challenge through the application of prompt editing. Furthermore, our experimental results substantiate that our proposed solution more effectively preserves contextual coherence among the generated images in comparison to other preexisting generative artificial intelligence models. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves performance by at least 30 percent in terms of the similarity of the generated image and by 130 percent in terms of $ROUGE\_{recall}$ .",

To achieve a holistic view, vehicles are typically equipped with multiple sensors. However, processing large volumes of multimodal data increases transmission load, while the dynamic nature of vehicular networks adds to transmission instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, generative artificial intelligence (GAI)-enhanced multimodal semantic communication (SemCom), referred to as G-MSC, designed to handle various vehicular network tasks by employing suitable analog or digital transmission. GAI presents a promising opportunity to transform the SemCom framework by significantly enhancing semantic encoding, semantic information transmission, and semantic decoding. It optimizes multimodal information fusion at the transmitter, enhances channel robustness during transmission, and mitigates noise interference at the receiver. To validate the effectiveness of the G-MSC framework, we conduct a case study showcasing its performance in vehicular communication networks for predictive tasks. The experimental results show that the design achieves reliable and efficient communication in V2X networks. In the end, we present future research directions of G-MSC.",

To address these challenges, we have proposed a novel distributed traffic flow prediction architecture that makes the integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and hierarchical federated learning. This architecture makes the prediction of traffic flow by incorporating spatial self-attention module and traffic delay-aware feature transformation module, which achieves a better balance between communication and computation costs, enhances training efficiency and guarantees data privacy and security.

Challenges with finding meaning have been associated with prolonged grief symptoms that can adversely affect grieving parents’ quality of life. Recently, meaning-centered grief interventions that focus on facilitating adaptive meaning-making after loss have shown therapeutic benefits in reducing prolonged grief symptoms in bereaved individuals. However, these interventions are mostly administered in one-on-one, in-person settings, which limits their accessibility to a broader population due to logistical and locational constraints. While existing videoconferencing applications can provide remote bereavement support and deliver grief therapies, they often lack engaging user experiences and features to support high interactivity, guided imagery and mindfulness exercises commonly used in meaning-centered grief therapies. We hypothesize that the immersive and interactive nature of a networked immersive virtual reality (IVR) system, enhanced with custom content creation features from text-to-image generative artificial intelligence (genAI) models, will create a unique and individualized therapeutic experience that supports meaning-centered grief techniques and activities for bereaved parents in a shared virtual world.

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has been developing rapidly in China. However, we have little knowledge of how well the GAIs are performing at answering course-related open questions, especially in Chinese. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the performances of GAIs in answering course-related open questions from both machine and manual evaluation perspectives. The results from this study showed that GAIs got unsatisfactory scores in this situation. Two different aspects of comparison of GAIs’ scores are discussed. More study on evaluating the performance of GAI is needed to investigate the capabilities of answering course-related open questions in the future.",

In this study, we demonstrate a novel application of GenAI for epidemic modeling. We employed GenAI for creating agents living in a hypothetical town in simulations and simulating their behavior within the context of an ongoing pandemic. We performed a series of simulations to quantify the impact of agent traits and the availability of information for health condition, virus, and government guidelines on the disease spread patterns in terms of peak time and epidemic duration. We also characterized the most influential factors in agents' decision-making using random forest model.",

This paper presents a routing protocol for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), incorporating a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The proposed system utilizes BDI-based generative AI models, which rely on predefined logic and rules rather than machine learning to make real-time routing decisions. These decisions are based on data from vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, roadside units (RSUs) and IoT sensors, which integrate traffic density, congestion levels, collision avoidance and hazard detection. The system aims to optimize the accuracy of route selection, energy consumption, and communication latency. The simulation results, implemented using NS3 for real-world traffic scenarios, show improvements in route selection accuracy, collision avoidance, and energy efficiency compared to traditional routing methods. Specifically, the proposed system achieved a route selection accuracy of 95\%, a collision avoidance rate of 95\%, and reduced the communication latency to 105 ms, outperforming the other two methods. Furthermore, energy consumption was minimized and reduced to 85 J per route. These results highlight the potential of BDI-based routing with generative AI to improve ITS performance, particularly in real-time traffic management.",

    abstract = "Communities of Practice (CoPs) groups share knowledge and expertise across disciplinary collectives and industrial sectors. This theoretical construct assumes learning occurs in and across societal contexts where individuals mutually engage in collective, symbolically shared repertoires. Of late, CoPs have been explored regarding the use of technology platforms to enhance learning and to extend symbolically collective learning activities. However, the extensive and recent saturation of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) calls for inquiry into how CoPs understand and adopt this ubiquitous technology discussion relative to shared repertoires. This is especially true given the lack of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) research into GenAI adoption at scale. The present study seeks to uncover how the prominent CoPs of Finance, Art, and Software Development understand GenAI as they discuss their technology adoption practices in online forums. Specifically, more than 2.1 million words of community discussion were examined lexically to reveal the manner by which varied CoPs generate shared repertoires for their community members. Findings indicate that types of practice disciplines relate to the lexical dialectics of Practice/Technology, People/Replacements, and Authenticity/Inauthenticity, as well as insightful discourses regarding what counts as work and adoption. A first for HCI, CoPs, and GenAI research, this study provides additional suggestions for future CoPs symbolically shared repertoires relative to new technologies, as well as how GenAI may be implicated in the adoption, work, and learning-based praxes of heterogeneous disciplinary communities. “Where the artificiality of all that’s being created, the lack of that ‘spark’ that makes an image, a design, even the concept for a product will become so sterile, so overly tasteless that a new culture of ‘human generated content and products’ will become, first a contra-culture, and then a possible rebirth of what really makes our creation unique: That the things we make as humans are our own and nurture us as a species.” “It does not replace programmers, c’mon.

Wireless channels are influenced by many factors, including path loss, reflection, fading, and interference, making them complex and difficult to model and predict. Although some traditional wireless channel modeling methods are effective, they have limitations in handling complex multipath effects and nonlinear characteristics. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has the ability to generate robust data and therefore can be potentially used to model realistic wireless channel characteristics. However, there exist some challenges in GAI for wireless channel modeling, including physical layer network security issues, limited generalization ability, and the bandwidth consumption of centralized training. This article introduces a GAI-based wireless channel modeling framework, which leverages blockchain and federated learning to address efficiency, network security, and data privacy concerns in GAI channel modeling. Blockchain technology, through distributed ledgers and smart contracts, enables resource sharing and efficient utilization, enhancing computational efficiency and reducing network security risks. Federated learning allocates training tasks to different devices and nodes, thus allowing model training without centralizing data, protecting user privacy, and reducing network bandwidth usage. This article demonstrates the performance and effectiveness of the proposed framework through numerical results.",

This technique entails the manipulation of input queries to improve the quality and relation of the textual outputs of these models. New findings point to the fact that through the enhancement of the aspect of prompt engineering it could indeed be a way of significantly boosting LLM performance through a change of the input query format. This paper highlights the practical use of the prompt engineering concept to Tamil-based LLMs with an explicit purpose of developing a well-structured process capable of generating accurate and contextually relevant conversational responses. Thus, with subtle changes to how prompts are offered, this research aims to enhance the efficacy of Tamil LLMs that demand trivial data entry. The research uses the Query Transformation Module (QTM), which is an elaborate method developed to systematically change the input prompts into three forms of inquiries. Therefore, each format is built with objectives and key points in mind to enhance the understanding of the models as well as the results. To measure the effectiveness of this strategy, the QTM was employed with leading Tamil LLMs SKT GPT-2 and Tamil ChatGPT. We employed four different query methods in our experiments: all the initially employed unaltered request and three modified requests according to the QTM. The evaluation was made using Google SSA to fit the evaluation criteria of naturalness and specificity for the sentences generated by the models. Our experimental findings show that overall, there is a reasonable improvement in the performance by an average of 11 percent. Identified that there is an increase of 46\% in the quality of generated sentences when using the transformed queries as compared to the unmodified prompts. This improvement also depicts how the QTM has an effectiveness of enhancing the performance of Tamil LLMs, resulting into its usability as a tool in the corresponding field of prompt engineering.",

    abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is profoundly reshaping the educational ecosystem, driving the transition of education into a new era characterized by "human-machine" collaborative evolution. In this context, cultivating innovative talents with "machine-irreplaceable" capabilities has become increasingly imperative, as critical thinking, creativity, and related competencies are now regarded as essential attributes for college students in the intelligent era. Nevertheless, the impact of GAI on students' creativity remains a subject of debate within academia, with no consensus on whether it enhances or undermines creative potential. To address this gap, this study investigated the influence of the generative AI tool Kimi AI on creativity among 113 college students, utilizing a single-factor between-subjects experimental design. Creativity was operationalized through scores obtained from an alien-drawing task, a widely recognized measure of divergent thinking. The results demonstrate that GAI, when employed as a "learning companion," facilitates sustained interaction with students, thereby effectively fostering the development of their creative abilities. As the transition from weak AI to strong AI progresses, a critical challenge in the intelligent era lies in determining how to effectively integrate GAI into educational frameworks to enhance not only creativity but also other core competencies essential for future-ready graduates.},

    abstract = "Conventional approaches to dietary assessment are primarily grounded in self-reporting methods or structured interviews conducted under the supervision of dietitians. These methods, however, are often subjective, inaccurate, and time-intensive. Although artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions have been devised to automate the dietary assessment process, prior AI methodologies tackle dietary assessment in a fragmented landscape (e.g., merely recognizing food types or estimating portion size) and encounter challenges in their ability to generalize across a diverse range of food categories, dietary behaviors, and cultural contexts. Recently, the emergence of multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4V, has exhibited transformative potential across a wide range of tasks in various research domains. These models have demonstrated remarkable generalist intelligence and accuracy, owing to their large-scale pre-training on broad datasets and substantially scaled model size. In this study, we explore the application of GPT-4V powering multimodal ChatGPT for dietary assessment, along with prompt engineering and passive monitoring techniques. We evaluated the proposed pipeline using a self-collected, semi free-living dietary intake dataset, captured through wearable cameras. Our findings reveal that GPT-4V excels in food detection under challenging conditions without any fine-tuning or adaptation using food-specific datasets. By guiding the model with specific language prompts (e.g., African cuisine), it shifts from recognizing common staples like rice and bread to accurately identifying regional dishes like banku and ugali. Another standout feature of GPT-4V is its contextual awareness. GPT-4V can leverage surrounding objects as scale references to deduce the portion sizes of food items, further facilitating the process of dietary assessment.",

In this letter, we propose a GAI-assisted SemCom framework, named Gen-SC, where sufficient samples for training SemCom transceivers are generated using GAI as per user contextual information. In addition, to guide the GAI model in producing contextually relevant content, a discriminator is incorporated into Gen-SC to measure the disparity between generated samples and actual samples. The simulation results demonstrate that the Gen-SC achieves higher semantic accuracy, especially when the original training samples are insufficient, in contrast to traditional SemCom without knowledge enhancement.",

This is accurate even though its potential uses in data synthesis, virtual assistants, content development and the creative arts are exciting. These difficulties appeal for a careful analysis of GAI's place in cybersecurity (CS).

In addition, our proposal includes defense tactics that leverage GAI capabilities. These strategies include the areas of detection, deception and adversarial training, with the aim of reducing the potential risks associated with cyber threats induced by GAI. Threat actors employ the use of GAI to augment Evasion, obfuscation and deception techniques, hence increasing the effectiveness and difficulty of detecting their attacks. This study highlights the importance of using proactive defense measures. The dual capability of GAI for legal and illegal usage highlights the need to comprehend and mitigate its influence inside the CKC framework.

Moreover, the suggested approach places significant emphasis on precisely predicting upcoming occurrences in real-time, facilitating prompt reactions to market volatility and offering a valuable resource for airlines, travel agents, and customers alike. In order to enhance the accuracy of real-time forecasts, we utilize a web-based platform that allows for smooth interaction with live data streams and guarantees swift updates.

This shared parking platform aims to mitigate the challenge of long search for an unoccupied residential parking space, limited parking facilities, and time-consuming property approval and payment process, providing drivers with more accessible and affordable options while reducing the daily time spent searching for parking. This platform will enable residential parking owners to rent out their parking spaces to residents/drivers who are in need of a convenient and well-priced parking space for a couple of hours, days or longer period. This case study aims to explore the development and implementation of this platform – both web and mobile – that leverages Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and user-centric design to revolutionize the parking experience, fostering a more sustainable and streamlined approach to sharing economy. The business model focuses on a commission-based revenue approach, ensuring revenue potential and scalability.",

The data acquired from the FER stage informs GenAI systems—such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs)—to produce contextually relevant and emotionally resonant responses. The proposed system leverages a sophisticated camera setup to capture facial data with high accuracy under diverse lighting conditions, ensuring robust and reliable emotion inference. Virtual avatars complete the multimodal experience by generating corresponding nonverbal cues. Special attention is given to creating a dynamic feedback loop for continuous learning and adaptation, leading to increasingly effective human-computer dialogues.

In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework, detailed system modeling and simulation experiments are carried out in this paper. The experimental results show that the GMASS algorithm can significantly improve the content security while maintaining the quality of the generated content. In addition, by comparing with traditional steganography techniques, GMASS's superior performance in resisting various attack methods and media content generation frameworks is demonstrated.",

In this work, we propose a novel generative model based on ControlNet and achieve precise control and high-quality rendering of extreme weather features by combining a sparsely connected Squeeze-and-Excitation module with a zero-convolution design. The proposed model excels in generating highly realistic extreme weather scenes, including heavy rain and snow, while significantly enhancing the ability to fine-tune weather characteristic parameters. Experimental results validate the model's exceptional generation quality and robust control stability, which not only realistically reproduces complex weather scenes but also allows flexible adjustments to weather characteristics such as rainfall intensity, snowflake density, and flame range. Compared to previous methods, the model demonstrates substantial improvements in image detail fidelity, weather feature consistency and generation efficiency. This technology shows immense potential for applications in disaster simulation and early warning systems.",
