We aimed to summarize the evidence on the performance metrics of GAI in the SR process. Methods PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and ProQuest Dissertations \& Theses Global were searched from their inception up to March 2025. Only experimental studies that compared GAI with other GAIs or human reviewers at any stage of the SR were included. Modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2 was used to assess the quality of the studies that used GAI in the study selection process. We summarized the findings of the included studies using a narrative approach. Results Out of 7418 records screened, 30 studies were included. These studies used GAI tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Microsoft Bing AI. GAI appears to be effective for participant, intervention, comparator, and outcome formulation and data extraction processes, including complex information. However, because of inconsistent reliability, GAI is not recommended for literature search and study selection as it may retrieve nonrelevant articles and yield inconsistent results. There was mixed evidence on whether GAI can be used for risk of bias assessment. Studies using GAI for study selection were generally of high quality based on the modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2. Conclusions GAI shows promising support in participant, intervention, comparator, and outcome-based question formulation and data extraction. Although it holds potential to enhance the SR process in healthcare, further practical application and validated evidence are needed before it can be fully integrated into standard workflows."

Three studies were conducted to examine how GenAI is used in hospitality management and test the conceptual model: a three-wave questionnaire survey (N = 333), a quasi-field experiment (N = 227), and an in-depth interview (N = 11). The results indicate that GenAI dependence promotes service innovation by decreasing affective rumination, and this beneficial indirect path is amplified by employees’ neuroticism. Meanwhile, GenAI dependence inhibits service innovation by decreasing problem-solving pondering, and this unfavourable indirect path is weakened by employees’ conscientiousness.

However, the relatively low translation efficiency of exogenous mRNA often limits its wide application. Here, we propose a computational framework called UTailoR (UTR tailor), which significantly improves the challenge by optimizing 5' UTR sequences based on a two-step artificial intelligence strategy. We first develop a deep-learning-based discriminative model for predicting mRNA translation efficiency with 5' UTR sequences, and then present a generative model to generate optimized 5' UTR sequences, which are designed to be highly close to the original sequences but predicted to result in high translation efficiency. The experimental results show that the UTailoR-optimized sequences outstrip the corresponding original sequences by ∼ 200\%. This work provides an efficient and convenient method for the mRNA 5' UTR optimization, which can be easily accessed at http://www.cuilab.cn/utailor."

This mixed-methods exploratory study investigated how Chinese EAL students perceived and used GenAI, and how these attitudes and behaviors reflected their Critical Language Awareness (CLA). Survey data were collected from 320 Chinese undergraduate and graduate students studying in China and abroad, supplemented by in-depth semi-structured interviews with five volunteers. Quantitative findings revealed that, while participants valued GenAI for reducing language barriers and enhancing writing mechanics, they remained wary of issues related to originality, transparency, and ethical accountability. Qualitative analysis further illuminated participants' emerging CLA, evident in their negotiations of power (managing overreliance and misinformation), ideology (navigating dominant academic norms), and social justice (acknowledging cultural biases encoded in GenAI training data). Although students were primarily motivated by pragmatic benefits, such as improved grammar, structure, and efficiency, they also recognized GenAI's potential to perpetuate monolingual, Western-centric perspectives. These results underscore the need to embed CLA principles in GenAI-assisted pedagogy. By encouraging students to critically interrogate GenAI outputs, question linguistic hierarchies, and reflect on sociocultural contexts, educators can better leverage GenAI's affordances while fostering ethical, culturally responsive, and equitable writing practices."

Gastroenterology and hepatology in particular will be transformed due to the multimodal workflows that integrate endoscopic video, radiologic imaging, tabular data, and unstructured note text. GenAI will impact the entire spectrum of clinical experience, from administrative tasks, diagnostic guidance, and treatment recommendations. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, genAI is more flexible, with one platform able to be used across multiple tasks. Initial evidence suggests benefits in lower-level administrative tasks, such as clinical documentation, medical billing, and scheduling; and information tasks, such as patient education and summarization of the medical literature. No evidence exists for genAI solutions for more complex tasks relevant to clinical care, such as clinical reasoning for diagnostic and treatment decisions that may affect patient outcomes. Challenges of output reliability, data privacy, and useful integration remain; potential solutions include robust validation, regulatory oversight, and "human–AI teaming" strategies to ensure safe, effective deployment. We remain optimistic in the potential of genAI to augment clinical expertise due to the adaptability of genAI to handle multiple data modalities to obtain and focus relevant information flows and the human-friendly interfaces that facilitate ease of use. We believe that the potential of genAI for dynamic human-algorithmic interactions may allow for a degree of clinician-directed customization to enhance human presence.}

The China Nurses Network conducted a three-day training session on “GAI for Nursing Research” theme, we selected 23 nurses by a convenience sampling method among participating in the training. The researchers conducted three focus group interviews at the end of each day. All focus groups were interviewed face-to-face to facilitate interaction, data collection, and observation. The data were analyzed using conventional content analysis and coded manually. Results The results showed that nurses’ use of GAI to support scientific research was dynamic and characterized by evolving perceptions and practices. Four themes and 11 sub-themes emerged from the analysis: 1) utilization efficacy: cope with research ability, affected by many factors; 2) booster research: growth and challenges go hand in hand; 3) role reversal: from GAI-dominated to nurse-dominated; 4) beautiful dream: more features on research, more assistants on clinical care. Conclusions The effectiveness of GAI in supporting clinical nurses in conducting research is mainly limited by differences in personal research literacy, lack of ethical regulation, and information accuracy.

However, the complex multi-physics reactions within batteries make traditional mathematical models inadequate for comprehensively revealing their mechanisms. The key to solving this problem lies in introducing data-driven approaches, which have laid a solid foundation for battery research and development through extensive accumulation of experimental data and extraction of effective information. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), leveraging its powerful latent pattern learning and data generation capabilities, has already found widespread applications in protein structure prediction, material inverse design, and data augmentation, demonstrating its broad application prospects. Applying GAI to battery research workflows with diverse battery data resources could provide innovative solutions to challenges in battery research. In this perspective, we introduce the core principles and latest advancements of generative models (GMs), including Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), and Diffusion Model (DM), which can learn the latent distribution of the input samples to generate new data by sampling from it. Applications of GAI in battery research are then reviewed. For battery materials design, by learning material compositions, structures, and properties, GM can generate novel candidate materials with desired properties through conditional constraints, significantly extending the chemical space to be explored. For electrode microstructure characterization, GM can serve as a bridge for interconversion and integration of different image data, enhance the quality of microscopic characterization, and generate realistic synthetic data. For battery state estimation, GM can perform data augmentation and feature extraction on battery datasets, which benefits the model performance for battery state estimation. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future development directions in terms of data governance and model design, including data quality and diversity, data standardization and sharing, usability of synthetic data, interpretability of GM, and foundational models for battery research. For the innovation and advancement of battery technology, this perspective offers theoretical references and practical guidelines for implementing GAI as an effective tool in battery research workflows by discussing its status and prospects in this field."

Background Recently, GenAI-assisted teaching has been widely recognised as a trend in nursing education reform. HOTS and AI literacy are important for nursing students in the era of artificial intelligence. However, studies on the use of GenAI to enhance the HOTS and AI literacy of undergraduate nursing students are limited. Design A quasi-experimental study. Methods Based on OBE theory, interactive teaching strategies using GenAI were introduced into a nursing course. Overall, 132 third-year nursing undergraduates enrolled in this course were randomly divided into experimental (n = 66) and control groups (n = 66). Results After completing the course, the HOTS scores of nursing undergraduates (P = 0.018) and AI literacy (P < 0.001) in the experimental group were significantly better than those in the control group. There was a significant difference in the HOTS scores (P < 0.001) and AI literacy (P < 0.001) between the experimental group before and after the course. Conclusion GenAI-assisted teaching could help nursing undergraduates improve their HOTS and AI literacy. As an important auxiliary teaching tool, GenAI should be integrated into other nursing courses and widely applied in nursing education in the future."

This study seeks to fill this gap by drawing on information behavior literature to explore the effect of GenAI across the entrepreneurial spectrum. By leveraging large language models and prompt engineering patterns, we examined how GenAI could generate accurate, relevant, and inspiring content through various interaction scenarios. Our findings suggest that GenAI significantly mitigates early-stage entrepreneurial information asymmetry and supports sophisticated problem-solving when coupled with appropriate domain knowledge and prompt engineering techniques. However, GenAI’s task complexity limits its use in late-stage entrepreneurial exploitation activities. Finally, this study provides insight into research avenues and practical applications."

However, inconsistent product quality complicates user decisions, jeopardizing both the sustainability of GAI technologies and their broader adoption. To address these challenges, this study proposes a user-centered evaluation framework that integrates fuzzy social networks with advanced multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) approaches. Grounded theory is first employed to establish a ''marketing-information-product-individual'' system of factors influencing GAI product adoption. Next, fuzzy social networks reduce semantic ambiguity and mitigate expert bias, while the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method uncovers causal relationships among these factors. The DEMATEL-based Analytic Network Process (DANP) then quantifies the relative importance of each factor, followed by a modified VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method to comprehensively evaluate representative GAI products. The findings reveal that product maturity exerts the strongest driving force, whereas perceived effect experiences the highest overall impact. Information reliability and the individual dimension carry the greatest weights. Moreover, current products display notable deficiencies in risk management, user service, and ease of use, all of which warrant developers' attention to enhance user satisfaction and adoption. In light of these results, the study proposes targeted optimization strategies for four distinct GAI products. By integrating fuzzy social networks and MADM methodologies, this framework offers a rigorous, systematic evaluation tool that significantly improves decision-making accuracy and promotes the sustainable development of GAI applications."

Methods A structured questionnaire consisting of 56 items across six domains was administered, covering demographics, general and TKM-specific GenAI use, satisfaction, educational experiences, and future expectations. Descriptive statistics, univariable analysis, multivariable logistic regression, and correlation analysis were performed. Results A total of 234 students across six academic years participated in the survey. Most respondents were aware of GenAI (88.5 \%) and used it for general purposes (79.9 \%). However, only 16.2 \% actively used it for TKM learning. While 70.4 \% were satisfied with using GenAI in general, only 45.8 \% felt satisfied with its use for TKM education. Factors significantly associated with GenAI use or satisfaction included enrollment in the TKM curriculum, older age, prior major, scholarship receipt, and self-directed GenAI learning. Although only 18.8 \% had experienced GenAI in formal TKM courses, 96.2 \% viewed GenAI as necessary in TKM education. Conclusion A notable gap exists between students’ interest and the limited integration of GenAI in TKM curricula. To close this gap, GenAI should be systematically incorporated into educational programs, accompanied by faculty training and institutional support to enhance students’ digital readiness and learning outcomes."

    abstract = "While generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is increasingly used to create content, it is often criticized for collecting and training private data and induces potential copy infringement issue. This dilemma leaves a question of whether GAI increases or decreases creators' work sharing. Drawn on protection motivation theory, this study examines how the launch of a GAI system affects creators' contributions on an original work sharing platform. We discover that GAI poses a threat to drawing-category creators, leading to a significant crowding-out effect on their contributions. Specifically, compared with that of non-drawing-category creators, the work sharing of drawing-category creators decreases by 19.64 \% and 14.29 \% within a short period after the launch and removal of the GAI system, respectively. We discover that creators' protective behavior is driven by GAI-related copyright infringement. Compared with creators without copyright protection, those with copyright protection are more inclined to cease contributions or even leave the platform. We further find that among copyright-protected creators, top creators, evidenced by their acquisition of a large number of supporters or platform honor titles, exhibit more pronounced responses to protect their works due to their higher coping efficacy. Notably, this threat reduces creators' sharing behavior or even lead to their exit from the platform. Nevertheless, such reduction is likely to gradually recover once the threat subsides. Overall, our findings have important implications for whether and how platform managers adopt GAI systems, especially in an original work sharing context."

As the first surgical applications of generative artificial intelligence are applied, this perspective paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current applications and future perspectives for the application of generative artificial intelligence in surgery, from preoperative planning to training. Generative artificial intelligence can be used before surgery for planning and decision support by extracting patient information and providing patients with information and simulation regarding the procedure. Intraoperatively, generative artificial intelligence can document data that is normally not captured as intraoperative adverse events or provide information to help decision-making. Postoperatively, GAIs can help with patient discharge and follow-up. The ability to provide real-time feedback and store it for later review is an important capability of GAIs. GAI applications are emerging as highly specialized, task-specific tools for tasks such as data extraction, synthesis, presentation, and communication within the realm of surgery. GAIs have the potential to play a pivotal role in facilitating interaction between surgeons and artificial intelligence."

    abstract = "In telecommunication technology, identifying standard-essential patents (SEPs) plays a crucial role in the management of intellectual property. This technology is regulated by technical standards that are largely based on the content of SEPs. These patents are declared standard-essential by their owners because they contain elements of a technical standard. The declaration process leaves room for over- and under-declaration, which entails risks for organizations. This paper focuses on the question of how generative artificial intelligence can be used to assess the standard-essentiality of 5G technology patents. For this purpose, the standard-essentiality is assessed using different prompts with four Large Language Models (LLMs) in two variants. In the first variant, the LLM results are generated by a rather simple prompt and compared with an approach based on unsupervised and supervised machine learning. The result shows that large LLMs are capable of assessing the standard-essentiality. In the second variant, the best-performing LLM is selected and the prompt is expanded to include selected parts of a technical standard. While the assessment results remain largely the same, the LLM is now able to explain in which detail a patent is part of a standard. This has several implications for patent evaluation, licensing and litigation strategies."

The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence technology has provided the conditions for researchers to transition from sequential organization of bibliographic references to the deconstruction and reorganization of knowledge elements. This study, reveals the intrinsic relationship patterns between multi-granularity knowledge in ancient texts from perspectives such as logical relationships, frame semantic associations, hierarchical structures, and feature associations, and constructs a multidimensional knowledge representation model for ancient texts. Furthermore, a YAML prompt template was designed by integrating large language models with the deconstruction of multi-granularity knowledge elements from ancient texts, and experiments were conducted using the Chinese classic “Records of the Grand Historian: Biographies.” The results indicate that the method developed in this study for the deconstruction and reorganization of knowledge elements in ancient texts exhibits notable characteristics such as multi-granularity, cross-document application, refinement, multiple perspectives, efficiency improvement, and scalability, demonstrating potential for application in the field of knowledge services for ancient texts."

This study aimed to analyse the quality of advice on first aid for seizures generated by a commercially developed chatbot in comparison with its customised version. Methods The baseline version of ChatGPT (model GPT-4o) and the same chatbot customised using a specialised knowledge base and prompt engineering were tested in four scenarios mimicking bystander requests for instructions on how to help a victim with seizures. The scenarios included ongoing seizures and postictal states, with or without consciousness and breathing. A checklist-based evaluation was conducted. Results In total, 120 user-to-chatbot dialogues were generated (2 chatbots × 15 dialogues × 4 scenarios). The baseline chatbot always failed to consider the victim’s state, including whether the seizures are continuing, or if the victim in the postictal period is conscious and breathing normally. Its advice was non-selective and inaccurate, with frequent omissions of key recommendations on first aid and suggestions of inadequate measures. The customised chatbot-generated guidance was consistently tailored to the victim’s condition, significantly more precise and completely safe. Depending on the scenario, the mean percentage of chatbot responses that fulfilled the checklist items was 14–49 \% for the baseline chatbot and 77–92 \% for the customised version (p ≤ 0.039). Conclusions Whereas the publicly available version of the chatbot is not acceptable for first aid counselling, its expert-informed customisation ensures high accuracy and safety of generated advice. Further research in this field is advisable."

Improving the efficiency of aircraft conceptual design while ensuring quality is an important challenge. Intelligent technologies such as neural networks have played significant roles in areas like aerodynamics and structural analysis. However, due to issues such as high data demands and difficulties in transfer learning, their application in the conceptual design phase has been limited. The rise of generative artificial intelligence, exemplified by Large Language Model (LLM), offers a new approach to this problem. Therefore, this study proposes a methodology for generating aircraft conceptual design solutions based on LLMs and develops a prototype system. First, four of the current best-performing general-purpose LLMs are selected for deployment as foundational models. Then, based on the general prompt framework of LLMs, schema for aircraft conceptual design solutions, and real-world design cases, task prompts for generating aircraft conceptual design solutions are crafted, resulting in three types of prompts: Full-Instruction, 1-Shot, and 5-Shot. Finally, the prototype system is utilized to design conceptual solutions, and the model-generated solutions are compared with those designed by engineers from both objective and subjective perspectives. The experimental results indicate that LLMs demonstrate conceptual design capabilities comparable to those of engineers, exhibiting strong generalization ability and potential for innovative design."

This systematic review study investigates how to design SRL activities using GenAI. We examined 73 articles published over the past five years, drawn from four databases: Web of Science, ProQuest, ERIC, and Scopus. This study has three major empirical findings. First, six pedagogical affordances from GenAI across the three phases of SRL—forethought, Performance, and self-reflection—are (i) creating personalized learning objectives; (ii) searching for, analyzing, and integrating resources; (iii) monitoring and evaluating progress; (iv) recommending learning strategies; (v) recording progress and providing feedback; and (vi) generating new ideas and examples. Second, popular student learning activities using GenAI in each phase are information searching in the forethought; strategies for problem-solving in the performance, and obtaining feedback and conducting self-assessments in the self-reflection. Third, two major dimensions influencing student engagement in SRL using GenAI are individual and environmental. Finally, we visualize how the three empirical findings relate to each other. Our findings help us understand how AI as a human-machine collaborative tool affects the SRL process. This study provides practical recommendations for facilitating SRL in GenAI-enhanced environments and offers guidance for the design and development of personalized GenAI learning tools."

Materials and methods We conducted a systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines. Studies investigating generative AI in IBD care were identified through PubMed and Embase (Jan 2020–Sep 2024). Results From 2875 records, 8 studies (2023–2024) met inclusion criteria: 5 on patient education, 2 on decision support, and 1 on research ideation. For patient education, ChatGPT provided clear and accurate responses, with accuracy reaching 84.2 \% in a study, though sometimes lacked consistency. In decision support, ChatGPT’s classifications of ulcerative colitis severity aligned with clinician assessments in 80 \% of cases and in 87.8 \% of cases for guideline-based dysplasia management. For research ideation, ChatGPT generated highly relevant (mean score: 4.9 ± 0.26) and clear (4.8 ± 0.41) questions, but lacked specificity (2.86/5) and originality (1.07/5).

    abstract = "Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications related to agriculture have recently gained in use and attention. They are indeed valuable tools for interpreting data, improving production chains, and optimizing the use of natural resources. Among AI models, the most recent and promising area is represented by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI). After an initial description of its general model architectures, this work aims to review its practical uses and potentials in the following individual sectors: agriculture, precision farming, and animal farming, as well as interdisciplinary applications. The literature search was carried out using the SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases. GAI holds immense potential for revolutionizing agriculture, offering solutions ranging from precision farming to pest management and supply chain optimization. Though some applications can extend beyond efficiency gains, and hallucinations occurrence i.e. false output information presented as fact, remains an open issue, GAI can be decisive for tasks like improving training datasets, refining models, and facilitating time series analysis. This review extensively describes the vital importance of these tasks for agriculture, precision and animal farming, caused by the rise of new technologies. As a result, by embracing and responsibly implementing GAI applications, it is possible to create a more sustainable and resilient future for agriculture and precision farming.

Considering the potential transformative impact of GenAI on university students' learning and research practices, this research examines the patterns of use, perceived benefits, and drawbacks of GenAI among undergraduates and postgraduates at universities in Hong Kong. This research employs the 5E instructional model to systematically investigate the effectiveness of GenAI tools in supporting learning and research among local university students. The 170 valid responses revealed generally positive perceptions of the benefits of using GenAI in learning and research-related activities. However, they also acknowledged its potential drawbacks on ethical issues such as plagiarism and academic dishonesty. In addition, respondents agreed that GenAI could effectively support their learning and research activities despite concerns about potential skill deficits, such as diminished critical thinking and analytical abilities caused by the excessive use of GenAI. These findings highlight the increasingly critical role that academic communities like libraries could play in promoting ethical, effective, and literate use of GenAI technologies through targeted training, tool curation, and research support services."

While generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has the potential to revolutionize green logistics, several barriers still prevent its widespread adoption. In existing literature, little is known about applications, drivers, enablers, critical barriers, and challenges associated with implementing GAI along with green logistics. To fill this gap, this study aims to systematically identify and assess the existing body of knowledge on the GAI and green logistics nexus, drawing on a systematic literature review carried out in compliance with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) protocol. The study identifies 34 key GAI-driven green logistics applications, 23 drivers and enablers, and 38 major barriers and challenges. The findings illustrate that GAI-driven green logistics applications, such as risk assessment and mitigation, decision support and real-time environmental response, resilience testing and scenario planning, are essential for developing sustainable logistics ecosystems. Organizational readiness, stakeholder collaboration, and supportive regulatory frameworks emerge as crucial enablers, while lack of digital infrastructure, investment costs, and regulatory gaps constitute significant barriers. The study proposes a decision-making framework to prioritize policy initiatives that could promote GAI adoption in green logistics. This research fills current knowledge gaps and has significant implications for supply chain stakeholders, scholars, and policymakers aiming to support sustainable and cutting-edge logistics systems."

With the growing integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, there is a pressing need to understand its potential as a clinical decision support tool. While Generative Artificial Intelligence models show high accuracy and consistency, their ability to navigate complex, context-sensitive scenarios remains in question. Objectives This study aimed to compare the clinical decision-making performance of emergency nurses from Israel and Italy with Generative Artificial Intelligence models (Claude-3.5, ChatGPT-4.0, and Gemini-1.5). It evaluated differences in severity assessment, hospitalization decisions, and test selection, while exploring the influence of demographic and professional characteristics on decision accuracy. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted among 82 emergency nurses (49 from Italy, 33 from Israel), each independently evaluating five standardized clinical cases. Their decisions were compared with those generated by Generative Artificial Intelligence models using a structured evaluation rubric. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, chi-square tests, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to assess predictive accuracy. Results Generative Artificial Intelligence models exhibited higher overall decision accuracy and stronger alignment with expert recommendations. However, notable discrepancies emerged in hospitalization decisions and severity assessments. For example, in Case 2, Generative Artificial Intelligence rated severity as level 1, while Italian and Israeli nurses rated it at 1.98 and 2.23, respectively (P < 0.01, F = 199). In Case 1, only 4.1 \% of Italian nurses recommended hospitalization compared to 30.3 \% of Israeli nurses, whereas all Generative Artificial Intelligence models advised hospitalization. Nurses showed greater variability in test selection and severity judgments, reflecting their use of clinical intuition and contextual reasoning. Demographics such as age, gender, and years of experience did not significantly predict accuracy. Conclusions Generative Artificial Intelligence models demonstrated consistency and expert alignment but lacked the contextual sensitivity vital in emergency care. These results highlight the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence as a clinical decision-support tool while emphasizing the continued importance of human clinical judgment."

However, there is limited evidence pertaining to the impact of AI-mediated instruction on postgraduate students’ psycho-affective factors and the overall learning climate in English as a foreign language (EFL) context. To address this gap, the present study drew on motivational climate theory (MCT) to explore postgraduate EFL students’ perceptions of the role of GAI technologies in their emotional engagement and goal orientation. To do so, an interview was conducted with 30 postgraduate students using maximum variation sampling. The results of the inductive thematic analysis revealed that AI-mediated instruction had affected both the emotional engagement and goal orientation of the students. In particular, it was found that GAI tools fostered emotional engagement by ‘enlightening teacher-student classroom relationships’, ‘making the overall classroom culture/climate engaging, motivating, and updated’, ‘improving teachers’ action, instruction, and feedback quality’, ‘providing a personalized, interactive, and autonomy supporting education’, and ‘taping into learner-specific idiosyncrasies and individual differences’. Furthermore, GAI tools affected the students’ goal orientation by ‘facilitating the mastery of course content’, ‘setting personalized and achievable goals’, ‘fostering students’ performance comparison in the classroom’, and ‘providing a reflective and adaptive learning environment’. The findings are discussed and implications are provided for EFL teachers, students, teacher educators, and policymakers concerning the interplay of GAI, emotions, goal orientation, and motivational climate."

Although the supervised models now in use are competent, they frequently rely on annotated datasets and create challenges regarding uninterpretability and limited generalization ability. To overcome the limitations, this research proposes a Generative Artificial Intelligence Sequence to sequence the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers model to generate concise summaries. During the generation of the output sequence, the model takes into account data from various segments of the input sequence by utilizing a modified abstractive cross-attention technique. Specifically, the Generative Artificial Intelligence assists in removing grammatical mistakes in summaries via the application of the Global Surrogate method, which ensures the clarity and fluency of the output summary. In addition, the encoder-decoder model enables the accurate summary generation process, vastly improving fluency and accuracy. Furthermore, the experimental outcomes show that the Generative Artificial Intelligence Sequence to sequence the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers model surpasses the conventional text summarization techniques concerning Bilingual Evaluation Understudy of 0.71 and Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering of 0.73, which shows that the proposed model generates a meaningful summary from the given text."

Unequal learning preparation commonly exists among learners with varying socioeconomic and academic backgrounds, and can further exacerbate the educational divide. By reducing learning cost and providing less prepared learners with personalized delivery of information and knowledge, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) may help mitigate disparities in learning preparation. In this study, we investigate the roles of learners' use of GenAI in their learning processes, considering varying levels of learners’ prior learning preparation and proficiency in GenAI use. Specifically, we examine the effects of the use of GenAI tools on learning outcomes through its impacts on perceived informational benefit, learning cost, and knowledge fit in the focal learning process, moderated by learning preparation and GenAI proficiency of learners. Based on an experiment in a programming learning context, we find that although GenAI use significantly reduces learning cost, especially for less prepared learners, the cost reduction effect has not been translated into improved learning outcomes. We find no significant moderating effects of learning preparation on how GenAI use affects informational benefit and knowledge fit, further showing that GenAI tools have not yet been effectively utilized to help less prepared learners or reduce the educational divide. As indicated by the significant moderating roles of GenAI proficiency, to fully leverage the power of GenAI, improving GenAI proficiency can be crucial to ensure learning effectiveness for learners with different levels of learning preparation."

Findings GenAI chatbots’ responses were found to perform medium-to-high in terms of relevance, accuracy, specificity and justification. For the UK sample, the amount of investment had a marginal effect but prompt timing had an interesting impact. Unlike the British sample, the GenAI application, prompt timing and investment amount did not significantly influence the Bulgarian respondents’ evaluations.

The first was a survey comprising demographic and metaphor-related questions, and the second involved metaphor checking, in which participants provided screenshots of their interactions with GenAI. The data, which were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively, yielded 53 unique metaphors for the concept of GenAI in academic writing. We divided these into four conceptual categories in what we term the 4T Pyramid Model: Technical Support (representative metaphor: high-heeled shoes), Text Development (compass), Transformative Potential (Spider-Man), and Threat (drug).

While recent studies have demonstrated GAI's promising capabilities in processing static emotional content, the frontier of dynamic social cognition – where multiple modalities converge to create naturalistic social scenarios – remained largely unexplored. This study advances our understanding by examining the social-cognitive capabilities of Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro model through its performance on the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC), a sophisticated instrument designed to evaluate mentalization abilities using dynamic audiovisual stimuli. We compared the model's performance to a human normative sample (N = 1230) across varying temperature settings (a parameter controlling the level of randomness in the AI's output, where lower values lead to more deterministic responses and higher values increase variability; set at 0, 0.5, and 1). Results revealed that Gemini 1.5 Pro consistently performed above chance across all conditions (all corrected ps < 0.001, Cohen's h range = 1.17–1.41) and significantly outperformed the human sample mean (Z = 2.24, p = .025; Glass's Δ = 0.92, 95 \% CI [0.11, 1.72]; Hedges' g = 0.92, 95 \% CI [0.12, 1.72]).

These findings extend our understanding of artificial social cognition to complex multimodal processing while raising important questions about the nature of machine-based social understanding. The implications span theoretical considerations in artificial Theory of Mind to practical applications in mental health care and social skills training, though careful consideration is warranted regarding the fundamental differences between human and artificial social cognitive processing."

However, its current research landscape remains fragmented, with limited synthesis of trends and unclear pathways for adoption in the construction industry. To address these gaps, a mixed-method review is conducted, combining bibliometric analysis to quantitatively map research trends with qualitative thematic synthesis for in-depth contextual insights. A total of 148 publications were retrieved from Scopus and Google Scholar (2014–2024). The bibliometric analysis identified 49 high-frequency keywords, grouped into six thematic clusters, characterizing the quantitative research landscape. Complementing this, the qualitative synthesis examined five dominant application domains: (1) proactive safety monitoring and risk prevention, (2) generative AI for sustainable construction, (3) automating design through generative intelligence, (4) construction education, and (5) construction management, within which key research gaps and practical challenges are critically examined. Building upon these insights, the study proposes four-level research roadmap spanning (1) industry-level considerations, (2) organizational and stakeholder perspectives, (3) project-level perspectives, and (4) technological integration. Unlike prior reviews that concentrated on isolated single-model technologies or narrowly defined domains, this study offers a comprehensive, cross-domain analysis of generative AI for construction. By employing a mixed-method review—integrating quantitative bibliometric mapping and qualitative thematic synthesis—it bridges technical, organizational, and implementation perspectives to deliver a holistic understanding of the field.

In this study, an intelligent predictive framework using a generative artificial intelligence model is presented, which predicts the gas sensitivity of target materials with remarkable speed and accuracy. To validate the proposed framework, a material database is constructed using ZnO doped with eight different metal atoms, which serves as representative materials. Subsequently, 25 physical parameters, including crystal structure and electronic structure, are calculated using first-principles calculations. Eight intelligent learning models are then trained to predict sensitivity, with the Extremely Randomized Trees model performing the best, achieving a mean square error of 0.02. By combining feature engineering with generative artificial intelligence models, a novel model based on intrinsic atomic features (radius, electronegativity, first ionization energy) is developed, which enables the prediction of CO gas sensitivity in doped ZnO using the generated 12 key parameters, without any parameters from first principle calculation, thus significantly reducing the time and cost associated with discovering gas-sensitive properties. This predictive framework can be easily extended to other materials, facilitating the functional development of materials."

To estimate the short- and medium-term effects, we use a variety of methods, including a difference-in-discontinuity approach exploiting the exogenous nature of the unanticipated launch of ChatGPT in 2022. There is a strong short- and medium-term decline in the intensity of searches for vacancies, indicating a notable reduction in the supply of young people actively seeking apprenticeships and suggesting great uncertainty among the affected cohort. Occupations with a high proportion of cognitive tasks and with high demands on language skills were particularly affected by the decline. Interestingly, the revealed preferences in the search behavior of young job seekers contrasted with previous expert assessments on the automation risks of occupations and aligned with the most recent assessments of the AI and language model exposure of occupations – before these new assessments existed. Notably, while the supply decline did not reduce the number of signed apprenticeship contracts, we find evidence of declining applicant quality, particularly for commercial employees, the most widely offered apprenticeship in Switzerland."

However, it is certain that AI is here to stay, and it is crucial that educators embrace this technology and teach students to use this resource carefully and wisely. Communication is an essential component in nursing practice and cultivating competent writing skills is a vital aspect of nursing education. However, nursing students struggle with scholarly writing especially at the undergraduate level. Integrating generative artificial intelligence into a writing intensive course offers a unique approach to aid students in improving their writing. In this pilot project, students were given an assignment to actively engage with generative artificial intelligence and critically analyze the response using current nursing literature to support or refute the output. This assignment was used to springboard class discussion on advantages and disadvantages of using artificial intelligence for scholarly writing. This novel approach has the potential to build confidence and competence in novice writers which supports their success in nursing school and in clinical practice."

It is an emerging area where research and education face new challenges as new knowledge keeps coming in. During this process, generative artificial intelligence (GAI) plays a critical role in education and research activities. However, GAI's impact on smart energy systems research and education is less discussed. Especially, its impact on education is rarely discussed when compared to research. GAI reshapes both the research process and the roles of teachers and students in the course. This perspective offers insights into the ongoing research and education paradigm shifts observed in the smart energy system. This perspective synthesizes existing studies on "GAI for Science" and "GAI for Education" practices in the field of smart energy systems. In research, the impact of GAI is discussed from both macro and micro levels. In education, this perspective examines how a GAI-driven teaching approach addresses the challenges of teaching smart energy systems compared to the traditional approach. This perspective could benefit the discussion of GAI-reshaped research and education in energy science.}

This review article looks into the uses and effects of generative artificial intelligence in psychology. We employed a systematic selection process, encompassing papers published between 2015 and 2024 from databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore, using keywords like “Generative AI in psychology” “ChatGPT and behavior modeling” and “AI in mental health”. First, the paper goes over the fundamental ideas of generative AI and lists its uses in data analysis, behavior modeling, and social interaction simulation. A detailed comparison table has been added to contrast conventional research methodologies with GenAI-based approaches in psychology studies. Next, analyzing the theoretical and ethical issues that generative AI raises for psychological research, it highlights how crucial it is to develop a coherent theoretical framework. This study illustrates the benefits of generative AI in handling vast amounts of data and increasing research efficiency by contrasting traditional research methods with AI-driven methodologies. Regarding particular uses, the study explores how generative AI might be used to simulate social interactions, analyze massive amounts of text, and learn about cognitive processes. Section 5 has been expanded to include discussions on political biases, geographic biases, and other biases. In conclusion, the paper looks forward to the future development of generative AI in psychology research and suggests techniques for improving it. We have included methodological solutions such as the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach and human-in-the-loop systems, as well as data privacy solutions like open-source local LLMs. In summary, generative AI has the potential to revolutionize psychological research, but in order to maintain the moral and scientific integrity of the field, ethical and theoretical concerns must be carefully considered before applying the technology."

In order to overcome the limitations of traditional journal cover design and enhance the artistic quality and communicative effectiveness of journal covers, this study proposes a method for designing international scientific journal covers driven by artificial intelligence. The method integrates numerous generative artificial intelligence technologies and multi-criteria decision-making methods, applying them to the design practice of food science journals, thereby improving the efficiency of journal cover design and publication. The integrated method first uses the coding method of grounded theory to extract five design dimensions critical to journal cover design and constructs a triple-mapping relationship model of technological translatability, visual expressiveness, and alignment with public cognition and cultural background, providing a research foundation for organizing design elements to align with the journal’s positioning. The DeepSeek large language model is employed to generate creative keywords for the journal cover, which are then translated into descriptive instructions recognizable by Midjourney. Subsequently, Midjourney is used to generate preliminary cover sketches to quickly visualise the creative concept, and the controlnet function of Stable Diffusion is employed to control the outline of the sketch’s line art, followed by experimentation and optimisation across dimensions such as visual style and tonal range. Finally, the VIKOR method is applied to evaluate and rank the six generated cover design proposals. The evaluation criteria encompass scientific content expression, visual aesthetics, and communication and acceptance, across three dimensions with fifteen indicators. The selected design proposals are then subjected to collaborative optimisation between human input and artificial intelligence. The integrated method offers a systematic and innovative framework, enhancing the efficiency, creativity, and visual impact of journal cover design, and provides both theoretical and practical references for future academic publishing."

This paper proposes a generative artificial intelligence (AI) embedded thermodynamic modeling method of GTs for adaptive performance matching. Possible component performance curves are automatically generated by the variational autoencoder in the shape view. Speed-dependent map sampling coefficients of the curves are introduced to realize fast matching of various operating conditions. The proposed method is verified on 2 different types of in-service GTs in the industrial field with mean absolute percentage error 0.5\% and 0.54\%, respectively. The maximum reduction of performance prediction error is 2.37\% compared to traditional methods. The proposed method can realize high-precision GT performance adaptive prediction with good generalization and applicability, thus providing guidance for high efficiency operation control and health management. This paper shows an interpretable and reliable approach for the integration of AI with thermodynamics. Following the proposed generative-embedded modeling paradigm, performance prediction of other complex energy systems can also benefit."

In the era of developed information technology systems, the dynamics of knowledge creation and dissemination have also changed. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)—an embedded entity in the knowledge management system—has become a prominent area of research nowadays, while accountability, transparency, and ethics are common research agendas in institutional economics related to GenAI. The research in this paper has investigated the convictions behind GenAI adoption and how to develop a GenAI governance framework. The research adopts a qualitative approach to investigate the problem and surveys undergraduate students to explore their motive for using GenAI. The study sheds analytical light on institutional economists’ view on the governance of GenAI. The study has found a positive relationship between perceived benefits and the adoption of GenAI in education by students. The theoretical model will have a considerable impact on the ongoing debate on the governance of GenAI and knowledge management systems."

The initial reactions from educators have drawn a mixed response about the application of GenAI in management education, where some consider it a ‘watershed’ phenomenon, while others consider it an ‘existential threat’ to the teaching-learning system. Subscribing to the positive view, this paper argues that educators must promote the responsible use of AI-based tools, and imposing any artificial restraint on the application of GenAI technology can be deleterious to students' advancement. This is because GenAI will automate future jobs and create new jobs that do not exist today. As organizations are moving towards skill-based hiring, management education must prepare graduates with the requisite technical and human skills required for future jobs. However, previous studies have invested a lot of attention towards the technical aspect of the integration of GenAI tools by recommending capacity development programs to understand the nuances of new technology. However, they have overlooked the important aspect of adopting technology, i.e., attitudes and behavioral rigidities among educators. For this purpose, we argue that to overcome such a rigid mindset, institutions must focus on an unlearning mechanism comprising three phases: destabilizing triggers, discarding existing practices, and experimenting with new ones to help educators adopt GenAI tools in the education system. This study offers multiple theoretical and practical implications. It is a response to a call from researchers to apply existing theories to inform management scholarship about the implementation of GenAI technology and overcome educators' apprehensions that impede the ethical application of GenAI in management education."

Findings draw a detailed picture of the state of GenAI research. In total, 170 published articles are reviewed based on topics, theories, and methods. Three main topic clusters are identified: 1) antecedents of using GenAI; 2) impacts and applications of GenAI; and 3) technicalities of GenAI. Theoretically, most studies have borrowed foundations from other fields without substantial development. Methodologically, existing research—particularly in tourism—has tended to feature quantitative techniques. This research also compares business and tourism literature based on an antecedents, process and outcomes framework, outlining potential research gaps and opportunities. In addition to synthesizing the current research landscape, this paper presents a multidimensional framework (i.e., theories, contexts, characteristics, and methods – TCCM) that suggests multiple future research questions to inform GenAI studies in tourism."

The focus is to see how the information type, model complexity, and prompt structure collectively affect the collaboration. A set of case studies demonstrate that a modular modeling approach with low-level information improves prompt efficiency and modeling accuracy, especially in complex scenarios. This strategy also enables novice and expert users to collaborate with GenAI in solving challenging real-world CAD tasks effectively.

Moreover, little research has explored whether and why consumers are willing to use GAI to generate online reviews. By conducting two experiments, this study investigates how consumers respond differently to GAI-generated reviews versus human-generated reviews and identifies potential factors that influence consumers’ willingness to use GAI to generate reviews. Findings indicate that although there is no significant difference in consumers’ perceptions between human-generated and GAI-generated reviews in terms of review credibility, review richness, and review usefulness, only half of the participants are willing to use GAI to generate reviews. Further analysis results suggest that individuals who consider GAI unethical tend to avoid using GAI. Those with high personal innovativeness are more willing to use GAI to generate online reviews. Our findings deepen the understanding of consumer attitudes toward GAI-generated reviews and provide implications for the deployment of GAI in the online review system."

It uses an extension of the technology acceptance model (TAM) with a modified framework that incorporates two key factors: self-efficacy and subjective norm. Data were collected from a sample of 367 primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong using questionnaires containing items for six constructs: self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude towards using, subjective norm, and behavioural intention. The results show that fostering teachers' self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, and attitude is essential for successfully increasing their behavioural intention to use GenAI tools. Subjective norm was also found to influence teachers' behavioural intention. To enhance teachers' effective use of GenAI for teaching, teacher development programmes should focus on equipping teachers with comprehensive conceptual knowledge and skills and an understanding of the application of these tools to teaching and learning. Policy support to create a conducive environment for the use of GenAI in teaching and learning would also be beneficial.

The 3D preform shape is simplified by expressing it in a two-dimensional manner based on the geometric features of the forged shape. A beta-variational autoencoder (β-VAE) serves as the generative model, paired with a surrogate model using deep neural networks (DNN) to explore and optimise preform geometries efficiently. The initial training dataset for the generative model is created using isosurfaces derived from Laplace’s equation. A multi-objective optimisation framework is developed to minimise forging load and flash volume and mitigate underfill and lap defects. Preforms were designed using this method and validated through forging experiments on two target geometries: a brake calliper and an electric vehicle (EV) manifold. The forging results of the optimised preforms were compared with traditional isosurface methods, demonstrating that the proposed method reduces forging load and flash volume while preventing underfill and lap defects. This integrated approach combines advanced computational techniques with practical validation, offering a systematic and adaptable solution for the challenges associated with 3D preform design in forging processes."

This extension fills gaps in our understanding of the psychosocial factors influencing the adoption of GenAI tools in higher education. We used a questionnaire and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze data collected from 257 French management science students across different institutions. The results show that the most significant factors are performance expectancy, habit, hedonic motivation, and trust. These factors explain 49.3\% of the intention to use GenAI tools, 58.7\% of the intention to adopt them, and 39.6\% of the intention to recommend them.

By leveraging GAI to analyze International Patent Classification (IPC) definitions and benchmark reports, we developed a system that rapidly generates technology-function matrices, significantly reducing the time required for manual analysis. The method was applied to 2,399 quantum technology patents from 2023 to March 2024, covering four key areas: secure communications, computing, quantum simulators, and sensors. This approach not only aids government agencies in identifying new technological opportunities but also facilitates the industrialization of potential technologies. By combining GAI with established analytical frameworks, this study contributes to both the theoretical understanding and practical application of patent analysis in emerging fields."

Though a focus for this emerging technology is academic misconduct, we sought to leverage GenAI in curriculum structure to facilitate educational outcomes. For instructors, GenAI offers new opportunities in course design and management while reducing time requirements to evaluate outcomes and personalizing learner feedback. These include innovative instructional designs such as flipped classrooms and gamification, enriching teaching methodologies with focused and interactive approaches, and team-based exercise development among others. For learners, GenAI offers unprecedented self-directed learning opportunities, improved cognitive engagement, and effective retrieval practices, leading to enhanced autonomy, motivation, and knowledge retention. Though empowering, this evolving landscape has integration challenges and ethical considerations, including accuracy, technological evolution, loss of learner’s voice, and socioeconomic disparities. Our experience demonstrates that the responsible application of GenAI’s in educational settings will revolutionize learning practices, making education more accessible and tailored, producing positive motivational outcomes for both learners and instructors. Thus, we argue that leveraging GenAI in educational settings will improve outcomes with implications extending from primary through higher and continuing education paradigms."

    abstract = "The image conversion of clothing sketches has enormous application value in fields such as visual editing, clothing design, and human-computer interaction. At present, most of the objects converted from sketches are relatively simple shapes, such as faces, human postures, animal postures, shoes, and bags. At present, sketch conversion-based work is difficult to handle images with complex texture structures, making it challenging to solve the task of image conversion for clothing sketches. Additionally, the lack of clothing datasets is also a difficult problem to solve. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes using an edge detection algorithm to generate clothing simulation sketches in reverse, solving the problem of missing clothing sketch datasets. Then, combined with generative adversarial networks in the field of artificial intelligence, the Cloth Sketch GAN (CSG) network framework is proposed. It improves the generator and discriminator on the basis of the pix2pix network, and enhances the image generation effect by adding an attention module in the generator of the U-Net network structure. Two scales of discriminators are used to discriminate the images separately, and multiple layers of feature extraction are introduced based on the two scales of discriminators. The design of the feature matching loss function and perception loss function is added to make the generated images more realistic and clear, thus completing the conversion from clothing sketch to clothing image. Applied research. Finally, experiments were conducted on the clothing dataset constructed in this article, and the results showed that Cloth Sketch GAN had a significant improvement in the performance of generating clothing images. Moreover, with the improved network proposed in this article, the task of converting clothing sketches to real clothing images can be effectively accomplished on the clothing dataset.",

Subsequently, artificial intelligence techniques were utilized to evaluate the reliability of the results by analyzing error characteristics. This approach differed from traditional artificial intelligence methods by incorporating generative adversarial network-based data set expansion technology and a multi-scale fusion neural network model.

However, social media content is diverse in its form - text, image, audio, and video. Depending on the nature of the applications, it may be desirable to convert all these forms into a unique format to ease processing. Once the data is converted into text, it is then possible to organize it into structured tabular data to feed Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for real-time terrorist attack detections. This paper explores using the emerging Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) tools for converting social media content (text, image, audio or video) into text format suitable for applying machine learning algorithms. The methodology of this research consisted of studying existing Gen AI tools, evaluating and selecting the best among those that offer API or code integration to implement a tool for converting all forms of social media content into text. The main limitation of this work is the small size of the datasets used in the tools' evaluation. The design and implementation of the proposed solution have been completed, and the tool is ready for use and integration into a framework for collecting and analysing social media content to fight against terrorism.",

In this study, a human-centered learning and teaching framework that uses generative AI tools for self-regulated learning development through domain knowledge learning was proposed to catalyze changes in educational practices. The framework illustrates how generative AI tools can revolutionize educational practices and transform the processes of teaching and learning to become human-centered. It emphasizes the evolving roles of teachers, who increasingly become skillful facilitators and humanistic storytellers who craft differentiated instructions and attempt to develop students’ individualized learning. Drawing upon insights from neuroscience, the framework guides students to employ generative AI tools to augment their attentiveness, stimulate active engagement in learning, receive immediate feedback, and encourage self-reflection. The pedagogical approach is also reimagined; teachers equipped with generative AI tools and AI literacy can refine their teaching strategies to better equip students to meet future challenges. The practical application of the framework is demonstrated in a case study involving the development of Chinese language writing ability among primary students within a K–12 educational context. This article also reports the results of a 60-h development programme for teachers. Specifically, providing in-service teachers with cases involving uses of the proposed framework helped them to better understand the generative AI concepts and integrate them into their teaching and learning and increased their perceived ability to design AI-integrated courses that would enhance students’ attention, engagement, confidence, and satisfaction.",

    abstract = "The manufacturing sector is in a challenging spot. Confronted with persistent cost pressures, supply chain instability, and disruptive technologies like as 3D printing and the Internet of Things. The industry must consistently optimise processes, enhance efficiency, and improve overall equipment performance. Simultaneously, there is a significant surge in sustainability and energy transition. Manufacturers are being urged to decrease their carbon emissions, embrace circular economy principles, and enhance their overall environmental sustainability. Manufacturers are under pressure to consistently innovate while still assuring stability and safety. An erroneous AI forecast in a marketing campaign may cause small inconvenience, whereas an erroneous AI forecast on a manufacturing shopfloor can have catastrophic consequences. Manufacturers are familiar with technology and disruption, but the main issue is that what is effective in principle often proves unsuccessful in practice. As producers, we have established a knowledge base; nevertheless, it is difficult for users to locate information efficiently as it requires extensive time and effort to search and navigate through the contents. Alternatively, we can establish a data lake that may rapidly deteriorate into a data swamp. Alternatively, we can continue to incorporate other applications, so perpetuating the growth of our technological debt. However, we are now incapable of updating our applications due to the presence of intricate and long-standing logic within them. The implementation requirements and applications of generative artificial intelligence differ from those of analytical AI. Analytical artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used for the purposes of predicting future events, optimising desired values, and utilising past data to enhance processes and results. Gen AI represents a new opportunity for problem solutions, as demonstrated by recent advancements in content production, insight generation, and human-like engagement. There is an urgent need for additional scholarly research to gain a deeper understanding of how Gen-AI technologies are being adopted and spread across different industries in production systems. This study represents a preliminary attempt to investigate the current utilisation of Gen-AI by corporations, as well as the advantages and difficulties it entails, and the anticipated future of these technologies.",

In addition, realistic data is adversarially generated by training a generator and a discriminator. Then, through these models, the generated financial data or audit data can be compared with real data to identify potential risks. Finally, this study conducts experiments with sample data. The experimental results show that the generative model performs well in capturing the mean characteristics of the data. The false positive rate of the original generated data is 0.08, and the improved generated data is reduced to 0.04, showing the excellent performance of the improved model in reducing false positives.",

In particular, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), as the main technologies that form the basis of artificial intelligence, have offered revolutionary innovations and laid the foundation for future technologies. Traditional artificial intelligence models are based on algorithms that show high performance in certain tasks such as classification, scoring, prediction, and pattern recognition. These algorithms are developed to best perform a specific task, making it difficult for artificial intelligence to be sufficiently effective in areas that require flexibility. Generative artificial intelligence, which has become widespread in recent years, has the ability to produce certain types of content in addition to the competencies of traditional artificial intelligence models. This has revolutionized the field of productivity in artificial intelligence. Generative artificial intelligence language models have gone beyond the limitations and started a new era in artificial intelligence applications. Where traditional artificial intelligence models are limited, language models have come into play, especially with their natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. Rather than just analyzing data, language models can learn the rules of the language and provide human-like responses, produce text, and offer a wider range of applications. In this way, artificial intelligence systems have become more flexible, extensible, and dynamic. With the rise of language models in this field, concepts such as large language models (LLM) and small language models (SLM) have emerged. Large language models have come to the fore as systems that can provide deep knowledge and language production on a wide variety of topics by being trained on huge data sets. Large language models such as ChatGPT are one of the most common and impressive examples in this field. However, small language models, which are smaller and specialized language models, have begun to be used as an alternative to large language models in certain areas because they require less data and processing power. Small language models stand out with their lighter but targeted performance, offering effective solutions, especially in situations where there are resource limitations. At this point, using both large and small versions of language models in the right scenarios provides great advantages in terms of sustainability and efficiency. This study aims to reveal the transformative effect of technology on artificial intelligence and the critical role of language models in this process by evaluating language models and the issues to be considered in the selection of these models.",

    abstract = "An antenna inverse design scheme based on generative artificial intelligence (AI) is proposed. The generative AI uses a diffusion model and incorporates a transformer model to output a series of innovative and practical antenna structures according to the input antenna requirements. To select the optimal structure from a large set of candidates, we further incorporate the Characteristic Mode Analysis (CMA) method into the Bilinear Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNN) model for evaluation and selection. The antenna inverse design scheme cleverly combines AI with the CMA method, which greatly simplifies the tedious process of traditional antenna design. By simply inputting the antenna requirements, the optimal antenna structure, distinct from existing datasets, can be rapidly obtained. Since the output is an antenna structure, it is not limited to a specific frequency band, thus offering design flexibility for cross-band adjustments. This letter presents case studies on single-band, dual-band, and wideband circularly polarized microstrip antennas to validate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

Computer vision is an emerging discipline, and applying generative artificial intelligence technology to image processing is an important entry point in current machine vision research. When generating images, this article utilized adversarial learning mechanisms to optimize the parameters of the generator and discriminator, creating a competitive relationship between the two and gradually improving the quality of the generated images. Adversarial training methods were used in video processing to optimize the generated model, enabling it to map between different styles and achieve style transfer. The generative adversarial network was optimized using a cyclic consistency loss function to ensure consistency of video content before and after editing. Based on the trained recurrent generative adversarial network, style transformation and content editing on the video were performed. The PSNR value of generated image 3 was 27.1; the PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio) value of the original image was 27.8; the SSIM (Structural Similarity) value of the generated image was 0.95; the SSIM value of the original image was 1.00. The PSNR and SSIM values of the generated image with image number 3 in the experiment were relatively high and close to the corresponding values of the original image. This article provided a reference for the research on the application of generative artificial intelligence in visual effects.",

Although LLMs excel at text generation, they struggle with business-related data that is tabular and has challenges with categorisation, regression, and prediction. In fact, the SAP Foundation Model can compete with and even surpass these conventional methods while providing the flexibility of foundation models; in contrast, state-of-the-art LLMs perform 20-50\% worse than incumbent restricted AI approaches in comparable cases.

Developed by OpenAI, the generative artificial intelligence model, ChatGPT, has attracted considerable attention and sparked extensive debate since its launch. This study, taking ChatGPT as an exemplar, explores the prospective applications of generative artificial intelligence in English education based on its four core competences: text generation, contextual dialogue understanding, sequential task accomplishment, and programming language interpretation capabilities. The inquiry probes into ChatGPT’s potential to augment students’ English proficiency across all linguistic abilities, encompassing listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Furthermore, this research offers a preliminary validation of the feasibility of implementing generative artificial intelligence within English education through specific instructional tasks such as syllabus creation, self-learning support, and pedagogical feedback from three aspects: educational subject, educational object, and educational process. Additionally, this paper delves into the merits of employing artificial intelligence in the realm of education, hoping to furnish more insights for future inquiries.",

To further increase the performance of CNC controllers, this work proposes an novel method based on the use of generative adversarial networks (GAN) for the direct generation of tool paths within the CNC controllers. We present a concept that enables interpolation with GAN. Based on this, a novel system architecture for the integration of GAN into an AI-module within CNC controls is developed. The new method is evaluated on the basis of an example contour. GAN trained to generate linear toolpaths are used for evaluation. A smoothing GAN is used to blend the sharp path transitions between the generated path segments.",

While numerous RSs have been proposed and successfully implemented across various domains, traditional AI-based RSs still encounter certain challenges, such as data sparsity, cold start, and diversity. Generative Artificial Intelligence in recommender systems is a recent advancement used by platforms like Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon to recommend items, news, videos, audios, goods, and services to their customers/users or to personalize experiences for their customers/users. The main purpose of this review is to compare traditional AI-based recommender systems with generative AI-based recommender systems. A total of fifty-two (52) papers, published between 2019 and February 2024, were selected from six major online libraries. To get a more comprehensive understanding of the selected study, we reviewed the selected studies techniques, and the models, datasets, and metrics used. Our systematic review reveals that generative AI models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoder (VAEs) and autoencoders have been widely used in recommender systems and they perform better than traditional AI techniques. Among the 30 datasets analyzed, MovieLens was the most frequently used, accounting for 33\%, while Amazon datasets accounted for 11\%, Recall and RSME are the most commonly used metrics. Our literature review offers understandings into the Generative AI techniques used across different recommender systems and provides suggestions for the future research. Finally, we elaborated on open issues and discussed current and future trends in generative AI-based recommendation systems.",

At the same time, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are used to create new patterns and color combinations and enhance the diversity of design, while ChatGPT is used to parse user needs and transform text descriptions into design concepts. In the process of implementing these methods, this paper collects and analyzes user data to build user portraits to understand their preferences and needs. This paper also uses a style transfer algorithm to combine user-favorite elements with design templates to generate preliminary design sketches. Then GAN intervenes to generate new design elements and uses these elements to enrich and refine the design content. During the design process, the artificial intelligence model is continuously optimized based on user feedback to ensure that the final output design not only meets the user's personalized needs but is also highly innovative and attractive. Ultimately, these individually adjusted designs are output in an appropriate format for application in actual products or services. Based on comparative experiments, this paper found that personalized design is superior to traditional design methods in multiple key indicators: the average innovation score of personalized design is as high as 9.06, higher than the 6.89 of traditional design; the time required for personalized design is mainly concentrated between 20 and 30 minutes, while the time required for traditional design ranges from 30 to nearly 50 minutes and fluctuates greatly; the adoption rate of personalized design reaches a minimum of 90.2\% and a maximum of 99.9\%, while the adoption rate of traditional design is lower, with a minimum of only 75.2\% and a maximum of only 88.7\%.

The generation model with strong learning ability is used to improve the accuracy of expected signal frequency estimation in the spectrum of noisy signal, and further improve the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio in the signal bandwidth. The experimental results show that, by training the generative adversarial network, the received signals in the direction of - 45° to 45° of the receiving antenna show good noise reduction effect, and the accuracy rate can reach above 90\%.",

This revolutionary technology has enabled the analysis, recognition, and interpretation of images in ways that were previously inconceivable. An investigation into the most recent developments in artificial intelligence techniques that have improved the efficiency and precision of image processing tasks is presented in this study. We survey the emergence of transformer architectures and the integration of deep learning models, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to explore how these technologies have transformed the understanding and application of images in several industries. An overview of existing image processing methods and the limits of those approaches is presented at the beginning of our research. This highlights the necessity of more advanced AI-driven solutions. After that, we examine the advancements that have been made in artificial intelligence, such as the incorporation of attention processes, the development of more effective CNN architectures, and the utilisation of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for the purpose of picture synthesis and augmentation. The purpose of this research is to investigate the impact that artificial intelligence has on particular applications of image processing, such as autonomous car navigation systems, facial recognition, medical imaging, and satellite images analysis. Specifically, we focus on the enhancements in diagnostic accuracy, environmental monitoring, security, and safety that arose as a result of the adoption of artificial intelligence in these sectors through the use of case studies. Furthermore, we discuss the issues that are associated with artificial intelligence in image processing. These challenges include the necessity for explainable AI models, the requirement for computational resources, and the protection of data privacy. A number of potential solutions to these problems are proposed by us, including federated learning and the creation of artificial intelligence systems that are more open to scrutiny. Lastly, we come to a conclusion by predicting future developments in artificial intelligence for image processing. These developments include the ability of AI to offer more personalised and adaptable image processing solutions, as well as the integration of AI with edge computing for real-time image analysis.

Physical jobs such as building, assembly line work, cleaning, and so on are (by and large) unaffected by the wave of GenAI transformation. But combine GenAI with robots and that may change. GenAI can help us tackle some of the biggest problems on the planet. Yes, GenAI can be used to draft a funny speech for our friend's wedding, or come up with an idea for tonight's supper. But it can also be used to address issues like climate change, massive inequality, hunger, access to healthcare, and more. It can help us find new treatments for diseases.</p>",

Utilizing a hybrid structural equation modeling and artificial neural network approach, we analyzed data collected from 1048 university students to evaluate the developed model. Our findings revealed that while perceived behavioral control has an insignificant impact on generative AI use, attitudes emerge as the most critical factor, further reinforced by the significant role of subjective norms. Perceived anthropomorphism, perceived intelligence, and perceived animacy were also found to influence students’ attitudes significantly. More importantly, the findings supported the role of generative AI in positively affecting social sustainability, aligning with the principles of T-EESST.

Traditional Fashion Recommendation Systems (FRSs) limits their ability to scale and adapt the ever growing styles as they heavily rely on manual design. Fashion can also be so inclusive, expressive and sustainable. Appropriate recommendations given by FRS helps to enhance user satisfaction and makes it more enjoyable and accessible. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have revolutionized FRS enabling them to consume beyond conventional methods by taking in contextual data, user preferences and visual content for recommendations with a more individualized suggestion. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a potent technique to enhance these systems by generating diverse fashion designs with high fidelity. In this paper, a systematic review of parameters used to evaluate FRS using Generative Algorithms is discussed. Various parameters to evaluate system performance and the recommendation quality are analyzed. Detailed analysis of the input parameters, to be considered to design the efficient AI based FRS (AI-FRS) is also presented.

    abstract = "Despite the myriad peer-reviewed papers demonstrating novel Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based solutions to COVID-19 challenges during the pandemic, few have made a significant clinical impact, especially in diagnosis and disease precision staging. One major cause for such low impact is the lack of model transparency, significantly limiting the AI adoption in real clinical practice. To solve this problem, AI models need to be explained to users. Thus, we have conducted a comprehensive study of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) using PRISMA technology. Our findings suggest that XAI can improve model performance, instill trust in the users, and assist users in decision-making. In this systematic review, we introduce common XAI techniques and their utility with specific examples of their application. We discuss the evaluation of XAI results because it is an important step for maximizing the value of AI-based clinical decision support systems. Additionally, we present the traditional, modern, and advanced XAI models to demonstrate the evolution of novel techniques. Finally, we provide a best practice guideline that developers can refer to during the model experimentation. We also offer potential solutions with specific examples for common challenges in AI model experimentation. This comprehensive review, hopefully, can promote AI adoption in biomedicine and healthcare.",

    abstract = "Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) models face significant challenges in abstract reasoning tasks, which require deep understanding and generalization across a wide range of domains. This study introduces a novel hybrid multicomponent architecture designed to enhance AGI performance on abstract reasoning tasks. The proposed model integrates advanced techniques including Transformer-based self-attention mechanisms, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Each component addresses distinct aspects of the task: Transformers capture sequence dependencies, GNNs model complex relationships between entities, GANs generate realistic data for training, and RL optimizes reasoning strategies. The synergy of these components allows the model to achieve strong generalization and abstract learning capabilities, significantly improving performance compared to single-component models. The experimental results on the ARC-AGI benchmark demonstrate the superiority of this hybrid approach, with marked improvements in key performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, mean squared error (MSE), and AUC-ROC. These results confirm that the proposed model is a promising solution to overcoming the limitations of current AGI systems in tackling novel and complex reasoning tasks. Future work will focus on further optimization of the model components, expanding its scope to more complex tasks, and evaluating its performance in practical applications such as natural language understanding and robotics.",

    abstract = "Today, numerical controls (CNC) are the standard for the control of machine tools and industrial robots in production and enable highly flexible and efficient production, especially for frequently changing production tasks. A numerical control has discrete inputs and outputs. Within the NC channel, however, it is necessary to analytically describe curves for the calculation of the position setpoints and the jerk limitation. The resulting change between discrete and continuous description forms and the considerable restrictions in the parallelisation of the interpolation of continuous curves within the NC channel lead to a performance overhead that limits the performance of the NC channel with regard to the calculation of new position setpoints. This can lead to a drop in production speed and thus to longer production times. To solve this problem, we propose a new approach in this paper. This is based on the use of deep generative models and allows the direct generation of interpolated toolpaths without calculation of continuous curves and subsequent discretization. The generative models are being trained to create curves of certain types such as linear and parabolic curves or splines directly as discrete point sequences. This approach is very well feasible with regard to its parallelization and reduces the computing effort within the NC channel. First results with straight lines and parabolic curves show the feasibility of this new approach for the generation of CNC toolpaths.",

Enormous genetic alterations in cancer can be captured through next-generation sequencing. The analysis of high-dimensional data from sequencing experiments requires a huge amount of computational power, which can be addressed using algorithms in artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML). Early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have been instrumental in clinical research due to its ability to assist clinicians to make a more informed treatment decision. The visualization of tumor growth and its genetic cause is an essential part of cancer treatment. Here, AI/ML can address this by analyzing and linking the image-derived data to genomics data from cancer patients. In this work, we present a review of recent advances in image analysis using ML/AI for cancer diagnosis and treatment. In addition to that, we have discussed the recent methods of genomic data analysis for cancer classification and biomarker discovery.",

By introducing generative design tools, machine learning algorithms and sentiment analysis technology, this study evaluates the role of AI in improving design efficiency, personalizing user experience, increasing creativity and enhancing emotional resonance of users. In the evaluation of design effect, it is found that the effect score is significantly improved after the introduction of AI in each design stage. The design scheme generated by the designer through AI is more in line with the needs of users, the design accuracy is improved, and the creativity is also increased compared with the traditional design. In terms of personalized user experience, we use machine learning algorithm to adjust interface elements according to user behavior to provide a more personalized user experience. The experimental results show that personalized design can significantly improve user satisfaction and interaction efficiency. Through the emotional analysis technology, the language and emotional tone of the design are adjusted, and the emotional resonance of users is improved.

    abstract = "As we transition from the 5G epoch, a new horizon beckons with the advent of 6G, seeking a profound fusion with novel communication paradigms and emerging technological trends, bringing once-futuristic visions to life along with added technical intricacies. Although analytical models lay the foundations and offer systematic insights, we have recently witnessed a noticeable surge in research suggesting machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can efficiently deal with complex problems by complementing or replacing model-based approaches. The majority of data-driven wireless research leans heavily on discriminative AI (DAI) that requires vast real-world datasets. Unlike the DAI, Generative AI (GenAI) pertains to generative models (GMs) capable of discerning the underlying data distribution, patterns, and features of the input data. This makes GenAI a crucial asset in wireless domain wherein real-world data is often scarce, incomplete, costly to acquire, and hard to model or comprehend. With these appealing attributes, GenAI can replace or supplement DAI methods in various capacities. Accordingly, this combined tutorial-survey paper commences with preliminaries of 6G and wireless intelligence by outlining candidate 6G applications and services, presenting a taxonomy of state-of-the-art DAI models, exemplifying prominent DAI use cases, and elucidating the multifaceted ways through which GenAI enhances DAI. Subsequently, we present a tutorial on GMs by spotlighting seminal examples such as generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, flow-based GMs, diffusion-based GMs, generative transformers, large language models, autoregressive GMs, to name a few. Contrary to the prevailing belief that GenAI is a nascent trend, our exhaustive review of approximately 120 technical papers demonstrates the scope of research across core wireless research areas, including 1) physical layer design; 2) network optimization, organization, and management; 3) network traffic analytics; 4) cross-layer network security; and 5) localization \& positioning. Furthermore, we outline the central role of GMs in pioneering areas of 6G network research, including semantic communications, integrated sensing and communications, THz communications, extremely large antenna arrays, near-field communications, digital twins, AI-generated content services, mobile edge computing and edge AI, adversarial ML, and trustworthy AI. Lastly, we shed light on the multifarious challenges ahead, suggesting potential strategies and promising remedies. Given its depth and breadth, we are confident that this tutorial-cum-survey will serve as a pivotal reference for researchers and professionals delving into this dynamic and promising domain.",

Human-machine collaborative teaching (HMCT) is a new paradigm that leverages the strengths of both human educators and AI tools to enhance learning outcomes. This study investigates the effectiveness of three human-machine collaborative teaching strategies—directive, guided, and collaborative-implemented in a university—level software engineering course. The experiment involved 99 third-year students and aimed to evaluate the impact of these teaching strategies on creativity and academic performance. The results show that the collaborative teaching method, enhanced by generative AI tools, led to the highest performance in final exams and overall academic achievement, as well as increased participation in extracurricular innovation activities in homework. While directive teaching produced consistent results, it did not foster the same level of engagement or creativity. Guided teaching demonstrated moderate success, but the greatest benefits were observed in the collaborative approach, where students took an active role in their learning. This study suggests that integrating AI into collaborative learning environments can enhance both academic outcomes and student creativity, and recommends expanding the use of AI-supported strategies in higher education. Future research should explore the scalability of these findings across disciplines and investigate long-term impacts on student development and career readiness.",

Based on Weber's dual framework of instrumental rationality and value rationality, combined with Strauss's metaphor of the “second cave” the study systematically analyzes the profound impact of instrumental rationality on the essence of education. While generative AI offers significant advantages in enhancing teaching effectiveness, optimizing resource allocation, and achieving personalized learning, its overuse may lead to the prioritization of utilitarian educational goals and the mechanization of knowledge transmission. In response to this contradiction, the study proposes a “teacher-AI-student” triadic interaction model, emphasizing that the application of technology should adhere to the principles of assistive, transparent, and inclusive use. Innovatively, the study constructs a differentiated educational strategy based on the “learning ability-willingness matrix”, providing precise personalized support for different learners. In the process of digital transformation in education, it is crucial to fully leverage technological advantages while steadfastly adhering to the humanistic values, thereby achieving a dynamic balance between instrumental rationality and value rationality.

    abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are becoming increasingly prevalent in higher education, offering students new opportunities for learning and research. However, concerns about the potential for AI to produce inaccurate or misleading information—commonly referred to as "hallucinations"—have raised questions about the impact of these tools on student learning and academic integrity. This research paper examines how students' awareness of AI tools, the types of academic tasks they are assigned, faculty support, and institutional policies influence their perceptions and attitudes toward the use of generative AI for academic purposes. The study utilized a descriptive-correlational design, guided by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which provides insights into how users accept and effectively utilize technology. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed as a robust statistical technique to analyze the impact of various factors on college students' perceptions and attitudes regarding the use of generative AI for academic work. The study's constructs were assessed for reliability and validity using Cronbach's Alpha, Average Variance Extracted (AVE), and the Heterotrait-Monotrait (HTMT) ratio. The findings indicate that the complexity and intensity of academic tasks, students' engagement with generative AI platforms, and the support they receive from educational stakeholders significantly influence their attitudes toward using these platforms for academic assignments. Conversely, students' perceptions of generative AI are heavily shaped by the support systems available to them and their understanding of the potential risks associated with using such technologies for their assignments and projects. This research contributes to the ongoing discussion about the ethical and practical implications of AI in education, providing valuable insights into best practices for integrating AI technologies to enhance learning while upholding academic integrity.},

Yet, while the popular imagination has been captured, evidence indicates that pre-college students, especially those from underrepresented populations, lack adequate education about careers in the field. Effective methods for gaining understanding include shadowing professionals or acquiring internships, yet these means are often not attainable or realistic for many students. Overall, this insufficient education can lead to future disadvantages, including future workforce disparities. To address these problems, Computer Science Next (CSNext) is an organization that was founded in early 2024 to convey insights from the current to the next generation of computer scientists. CSNext's first project will be a series of video interviews with leaders in artificial intelligence intended for a high school student audience. Video interviews will be released for free, and responses will be synthesized to share meaningful and insightful commonalities and responses. In addition, a list of the resources discussed in the interview will be cataloged alongside the videos and indexed for the site in its entirety. Particular attention will be focused on inclusivity, including underrepresented minorities, when selecting interview candidates.",

By studying the development of GAN (Generative Adversary Networks), this paper proposes an AI art image synthesis algorithm based on GAN. An hourglass-shaped CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) with layer hopping connection is designed, which consists of coding and decoding. By adding corresponding interval convolution layers, the underlying texture information of the image is preserved, and the identity loss is maintained, so that the original image and the generated image are consistent in color. The results show that all three CNN models have high recognition accuracy for data sets, and the recognition accuracy for both data sets is higher than 99\%.

It proposes an investigatory research paper that tries to unmask the intersections between AI technologies and literary creativity, delving into how, in fact, such digital novelties are turning the scenery of English literature upside down. This paper will, at first, make an attempt to give some sort of comprehensive overview of the current state of AI technologies. Among the AI tools and algorithms, it is the special attention of somehow making their applications within the realm of literary creation, analysis, and interpretation. The core of these studies plunges into the details of what AI has to do with generating literary content, be it through algorithms writing poems, short stories, and even novels in the style of famous authors or totally from scratch. This study expands the scope of consideration to the collaborative processes between human authors and AI, focusing on synergetic potential for creative exploration and emergence of hybrid authorial identities. In addition, implications of the use of AI in literary analysis were described due to the fact that it is being applied to reveal new critical insights into classic texts using machine-learning models, predicting the future direction of literature, and even critiquing—again using a similar style generator—works of literature with a degree of insight thought previously exclusive to human scholars. Another important focus area will be the pedagogical implications for integrating AI into English literature education.",

GAI models like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Bard have recently caught the attention of industry and academia equally. GAI applications span various industries like art, gaming, fashion, and healthcare. In healthcare, GAI shows promise in medical research, diagnosis, treatment, and patient care and is already making strides in real-world deployments. There has yet to be any detailed study concerning the applications and scope of GAI in healthcare. Addressing this research gap, we explore several applications, real-world scenarios, and limitations of GAI in healthcare. We examine how GAI models like ChatGPT and DALL-E can be leveraged to aid in the applications of medical imaging, drug discovery, personalized patient treatment, medical simulation and training, clinical trial optimization, mental health support, healthcare operations and research, medical chatbots, human movement simulation, and a few more applications. Along with applications, we cover four real-world healthcare scenarios that employ GAI: visual snow syndrome diagnosis, molecular drug optimization, medical education, and dentistry. We also provide an elaborate discussion on seven healthcare-customized LLMs like Med-PaLM, BioGPT, DeepHealth, etc.,Since GAI is still evolving, it poses challenges like the lack of professional expertise in decision making, risk of patient data privacy, issues in integrating with existing healthcare systems, and the problem of data bias which are elaborated on in this work along with several other challenges. We also put forward multiple directions for future research in GAI for healthcare.",

This essay looks at how AI can improve medical images. It focuses on deep learning algorithms, computer vision, and machine learning models that can make complicated diagnosis tasks easier to do automatically. These technologies make it possible to find and study small trends in medical pictures that a person might miss. This helps doctors make faster and more accurate diagnoses, especially in cancer, heart, and neurology. AI can find problems in X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and its performance is on par with or even better than that of expert doctors. The paper also looks at how AI can be used to predict diseases by looking at old image data along with clinical factors. Researchers are looking at techniques like reinforcement learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to see if they can improve picture quality and help make fake data for rare diseases. This will help make diagnosis tools that are more accurate. The study also shows how AI is becoming more and more important for solving problems like inconsistent data, picture noise, and wrong interpretations. As healthcare continues to go digital, adding AI to medical imaging systems could help with personalized treatment plans, lower the number of mistakes made during diagnosis, and speed up work processes.",

To address this, we introduce in this article generative AI (GenAI) on the Edge, a comprehensive benchmarking dataset designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs deployed on edge devices. Leveraging a distributed testbed of Raspberry Pi 5 devices orchestrated with lightweight Kubernetes (K3s), the dataset captures a broad range of performance metrics essential for assessing the feasibility of local inference in constrained environments. These metrics include detailed measurements of throughput, inference latency, memory utilization, and computational efficiency, along with granular timing data for key stages of the inference pipeline—sample, prefill, and decode phases. We systematically evaluate LLMs of varying sizes under real-world deployment scenarios, with a particular emphasis on CPU-based edge platforms. By conducting multiple runs of conversation-based evaluations, GenAI on the Edge provides actionable insights into the tradeoffs between performance and resource efficiency, enabling better decision-making for LLM deployment in edge environments.

The main objective is to clarify the types of activities and corresponding risks. Our starting point is to identify the vulnerabilities of AI models and outline how malicious actors can abuse them. Subsequently, we explore AI-enabled and AI-enhanced attacks. While we present a comprehensive overview, we do not aim for a conclusive and exhaustive classification. Rather, we provide an overview of the risks of enhanced AI application, that contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the issue. Specifically, we suggest four types of malicious abuse of AI (integrity attacks, unintended AI outcomes, algorithmic trading, membership inference attacks) and four types of malicious use of AI (social engineering, misinformation/fake news, hacking, autonomous weapon systems). Mapping these threats enables advanced reflection of governance strategies, policies, and activities that can be developed or improved to minimize risks and avoid harmful consequences.

The results of the study show that the use of AI in promotional materials significantly improves the efficiency and branding of MSMEs, enabling the production of high-quality content at a lower cost. However, challenges remain, related to the limited scope of the study which only focuses on one sector, namely Muslim fashion MSMEs and the lack of AI's ability to understand the nuances of brand identity in depth. This study contributes to increasing the understanding of the synergy between design thinking and generative AI, as it can provide practical guidance for MSMEs in optimizing digital marketing, and suggests future research that focuses more on assisting MSMEs directly in implementing AI in their businesses.",

This is especially true when it comes to image generation, where GANs have displayed impressive capabilities. Over time, as researchers have grappled with the challenges posed by the original GAN model, a plethora of GAN variants have been introduced. These are tailored to counteract training instability, mode collapse, and various other challenges intrinsic to the base GAN model. Despite the extensive variety of GAN techniques available, there is still a knowledge gap when it comes to understanding their relative performances on specific datasets. For many practitioners, choosing the right GAN model for a given dataset remains a trial-and-error endeavor. In an attempt to shed light on this matter, our research undertakes a deep dive into three of the most notable GAN techniques: the classic GAN, the one built upon Wasserstein Distance, often abbreviated as W-GAN, and its subsequent evolution, WGAN-GP.",

There are also still some hurdles on a technical and legal level as well as trust on the human side. Ultimately, the application of such techniques is particularly important in this area, but this is often not possible without the well-functioning and widespread use of Artificial Intelligence in manufacturing industry. However, it is a further step towards intelligent manufacturing and the acceptance of Artificial Intelligence in this area. The publication not only shows the latest developments, but also some use cases of Explainable Artificial Intelligence in manufacturing. Not only legal aspects but also ethical aspects are highlighted. In conclusion, it can be stated that Explainable Artificial Intelligence methods per se are well established, but their implementation and use in practice is lagging behind. A major point here in the future will be the explanation of generative artificial intelligence and user-centred explanations for non-domain experts. A standardised definition of explainability and standards for evaluating the individual methodologies must also be created.",

    abstract = "As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly popular, so too does the frequency it is attacked. One area where artificial intelligence models are being embraced heavily is avionics, where it is used in a variety of areas including intrusion detection, surveillance, radar, navigation, and more. These networks are vulnerable to a number of attacks, one of which being the adversarial attack. Adversarial attacks aim to perturb the input to the image classification model, which can lead to output misclassifications, lowering the overall model accuracy. This paper will demonstrate how such an attack can lower the accuracy of a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on an aircraft image dataset. The perturbed inputs will be generated by a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on the same dataset as the CNN. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator. The generator will continually create new images based off of the dataset, while the discriminator decides whether or not the image is generated or from the reference dataset. This forms a feedback loop, where the generator continues to improve based on the output of the discriminator. Once trained, the outputs of the GAN will be used to misclassify the trained CNN in an attempt to lower the model’s accuracy. Following this, adversarial defenses such as feature squeezing and random smoothing will be discussed. These defenses attempt to mitigate the damage done by an attack, usually by adapting the model, modifying the input, or modifying the data the model is trained on. This can cause the accuracy of the model to slightly fall from its original accuracy, but with the benefit of being more resilient to adversarial attacks. We analyze this tradeoff and highlight the advantages of adversarial training in learning-enabled avionics systems.",

AI has found widespread application in automated systems, financing, and healthcare. With the increasing use of AI, models and algorithms have started surpassing the significant ideals of human performance. The significance of generative AI (GenAI) lies in its concentration on the realms of knowledge work and creative labor, which encompasses a significant number of humans, totalling billions. Procreative AI or GenAI has the potential of enhancing the efficiency and creativity of people by at least 10\%. It can also improve their speed, efficiency, and overall capabilities to some extent. GenAI possesses the capability of generating immense economic value up to trillions of dollars. AI systems used to be rule-based and had limited capabilities. The emergence of algorithms for deep learning toward the century’s end paved the way for more sophisticated GenAI models. GenAI is a specialized branch of AI that specifically concentrates on the production of novel content, including audio, video, and writings, through the utilization of artificially intelligent deep learning algorithms. Implementing AI for decision- making in sustainable project life cycle operations remains difficult. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has empowered developers to engage with generative algorithms, effectively transforming natural language queries into code for diverse programming languages. Highly advanced technologies such as Codacy and OpenAI Codex are widely utilized to assist LLMs and their adoption is steadily growing. GenAI solutions leverage aspects such as “completion” to significantly improve the creation of software. AI is extensively used in a number of manufacturing organizations, including those in healthcare, finance, robotics, and automation. However, using AI to make decisions in sustainable project life cycle management is still a difficult undertaking. The present research explores the utilization of AI techniques for decision-making to promote sustainable operations throughout the various phases of a project life cycle. This chapter compares the existing GenAI project life cycles and also suggests the practical framework, as also provides the various futuristic recommendations for sustainable project life cycles.",

It examines how different stakeholder groups—AI experts, energy domain experts, and non-experts—develop trust, distrust, or overtrust in AI-generated outputs and highlights the risks associated with these trust states. While overtrust can lead to blind reliance on incorrect AI outputs, distrust can result in the unnecessary rejection of accurate AI recommendations, ultimately reducing the effectiveness of AI-assisted decision-making. Using the VIRTSI (Variability and Impact of Reciprocal Trust States towards Intelligent Systems) methodology, this research monitors human-AI trust evolution through Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and quantifies trust behaviors using user-adapted Confusion Matrices, addressing a critical gap in AI trust dynamics that traditional acceptance models overlook. The findings validate VIRTSI’s ability to track trust transitions. The study reveals that AI experts exhibit skepticism due to their awareness of AI’s limitations, energy experts tend to overtrust AI, likely influenced by its confident and seemingly reliable responses, and non-experts display inconsistent trust, highlighting decision-making challenges. These findings confirm VIRTSI’s premise that trust in AI is dynamic, varies by user expertise, and must be continuously monitored and assessed. Ultimately, this study strengthens VIRTSI as a necessary framework for assessing and optimizing trust in AI-driven sustainability solutions, ensuring that AI systems are not only trusted but also used effectively and responsibly in energy applications. Unlike other models of technology acceptance that focus solely on adoption, VIRTSI provides a continuous and quantifiable approach to trust calibration, identifying harmful trust patterns and guiding improvements in AI-human interaction over time.",

    abstract = "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is widely recognized as one of the most influential technologies for the future, having sparked a paradigm shift in scientific research. The field of education has also been greatly impacted by this transformative technology, with researchers exploring the applications of generative AI, particularly ChatGPT, in education. However, existing research primarily focuses on generating text from text, and there remains a relative scarcity of studies on leveraging multimodal generation capabilities to address key challenges in multimodal data supported instruction. In this article, we present a technical framework for generating Tang poetry situational videos, emphasizing the utilization of generative AI to address the need for multimedia teaching resources. Our framework comprises three main modules: textual situational comprehension, image creation, and video generation. Moreover, we have developed a situational video generation system that incorporates various technologies, including text-to-text generation models, text-to-image generation models, image interpolation, text-to-speech synthesis, and video synthesis. To ascertain the efficacy of the modules within the Tang poetry situational video generation system, we undertook a comparative analysis utilizing the prevalent text-to-image and text-to-video generation models.

    abstract = "Significant progress has been achieved in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) in recent years. Nevertheless, a significant gap continues to exist in the effective surveillance of human actions, activities, and the recognition of human movements or poses. Machines and computers are fundamentally incapable of comprehending human activities without user intervention. Consequently, we now depend on technology to record and archive human actions through live broadcast data, videos, or images. The field of pose estimation, which is a critical area of research with applications in fields such as Augmented Reality, Animation, Gaming, Healthcare, and Sports, is expanding due to the rapid advancement of computer vision technology. This project implements innovative methods to train models and deter- mine poses, utilizing random inputs from internet images, videos, and live streaming. In particular, models that have been trained with artificial intelligence have been created for daily physical activities that necessitate intricate pose estimation. The initial step in the project is to utilize MediaPipe to estimate the poses of the human body. Subsequently, the angles between the body joints are calculated to create the desired models. Additionally, a web-based user interface (WEB-UI) was developed to enable access from any location. The methodology involves the extraction of data from critical body locations, the framing of models, and the utilization of the MediaPipe model due to its superior performance and features in comparison to other models. The objective of this method is to develop a web application for end-users, train AI models for daily physical activities, and establish an efficient system for single human pose estimation. This approach provides a cost-effective alternative to physical trainers and enables the monitoring of health and sports activities to be enhanced.",

Motivated by the high-accuracy decision-making capabilities of artificial intelligence, this article aims to highlight the effectiveness of artificial intelligence applications in the areas of virus detection, health monitoring, face mask detection, crowd sensing, and satellite-based environment monitoring. One of the most promising deep learning techniques presented in the literature is the convolutional neural network (CNN) that has shown remarkable classification accuracy. The reason for using artificial intelligence in this area is the inherent difficulty of these applications such as detecting COVID-19 infections using lung images due to its resemblance with other respiratory diseases. While the lack of sufficient training data is considered one of the main difficulties, it has been alleviated with the aid of specialized artificial intelligence techniques such as generative adversarial networks and transfer learning. Satellite-based imagery along with deep learning have shown an improvement in the air quality due to the imposed mobility restrictions during the pandemic. Apart from the technical challenges, some applications faced social and ethical challenges that are mainly related to the patient privacy. The latter factor have made dataset availability more limited, and restricted the implementation of some applications such as contact tracing. This work examines state-of-the-art studies and shows the effectiveness of artificial intelligence in solving the most challenging technical problems encountered during the pandemic.",

Gaming studies hire and pay high costs to artists to create images for the game which is also time consuming. With the pervasive integration of artificial intelligence across various sectors, the application of AI in game development presents a promising solution to these challenges. This study focuses on the comparison and outcomes of two advanced generative AI tools, DALL-E and Midjourney, to reduce the time and cost associated with the creation of dynamic 2D game assets. The comparison process for both the AI tools involves creation of a Unity based game that integrates DALL-E and Midjourney to generate dynamic game assets which were used in the gameplay to get the user feedback inside the game. The findings reveal that both DALL-E and Midjourney significantly reduce the time and financial barriers traditionally associated with game asset creation, democratizing game development and allowing smaller studios to produce competitive content. DALL-E was found to be highly effective in rapidly transforming textual descriptions into high-quality visual assets, making it superior in terms of speed and cost-efficiency compared to Midjourney. Player feedback indicated a higher level of satisfaction and engagement with DALL-E-generated assets, particularly due to its superior performance in handling prompts and generating contextually relevant images.",

    abstract = "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to reshape the creative landscape of filmmaking, particularly in the domain of screenwriting. Once relegated to speculative fiction, AI now emerges as a practical co-creator, offering tools capable of generating compelling narratives from minimal input. This study explores the evolving role of AI in screenwriting by evaluating story outputs generated by Bard AI against those written by human screenwriters. Using a structured, two-phase research design, the investigation compares the narratives based on five qualitative variables: plot, narration, character development, dialogue, and cultural relevance. A three-tiered input strategy—ranging from basic to extended prompts—was adopted to assess the AI's creative flexibility and responsiveness. Results show that while AI-generated stories demonstrate coherence, stylistic fluency, and efficient scene setting, they fall short in emotional depth, cultural nuance, and imaginative progression. Human-written scripts, though less structured, excel in dialogue and subtextual character portrayal. The findings highlight the potential of AI as a valuable tool in early-stage ideation and structural support, especially for Gen Z creators, while reaffirming the irreplaceable role of human imagination in storytelling. This research advocates for a hybrid screenwriting model, where AI serves as a creative assistant rather than a substitute for human authorship.",

The study explores AI's potential to improve KM processes, focusing on how it influences social interactions, facilitates knowledge community development, and fosters collaborative intelligence by leveraging the strengths of both AI and human capabilities. AI's transformative role in KM includes enhancing knowledge creation, storage, and dissemination, accelerating processes like externalization and combination in the SECI model. However, the paper notes AI's current limitations in managing tacit knowledge and human-centric decision-making. The research underscores AI's capacity to streamline KM processes, improve efficiency, and unlock new opportunities for organizations.

While AI has previously been employed for basic tasks related to SLRs, such as relevant paper screening and classification within scope, there is still limited research on information retrieval from the full texts of scientific papers. This study focuses on the next phase in the SLR, which involves scientific documentary analysis. The methodology presented in this work compares the AI tools in the market to facilitate scientific documentary analysis and enhance and refine research skills in engineering students. Also, this paper addresses the challenges to automatically run documentary analysis during a SLR. To do so, several techniques to extract information from AIs are presented, including Application Programming Interfaces (API) or Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). According to the results, most of the AI tools have a limitation in the operations students can perform per day. Only PDFgear offers a no-cost solution with unlimited usage, while some other AI tools allow limited usage for not so high prize. In conclusion, this paper presents a contribution during the documentary analysis of a SLR. It is important to keep in mind the constraints associated with the limited usage of AIs, the accuracy of AI tools, or the complexity of the developed scripts for automating the process. Due to the rapidly changing market for artificial intelligence, the validity of this study is limited to the current state of the tools. Similar studies will be necessary as AI tools continue to evolve.",

Diverse AI applications, already a component of military operations, stand to further revolutionize threat-intelligence analytics, curation, and presentation in years to come. In doing so, they portend heightened efficiency and higher tempos of security operations while minimizing risk potential. And yet, challenges abound. AI inputs to deliberative processes may be perceived as more or less robust, accurate, or generalizable according to a range of factors that influence decision-makers. Then these habits and preferences might be reintroduced to the information loop in several ways, as the algorithm, the design/implementation process, and institutions adapt to accommodate the human element. Malicious actors are even likely to target this action-reaction loop to influence AI systems. This two-phase cycle is perhaps most worrisome in relation to cyber conflict, where informational ambiguity, functionally diverse workforces, and an expansive and fragmented threat environment combine to produce an immense opportunity for baking bias into the loop. This paper presents the results of two experiments designed to explore different manifestations of AI systems in the cyber conflict decision-making loop. Though findings suggest that technical expertise positively impacts respondents’ ability to gauge the potential utility and credibility of an input (indicating that training can, in fact, overcome decision-maker bias), the perception of human agency in the loop even in the presence of AI inputs mitigates this cautionary effect and makes decision-makers more willing to operate on less overall information.",

The study was carried out within the frame of teaching natural science discipline “Chemistry” and socio-cultural ones (“Cultural Studies” and “Sociology”). It involved all types of educational activities and resources for all kinds of classes in these disciplines. It was found that effectiveness of applying artificial intelligence to support these students in mastering disciplines is determined mainly by specifics of a their educational and rehabilitation background. Research has confirmed that generative artificial intelligence can be a good assistant to students only provided that they have developed verbal and so called “21st century skills”: critical and analytical thinking, mastering complex content and working in digital environments.",

Such systems promise to find out whether a given text was written by a human or created by an artificial intelligence (AI). The ability to identify the “synthetic” nature of a text is paramount in many workplaces as well as in the educational field, where we focused our research. More specifically, we considered the academic environment and the frequent request by faculty to students to write term papers on a wide variety of topics. Then, it is essential for teachers to be able to evaluate content quality as well as their authenticity. Until now, anti-plagiarism tools have been widely used to verify that homework assignments were not copied, but the recent advent of generative artificial intelligence-based tools changed the game, moving the focus to automatic generation. In both cases, we are facing a violation of the educational pact by a student, versus a teacher, if not outright an offence. Conversely, an unfounded accusation of fraud by a teacher toward a student would be equally serious. Therefore, to use automatic detection tools one must have a guarantee on the reliability of their output.",

However, when it comes to culture and creativity, many social and political cost factors should be taken into account. It is crucial to identify the opportunities that AI can offer in terms of the preservation, use, promotion, and accessibility of Cultural Heritage (CH). However, ethical concerns should be outlined when applying AI in cultural settings, such as for the digital replica of official UNESCO heritage sites or an unbiased explanation and interpretation of a work of art. This paper provides a first attempt to define the main ethical findings on this topic and propose it as an ethical framework to assess different risks arising from the use of AI in the CH domain. The application of this disruptive technology in the arts is evaluated through the lens of ethical principles for trustworthy AI and it explores whether the wider accessibility and improved preservation techniques enabled by AI come at some cost in terms of interpretation, social and cultural inclusion, subjectivism, or other forms of bias. The main ethical principles that emerge from the literature for the application of AI in the cultural domain are the following: Shared Responsibility, Meaningful Participation, Explainability, Accessibility, Sustainability, Reliability and Dignity. The findings underline the importance of establishing specific sectoral ethical guidelines for AI in the field of tangible and intangible CH to support and enhance its sustainable development without compromising its values, significance, sense of belonging and strong social impact.",

Conventional plagiarism detection methods became obsolete as generative AI produced individual responses for each student. The development of generative AI technology offers a path to offloading much of the workload that happens behind the scenes of instructional time. AI can help outline curriculum, draft lesson plans, generate assessments, and draft communication and feedback for teachers. One of the fears echoing from most industries is about the future of the workforce in the age of AI. This chapter offers a framework for thinking about how to integrate AI into the educational systems. As AI technologies continue to advance and become more prevalent, educators will need to be prepared to show examples of successful AI integration in education and preemptively answer questions and concerns from stakeholders.</p>",

The Hybrid Adaptive AI Security Framework (HAASF), a novel framework that combines reinforcement learning (RL), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and swarm intelligence (SI) to provide strong, adaptive security for IoT ecosystems, is what this paper offers. HAASF employs a DQN-based RL defender to acquire dynamic defense prioritization, GANs for strong proactive learning through realistic attack model generation, and PSO-induced SI for IoT node distributed threat mitigation. Evaluated on an NS-3 simulated testbed smart home with 50 devices of diverse hardware, HAASF was compared with five types of attacks, i.e., DDoS, Man-in-the-Middle, Sybil, Data Tampering, and Replay attacks. Against baselines—single RL, signature-based IDS, and CNN-based anomaly detection—HAASF achieved a 95\% detection rate, 4\% false positive rate, 1.9-second response time, and 40 mW energy consumption. These are HAASF's capabilities in new threat detection, predicting attack patterns, and resource optimization combined against traditional IoT defenses. Through the combination of hybrid AI approaches, HAASF offers scalable, energy-efficient, and responsive security upon which scalable IoT systems can be based in increasingly interconnected and vulnerable systems.",

Each answer was assessed by human stakeholders who were non-expert in the energy Urban Domain (e.g house owners, building managers, etc.), who either accepted or rejected the responses based on validation processes. The analysis highlighted key aspects such as repetition, specification, and objections in the interaction with ChatGPT, offering insights into the effectiveness of AI in supporting energy-related decisions. The findings reveal that while AI can provide valuable information, user validation and expert consultation are critical for practical implementation. This highlights both the potential and limitations of integrating AI tools like ChatGPT in enhancing non-expert stakeholder engagement and decision-making in urban energy management, emphasizing the ongoing need for human expert involvement.",

However, integrating digital culture with modernity while classifying AI image generation technology was a major concern. In this research, the hyper parameter tuned Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Stochastic Gradient (DCNN-SGD) is proposed to overcome these drawbacks, by classifying $A I$ images of product design. The open source AI images are collected and pre-processed to achieve noise free images by applying Gaussian filter. The pre-processed images are then fed to the CNN to extract features. The creative product design process is analysed which includes research and analysis, design expression and the final evaluation. The DCNN with convolutional, pooling and fully connected layers are used for the classification and identification of cultural symbols. For the effective identification of cultural heritage, the hyperparameters of the DCNN are finetuned with SGD. The experimental results showed that the proposed DCNN-SGD achieved better performance with classification accuracy of $\mathbf{9 8. 6 7 \\%}$, precision of $\mathbf{9 5. 7 7 \\%}$, and recall of $94.26 \\%$ when compared to the existing methods improved Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).",

The model is implemented in Python, utilizing popular libraries such as TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and NLTK. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model on a Myers-Briggs Personality Type Dataset obtained from Kaggle, containing self-reported MBTI types and associated textual data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the GAILP model, achieving an accuracy of over 97\% in personality recognition tasks. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating visual and textual cues for accurate personality recognition and underscore the potential of GAILP-based approaches in this domain.",

An analytical literature review was conducted within the Johns Hopkins University Sheridan Libraries Catalyst databases to support stated objectives around selected NIST common language terms related to safety and security. The resulting analysis demonstrates that, in the U.S. and on an international scale, selected AIMD literature and guidance may not include or consistently use critical, integrated terms for AIMD security or safety, such as NISTIR 8312's four principles of artificial intelligence explainability. In conclusion, AIMD safety and security could be addressed with NIST common languages.",

This paper proposes GenAI-SC, a generative semantic communication architecture that utilizes large-scale pre-training models for semantic information extraction and adopts a diffusion model as its core. The architecture extracts and compresses semantic information through large-scale models and utilizes diffusion models to achieve high-quality image recovery, which is especially suitable for complex communication environments. To verify the effectiveness of this architecture, this paper design two task modes, plain text diffusion image generation and text-image joint diffusion generation, to flexibly cope with different transmission tasks. The experimental results show that GenAI-SC performs well under different channel conditions and inference steps, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio environment, showing that GenAI-SC has good multitasking capability and communication robustness.

Unlike models that aim to establish a mapping between inputs and outputs by extracting features, the goal of generative models is to learn the distribution of training data and generate new samples with similar features from a latent space. In the development of generative models, efforts have been made to improve the diversity of generated samples, progressing from VAE (variational auto-encoders). VAE achieves random sampling and generation of diverse images by transforming the bottleneck layer of the encoder from predicting low-dimensional feature maps to predicting positions sampled from a normal distribution. Subsequently, vector quantized variational autoencoders(VQ-VAE) and VQ-VAE-2 models were introduced, followed by the first-generation DALL-E model, and then diffusion models. We will discuss the basic principles of each model, the strengths and weaknesses of the models, and the innovations introduced by each model compared to its predecessors. After that, an overview of the evaluation metrics specific to generation models is provided. Finally, the applications that generation model enables are summarized.

This research aims to explore the potential of AI-driven solutions in the literature screening process and compare them with traditional labor- and time-intensive approaches.

The analysis focuses on the accuracy, efficiency, and usefulness of AI in processing large volumes of literature. Results suggested that AI-driven approaches can reduce substantial manual work and time investment while maintaining certain levels of accuracy in identifying relevant studies. However, the challenge of algorithmic bias remains, and this calls for human intervention.

Realizing the classification and recognition of infrared images by ANN is helpful to the intelligent development of night vision technology, as well as improve the accurate judgment of the surrounding environment by unmanned vehicles at night, and better ensure the safety of people and vehicles. However, the existing infrared image data set contains a small number of images, and the types of scenes and targets presented in the images are single, which cannot support the training of ANN. ANN cannot obtain the classification function of infrared images through full learning. In this paper, an infrared image generative model based on generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed, which can convert the existing visible light data set into the infrared version of the data set in a short time, and then solve the problem of lack of infrared image data sets. To train ResNet by infrared version data set can realize its classification function for infrared images. The model with the existing image generative model is compared through several evaluation indexes. The results show that the model is more effective in generative infrared images. Inputting ImageNet data set into this model can generate ImageNet infrared version data set.

Compared to various code completion tools on the market, CodeBlizz takes a complete strategy to dramatically lower the learning curve for inexperienced workers while simultaneously increasing coding productivity. This is achieved through the direct integration of learning resources into the working environment. CodeBlizz utilizes proficient transformer-based models, such as CodeBERT for comprehending syntax and producing useful snippets and GPT-3 to generate context-aware code referrals. Also, the plugin employs T5 models to provide real-time problem detection and debugging support by turning malfunctioning code into error messages and possible fixes. Added to that, adaptive learning from user feedback is feasible with reinforcement learning models such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN), which boosts the accuracy of the model over time. Together, these machine learning elements allow CodeBlizz to provide developers with solid and dynamic support from within the IDE, which helps to boost accuracy and speed up code completion. Without pushing users to leave the IDE, the plugin renders functionalities encompassing dynamically generated code snippets, syntax correction, error pattern identification, and real-time tutorials for learning at ease. On the survey, users reported a thirty percent reduction in time spent on error correction and tutorial seeks from online websites, which further validates the benefit of incorporating AI that generates code for immediate guidance within the coding routine.

With the advancement of digital technology, enhancing learners’ high awareness ability in digital literacy has become a key step in literacy development. On this basis, this study employed the response surface methodology (RSM) to evaluate various test indicators, including the number of words, number of answer points, and number of follow-up rounds, and evaluation indicators, including accuracy, expansion, and awareness, for generative artificial intelligence (GAI). A four-step process was followed that includes basic analysis of experiment results, factor estimation and variance analysis, multifactor response surface analysis, and indicator analysis. The findings indicate that the test factors related to the GAI-generated content had a significant impact on participants’ high awareness levels. These factors exhibited interactive effects, and the response surface model revealed an optimal approach for applying GAI to enhance awareness. Building on these insights, practical suggestions are proposed for using GAI to enhance digital literacy. On the basis of the research conclusions, practical approaches to applying GAI to enhance high awareness ability in digital literacy are proposed. These approaches include employing the critical point perturbation mechanism, role-oriented mechanism, and high awareness thinking chain mechanism. This study employed GAI to investigate learners’ high awareness ability in digital literacy, providing a case for the proper and innovative use of GAI in the context of education. Additionally, it provides information on the educational effectiveness of GAI and offers valuable references for similar studies on GAI applications.",

At this point, it has strong relations with biomedical and today\&\#x2019;s intelligent systems compete with human capabilities in medical tasks. However, advanced use of artificial intelligence causes intelligent systems to be black-box. That situation is not good for building trustworthy intelligent systems in medical applications. For a remarkable amount of time, researchers have tried to solve the black-box issue by using modular additions, which have led to the rise of the term: interpretable artificial intelligence. As the literature matured (as a result of, in particular, deep learning), that term transformed into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI).

While existing algorithms excel in this task, creating and formatting virtual environments is a costly and time-consuming process. Thus, there is an opportunity for automating this labor intensive process by leveraging recent development in computer vision. Recent development in deep generative models, especially GANs, has spurred much interest in the computer vision domain for synthesizing realistic images. GANs combine backpropagation with a competitive process involving a pair networks, called Generative Network G and Discriminative Network D, in which G generate artificial images and D classifies it into real or artificial image categories. As the training proceeds, G learns to generate realistic images to confuse D [1]. In this work, a convolutional architecture based on GAN, specifically Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) has been implemented to train a generative model that can produce good quality images of human faces at scale. CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) has been used to train the DCGAN model. Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), that measures the structural and contextual similarity of two images, has been used for quantitative evaluation of the trained DCGAN model. Obtained results shows that the quality of generated images is quite similar to the high quality images of the CelebA dataset.",

Using current deep-learning techniques, developing these systems requires large amounts of labelled training data. Obtaining this data is challenging due to costs, required expertise, inconsistency of imaging procedures and formatting, and patient privacy concerns. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) may alleviate some of these issues by supplying realistic artificial medical images. In this study, we trained progressively growing (PG)GAN to synthesize full-sized computed tomography (CT) images and succeeded. Performance of the PGGAN was evaluated using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), Inception Score (IS), and Precision (P) and Recall (R). These metrics were calculated for generated, training, and validation images. The influence of dataset size was explored by varying the number of samples used to calculate each metric; this affected FID, P, and R, but not IS, which has obvious implications for comparing studies. The FID between artificial CT images from PGGAN and real validation images was 42; interestingly, FID between real training and validation images was 24. This suggests that a further reduction of 18 could be achieved by improving the generative model. Overall, artificial CT images generated by PGGAN were almost indistinguishable from real images to the human eye, although computational metrics could identify differences between them. In future work, GANs may be deployed to augment data for training medical AI systems.",

Furthermore, the increased use of automation, edge computing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), fueled by generative AI technology, has increasingly elevated the risks of AI. Most of the existing research only covers ethical components and lacks the breadth of Responsible AI (RAI), while some have presented components such as justice and solidarity but do not provide an approach or mechanism to implement those in an AI-based system. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a comprehensive RAI framework for AVs with four key contributions. First, it provides an in-depth analysis of AI risks in AVs, encompassing safety, security, ethical, and legal domains, offering a structured classification to guide developers and regulators. Second, it introduces a holistic RAI framework that spans the AI lifecycle, identifying and mitigating risks at each AV system development and deployment stage. Third, the paper focuses on bias and fairness within AV systems, outlining precise techniques for bias detection and mitigation across data collection, algorithm design, and real-time decision-making. Lastly, the research presents bias removal simulations using publicly available AV datasets, evaluating mitigation strategies such as synthetic data generation and algorithmic fairness analysis. The proposed framework and simulations provide a practical foundation for integrating RAI principles into AV development, ensuring safer, fairer, and more accountable AI-driven mobility solutions.",

Additionally, fluorescent probes currently approved for clinical use remain limited within the wavelength of NIR-IIa (1000–1300 nm). NIR-IIb (1500–1700 nm) imaging has the potential to deliver higher resolution than NIR-IIa, but relies on toxic fluorescent probes not approved for human use. To support clinical high-precision imaging, we propose a NIR-II fluorescence enhanced imaging method based on perception-enhanced spectrum shift generative adversarial network with explainable AI systems (xAI-PSSGAN). The proposed method tackles the problem of limited unpaired data training, and generates NIR-IIb resembling images with enhanced resolution and reduced noise. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed method effectively improves the imaging quality and surpasses competing alternatives, which is of great significance to promote the high-quality NIR-II imaging in clinical practice.",

We examine the contextualised trust of individuals in AI, the support for using AI, and AI adoption intentions in a survey experiment ($\mathrm{N}=306$) across three contexts (reasons): technical, mental health, and creative assistance. Participants read ostensible news articles about AI use in one of these three contexts, and completed a survey on their resultant and previous attitudes. The results show that trust and adoption were significantly higher for technical assistance, and lower for creative assistance and mental health assistance. However, support for using AI for mental health assistance was significantly higher than creative assistance, and comparable to technical assistance. Contextualised trust and support also significantly predicted AI adoption intentions, above and beyond trust scores towards AI in general. Our study suggests that contextualised attitudes towards specific AI products appear to be sufficiently differentiated from (general) AI attitudes, and instances where AI is used for technical reasons, as opposed to creative or mental health reasons, garners more favourable attitudes.",

We present a comprehensive study of various DGM architectures, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Normalizing Flows, and their efficacy in generating high-fidelity medical images. Our experiments demonstrate that these models can produce synthetic data that retains the intricate features of real medical images while ensuring patient privacy. Furthermore, when used as augmentation in training diagnostic algorithms, the synthetic data generated by our proposed models showed a significant improvement in the generalization capabilities of these algorithms.

We investigate the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in generating high-quality tissue images for both colon and prostate. The datasets we use are from the TCGA repository and contain various cancerous diseases for both colon and prostate. We outline how the data was pre-processed, and quality controlled and we also delineate the relevant experiments applied. We apply some of the most recent GAN architectures in ProGAN and StyleGAN to generate synthetic colon tissue images, achieving a literature-high Fréchet Inception Score (FID) score of 6.019 for colon tissue images and an FID score of 3.03 for prostate tissue images. Notably, the synthetic images produced were deemed indistinguishable from real samples when assessed by a practicing consultant histopathologist. By addressing the challenge of limited training data, our approach could ultimately contribute to earlier detection and improved treatment outcomes for cancer patients worldwide.",

Its size of growth and adaptability can fill in any kind of knowledge gap, specifically in distressful regions for applications related to skill development, translation of languages, medical learning, and virtual teaching. Interoperability with VR and the metaverse modernizes education further. The issues in this are data collection, biases in algorithms, and the human interaction is reduced. That would require explainable algorithms and robust data protection. Policymakers, educators, and technologists must be in a joint effort to see that GAI is used justly.

This paper looks into how the modern AI art generators work and identifies the various issues with AI art on technical, moral and legal grounds. Furthermore it aims to understands how the increased accessibility to AI art generators affects humans.Modern AI art generators use artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms and deep neural network algorithms to study a large amount of pre-existing artworks in portfolio and produce new art based on the prompts provided by the user. They use software such as CNN, GAN, NST.The biggest argument against AI art is that it needs the human creativity and imagination. But it has been argued that the human creativity is included in the text prompts provided by the artist. AI art generators have also been accused of stealing art works without permission of the artists which has been leading to some copyright issues. Furthermore AI art generators have been stealing artists’ commissions and work. AI art generators are not perfect yet and have several errors such as errors in the art generated such as anatomy errors(example: hands with six fingers instead of five etc). Artists have protested against the use of AI art generators. One such protest is the "No to AI generated images" movement wherein they flooded the portfolio in an AI art generator called "ArtStation" with images tagged as "trending in ArtStation in order to render all the generated images useless.},

Hence, mental disorders have become a serious public health challenge in nowadays society. Timely treatment of mental disorders plays a critical role for reducing the harm of mental illness to individuals and society. Music therapy is a type of non-pharmaceutical method in treating such mental disorders. However, conventional music therapy suffers from a number of issues resulting in a lack of popularity. Thanks to the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially the AI Generated Content (AIGC), it provides a chance to address these issues. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no work investigating music therapy from AIGC and closed-loop perspective. In this paper, we summarise some universal music therapy methods and discuss their shortages. Then, we indicate some AIGC techniques, especially the music generation, for their application in music therapy. Moreover, we present a closed-loop music therapy system and introduce its implementation details. Finally, we discuss some challenges in AIGC-based music therapy with proposing further research direction, and we suggest the potential of this system to become a consumer-grade product for treating mental disorders.",

Currently, our approach to NPD has remained largely unchanged for decades, yielding stubbornly poor results: only 30\% of NP development projects become commercial successes. However, the AI revolution is set to alter this landscape significantly! Leading early adopter firms demonstrate that AI not only finds many applications in NPD but also offers substantial payoffs, such as 50\% reductions in development times. This article provides an outline of the diverse and powerful applications of AI in NPD, offering numerous examples from leading companies. Examples include GE's use of digital models and twins to quickly test product designs in turbine development; BASFs use of AI to identify new molecules for use in customer formulations; and AI to generate new-product ideas, identify new-product opportunities, and even create new-product concepts. Our exploratory journey begins at the idea stage and traverses the entire new-product process to the postlaunch period. While AI might still resemble science fiction to many, that future is no longer fiction—it is here now. AI has arrived in full force! With an adoption window of about 13 years, the time is now to embrace AI in NPD in your business. AI will become a major milestone in NPD, perhaps the most important, within the decade.",

First, we discuss various aspects of governance of such policies, procedures and risk and then address a key topic which is detecting fake news on social media. In order for the users to be safe using social media we have to ensure that the governance aspects also include fake news detection. Many of the fake news detection techniques utilize Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and more recently Generative AI (GenAI) techniques. Therefore, the AI systems that implement the various techniques have to be trustworthy. That means these systems have to be secure as well as ensure fairness, privacy and integrity. Therefore, the paper will also discuss AI Governance as an integral part of Social Media Governance. Finally, to support the various applications and frameworks, both data and the cloud are critical. Large amounts of data are stored and managed by the social media systems as well as used to train the AI models. Furthermore, we need massive amounts of computing power that can be provided by the cloud.

Synthetic data is generated based on real-world observations and used to train several contemporary ML and AI models. These models are subjected to comparison with models trained on real data. Both trained models are evaluated under identical conditions on real-world testing data. These well-known, high-quality datasets are explored in this study covering diabetes and heart disease. While models trained on synthetic data show a slight decrease in objective performance, they still demonstrate viably accurate outcomes.

Especially, generative adversarial network is adopted in the field of image processing, such as image style transfer, image restoration, image super-resolution and so on. Although generative adversarial networks show remarkable success in image generation, training process is usually unstable and trained models collapse where many of the generated images may contain the same color or texture pattern. In this paper, the network of generator and discriminator are modified, and the residual block is added to the generative adversarial network architecture to learn better image features. To reduce the loss of image feature during training and get more features to stabilize image generation, we use feature matching to minimize feature loss between the real and generated images for stable training. In the experiment, performance improvement can be obtained by adopting our proposed method, which is also better than some state-of-the-art methods.",

    abstract = {Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is a task in artificial intelligence where an intelligent agent is required to answer questions about its environment. For example, to answer a question such as "Is the TV on or off?", the agent must navigate to the room with the TV and answer with either "On." or "Off." after recognizing the status. Unlike traditional question-answering systems that rely solely on text or static images, EQA involves agents that can move through a physical or simulated space, interact with the environment, and gather information to respond accurately. The agent must interpret both visual and linguistic inputs, navigate the environment, and complete tasks or locate objects based on the user’s questions. However, in the real world, the agent always faces unseen environments (i.e. different people’s houses), which makes the pre-trained model fail. Meanwhile, re-training in an unseen environment can cause high costs. Therefore, it is significant for the agent to learn continually by itself to cope with the challenges of unseen environments. In this work, we proposed a continual learning method based on generative adversarial imitation learning and self-supervision to support the agent when facing unseen environments. Besides, we designed a policy generator and policy quality discriminator to generate action policy sequences and evaluate the quality of the policy, respectively. Extensive experiments on the MP3D-EQA dataset demonstrate that our method reaches state-of-the-art performance.},

It outlines how these advanced technologies have been integrated into an existing feedback-oriented platform to guide instructors in providing feedback inputs and establish a reference framework for future innovations in practical skills training for health professions education. Specifically, the proposed solution uses LLMs to automatically evaluate feedback inputs made by instructors based on predefined and literature-based quality criteria and generates actionable textual explanations for reformulation. In addition, if the instructor requires, the tool supports summary generation for large sets of text inputs to achieve better student reception and understanding. The case study describes how these features were integrated into the feedback-oriented platform, how their effectiveness was evaluated in a controlled setting with documented feedback inputs, and the results of its implementation with real users through cognitive walkthroughs. Initial results indicate that this innovative implementation holds great potential to enhance learning and performance in physiotherapy education and has the potential to expand to other health disciplines where the development of procedural skills is critical, offering a valuable tool to assess and improve feedback based on quality standards for effective feedback processes. The cognitive walkthroughs allowed us to determine participants' usability decisions in the face of these new features and to evaluate the perceived usefulness, how this would integrate into their workload, and their opinion regarding the potential for the future within this teaching strategy.

However, managing T2D is challenging because blood glucose levels fluctuate due to diet, exercise, and patients’ idiosyncrasies. Approaches such as real-time monitoring, predictive modeling, and personalized treatment have been among the major breakthroughs in the field. Still, their holistic integration for dynamic dosing and dietary optimization has remained largely unexplored. This research analyzes insights from recent research that reveal different methodologies such as machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and predictive models in improving diabetes management outcomes. Some studies showed up to 1.5\% HbA1c reduction and time-in-range improvement by 20\% to 25\% due to artificial intelligence (AI) driven interventions. The accuracy of blood glucose prediction in these studies ranged from 85\% to 95\%, thus showing that these models can control blood sugar levels at any given moment. The preliminary results show that dynamic dosing models combined with dietary recommendations may achieve a 0.8\% to 1.2\% decrease in HbA1c and a 10\% to 15\% improvement in overall glycemic control. This study investigates the applications of Digital Twin (DT) technology, Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Generative AI (Gen AI) in diabetic control systems.

This paper examines the potential of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, to improve medical algorithms. It discusses the basic principles of LLM and provides a detailed analysis of ChatGPT, highlighting its exceptional interactive capabilities. Additionally, the study evaluates the real-world applications of ChatGPT in the medical domain, comparing its performance with other leading LLMs through clinically relevant experiments and rigorous analysis. Although ChatGPT is still in its basic versions, this work emphasizes the need to explore and improve its capabilities for medical applications to improve interaction and reduce human costs in the future.",

While progress has been made to better understand the trustworthiness and security of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, little has been done to translate this knowledge to education and training. There is a critical need to foster a qualified cybersecurity workforce that understands the usefulness, limitations, and best practices of AI technologies in the cybersecurity domain. To address this import issue, in our proposed learning paradigm, we leverage multidisciplinary expertise in cybersecurity, AI, and statistics to systematically investigate two cohesive research and education goals. First, we develop an immersive learning environment that motivates the students to explore AI/machine learning (ML) development in the context of real-world cybersecurity scenarios by constructing learning models with tangible objects. Second, we design a proactive education paradigm with the use of hackathon activities based on game-based learning, lifelong learning, and social constructivism. The proposed paradigm will benefit a wide range of learners, especially underrepresented students. It will also help the general public understand the security implications of AI. In this paper, we describe our proposed learning paradigm and present our current progress of this ongoing research work. In the current stage, we focus on the first research and education goal and have been leveraging cost-effective Minecraft platform to develop an immersive learning environment where the learners are able to investigate the insights of the emerging AI/ML concepts by constructing related learning modules via interacting with tangible AI/ML building blocks.",

While there are many ways to do this, one of the least computationally intensive is to use a voting ensemble, where the vote of each classifier is weighted by a number representing its performance. Choosing the appropriate weights is an involved process, that ranges from using trial and error to using sophisticated machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we proposed a novel technique that uses generative adversarial networks to customize the weights used for each individual input to the ensemble. Specifically, we propose to use conditional generative adversarial networks to generate the weights, with the input image acting as the label to the network and the appropriate weight being the output. We test the proposed system on an image classification task and show that the proposed method produces better results than using fixed weights by 2.43 percent.",

To ensure image fidelity, skip connections are introduced between the encoder and decoder.

The quality gap between the predicted frame and the ground truth is used as the basis to determine whether it is abnormal.

    abstract = "This paper investigates the ethical-legal issues underlying the implementation of Large Language Models, in the aftermath of the European Union Parliament's approval of the Artificial Intelligence Regulation. In very recent years, there has been a rapid evolution and multiform implementation of the so-called Artificial Intelligence. Notably, one significant development in AI is the creation of systems capable of performing tasks based on a set of established rules. Artificial Intelligence has recently undergone a significant revolution that has led to a radical paradigm shift, represented by the so-called Foundation Models, which have two main characteristics: emergence and homogenisation. On the other hand, Language Modelling (LM) is one of the main approaches to advance the linguistic intelligence of machines and thus a Foundation Model trained on textual data. The most recent development of this approach can be found in the so-called Large Language Models (LLM). These take the form of artificial neural networks pre-trained on huge datasets which, instead of being dedicated to a specific task, can perform a wide range of different functions at a level that is all the more accurate the greater the resources made available to them. The concept of language models is not new but has evolved with the progress of artificial intelligence over the decades. In general, LLMs are mainly trained in industrial settings where many important details of training (e.g. data collection and cleaning) are not disclosed. Thus, it is difficult to align LLMs with human values or preferences. Despite their capabilities, LLMs are also likely to produce toxic, fictitious or harmful content. Therefore, effective and efficient control approaches are required to eliminate the potential risk arising from the use of LLMs. For the purposes of the study conducted, it is intended to describe the development and outcomes with the aim to show not only the evolution of the responses offered by various LLM, but also and above all the possible ethical and legal implications that can be deduced from these outputs. Several models have been used for the implementation of the experiments: two GPT-2 models, Perplexity, ChatGPT (version 3.5), Llama. The language used for the implementation of the experiments was English, as it is structurally more neutral. In particular, with reference to a topic with a strong ethical and legal impact such as suicide, different answers were offered by the various models used. In conclusion, the essay offers reflections on the results of the experiment with reference to the EU Regulation on Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence represents for the jurist, not only European, a decisive challenge not only with regard to the categories of thought and formulation of operational languages, but above all with regard to the centrality of the human being. On the basis of these considerations, focusing on generative AI and in particular on Large Language Models, it is clear that many of the issues relating to copyright and the protection of personal data still remain unsolved, excluding those already regulated by the legislation on the point.",

In contrast to conventional approaches that rely on offline environments or CI/CD (Continuous integration and continuous deployment) pipelines, this methodology facilitates continuous performance enhancement during active usage of web application. An experimental evaluation involving 20 functions within a Laravel application demonstrated a 70\% optimization success rate, a 62.6\% reduction in execution time and an 18.18\% decrease in code lines. This approach preserves semantic consistency and provides reports to developers for further implementation.

This study identifies three core issues within STEM education: how to update curricula that lag technological advancements, limited opportunities for practical, hands-on application of skills, and constrained academic timeframes that limit the depth of transformative learning experiences.To address these issues, this research explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and Agile methodologies to bridge the gap between academic theory and industry practice in the field of product development.

We show how applying Generative AI and Agile technologies can enhance curriculum relevance, expand real-world skill development opportunities, and optimize learning within semester-based time constraints. AI enables adaptive, personalized learning and automates routine tasks, while Agile’s iterative approach fosters engagement and adaptability in real-world problem-solving scenarios.

This research takes a behavioral approach to examine the association between individual personality traits and tolerance of generative AI hallucinations. Drawing on error management theory and the big five personality traits, we examine how individuals with different personality traits tolerate generative AI hallucinations.

To address these challenges, this paper proposed an adaptive gAI-based multi-agent framework that enables collaboration between human actors and multiple AI agents, i.e. ExplainAgent, AuditAgent, RobustAgent and AutoAgent tailored to mirror and provide specialised support for the various aspects of trustworthy AI. Each of the agents will be clearly defined and specialised through the customisation of multiple modules encompassing 1) Communication and Cooperation, 2) Ensure Trust and 3) Execute and Evaluate Decisions. The framework focuses on improving explainability, fairness, and robustness while fostering human-AI collaboration with the aim of advancing trustworthy AI methods, tools and best practices leveraging AI and related technologies.",

Cultural heritage preservation and education have increasingly turned to Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to enhance learning experiences and promote the understanding and appreciation of diverse artistic expressions. We have conducted an initial empirical study on how ChatGPT can assist learners in analysing and interpreting poetic and lyrics works, offering insights into the historical, cultural, and literary significance embedded within the verses. Our findings highlight ChatGPT's significant potential but also major weaknesses with respect to poetry and lyrics. ChatGPT was found particularly good in the field of interpreting poetic content. Additionally, ChatGPT showed a very good performance in analogy identification, demonstrating a broad knowledge base encompassing various form of poetry, from Ancient Greek works to ecclesiastic hymns and modern compositions. However, opportunities for enhancement are evident in translation and historical context provision. Finally, ChatGPT's weakest aspect was its factual accuracy, occasionally producing errors without indicating uncertainty in its responses. Consequently, while ChatGPT displays substantial promise, its application in e-learning settings is not mature due to observed inaccuracies. Furthermore, we introduced MUSILYAN, a specialised software tool designed for musicological and lyrical analysis, complementing ChatGPT's capabilities. While Chat-GPT excels in natural language understanding and generation, MUSILYAN offers structured semantic content management and thematic organisation of lyrics. The integration of ChatGPT and MUSILYAN holds promise for enhancing the exploration and understanding of poetry and lyrics.",

With the advantages of low latency and privacy-preserving, serving PFMs of mobile AI services in edge intelligence is a viable solution for caching and executing PFMs on edge servers with limited computing resources and GPU memory. However, PFMs typically consist of billions of parameters that are computation- and memory-intensive for edge servers during loading and execution. In this article, we investigate edge PFM serving problems for mobile AIGC services of the metaverse. First, we introduce the fundamentals of PFMs and discuss their characteristic fine-tuning and inference methods in edge intelligence. Then, we propose a novel framework of joint model caching and inference for managing models and allocating resources to satisfy users’ requests efficiently. Furthermore, considering the in-context learning ability of PFMs, we propose a new metric to evaluate the freshness and relevance between examples in demonstrations and executing tasks, namely the Age of Context (AoC). Finally, we propose a least-context (LC) algorithm for managing cached models at edge servers by balancing the tradeoff among latency, energy consumption, and accuracy.",

There are some areas where images are not enough but with the help of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) this problem is solved at some limit. Due to the success of classical generative adversarial networks, the quantum researcher created quantum version of GAN and also called as quantum generative adversarial network (QGANs) which works on quantum computers which use quantum mechanics techniques such as quantum entanglement, superposition, teleportation and many more. The successful implementation in real life of quantum computers are not easy because of limited quantum resources and access to quantum processors but instead of that there are different QGAN models for different purpose, such as drug discovery, finance, image generation and many more which shown good result as compare to their classical counterparts.

The data acquired from the FER stage informs GenAI systems—such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs)—to produce contextually relevant and emotionally resonant responses. The proposed system leverages a sophisticated camera setup to capture facial data with high accuracy under diverse lighting conditions, ensuring robust and reliable emotion inference. Virtual avatars complete the multimodal experience by generating corresponding nonverbal cues. Special attention is given to creating a dynamic feedback loop for continuous learning and adaptation, leading to increasingly effective human-computer dialogues. Ethical implications, such as user privacy, data security, and bias mitigation, are central to the design and deployment of this system, underscoring the commitment to ethical standards and user empowerment.

Their application in artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) marks a pivotal advancement in the evolution from the Internet of Things (IoT) to the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). Considering the inherent multiple-access nature of AIoT, training GDMs via federated learning and deploying them collaboratively is paramount. However, such approaches introduce considerable security risks and energy consumption challenges. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive architecture for GDMs, encompassing both training and sampling stages. This architecture, termed secure and sustainable diffusion (SS-Diff), aims to thwart trigger-based security threats, such as backdoor attacks and trojan attacks, while simultaneously reducing energy consumption in multiple-access AIoT. The SS-Diff architecture incorporates a dynamic quantization mechanism within the training phase, significantly reducing communication overhead and thereby improving both spectrum and energy efficiency. During the sampling stage, a detection-based defense strategy is employed to identify and negate trigger inputs associated with malicious attacks. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance of the SS-Diff architecture. The results demonstrate that the SS-Diff can effectively train GDMs and eliminate the impact of the attacks, compared with existing schemes.",

Here, programmable networks are role players in approaching the tactile Internet’s low latency (≈ 1ms) pillar.

From the security perspective, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is another role player that enables the line-rate inference on the core network without involving the control plane.

Understanding and improving these interactions has the potential to enhance productivity, trust, and efficiency in AI-driven workflows. In this paper, we propose a taxonomy of interaction types between developers and AI tools, identifying eleven distinct interaction types, such as auto-complete code suggestions, command-driven actions, and conversational assistance. Building on this taxonomy, we outline a research agenda focused on optimizing AI interactions, improving developer control, and addressing trust and usability challenges in AI-assisted development.

Patient information from electronic health records and clinical dietetics guidelines are incorporated into prompts for MeaIGM, which is refined through nutritionist validations and users' feedback. On the other hand, MealImageGM generates visual representations of meal plans to enhance patient engagement, utilizing crowd-sourced feedback to optimize image generation prompts. The overall system process includes extracting data from electronic health records, pre-designed user meal generation prompts, and the generation of personalized meal plans and images. Nutritionists play a crucial role in monitoring patient adherence and preferences, contributing to a continuous learning health system cycle.

Central to this study is the concept of ‘neural cluster knockout’ in LLMs, a method inspired by lesion studies in neuroscience involving the systematic removal of neuron clusters to decipher their role within the model. The research underscores the opaque nature of neural networks, particularly LLMs, which are often critiqued for their ‘black box’ operation. By adopting neuroscience principles, particularly lesion studies, this paper aims to illuminate the inner workings of neural networks, enhancing our understanding of their functionalities. This is crucial in an era increasingly reliant on AI in various sectors, where insights from this study could lead to the development of more efficient, transparent, and accountable AI systems. Methodologically, this study involved Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and neural cluster knockout through iterative zeroing, applied to the Large Language Model named LLaMA. This approach enabled the identification of significant neuron clusters and their functional impacts when deactivated. The results reveal both critical and redundant neurons within LLMs, demonstrating that some clusters are vital for accuracy, while others may impede efficiency or contribute to errors. This research contributes significantly to the AI field, offering a novel perspective on the intricate architecture of LLMs. It lays a foundation for future advancements in AI, envisioning refined and efficient LLMs capable of more accurate and reliable performance.",

Natural Language Generation (NLG) and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) generally create a new poem. But the generative AI has lack of poem originality, has limited content which is failed in generating deeper information on the related topic and heavily struggling to create the new concepts with sequential words. To overcome these issues, the model of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 with fine tuning (GPT-2-FT) is proposed which is coherent for adapting various forms and contexts to avoid nonsensical sequence of text words. Initially, Poem Generation dataset is used, then in preprocessing, input tokens are divided into different individual words and gives it as input to training words. The proposed GPT-2-FT gives an accurate value and also handles the emotions of poem by Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which including generator and discriminator. The proposed GPT-2-FT gives improved results in terms of Coherence, accuracy and fluency which values are given by (8.777), (0.998) and (0.975) respectively than existing Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) model.",

    abstract = "Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, as the core technology in Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, such as self-driving vehicles, make important decisions by performing a variety of data classification or prediction tasks. Attacks on data or algorithms in AI applications can lead to misclassification or misprediction, which can fail the applications. For each dataset separately, the parameters of ML algorithms should be tuned to reach a desirable classification or prediction accuracy. Typically, ML experts tune the parameters empirically, which can be time consuming and does not guarantee the optimal result. To this end, some research suggests an analytical approach to tune the ML parameters for maximum accuracy. However, none of the works consider the ML performance under attack in their tuning process. This paper proposes an analytical framework for tuning the ML parameters to be secure against attacks, while keeping its accuracy high. The framework finds the optimal set of parameters by defining a novel objective function, which takes into account the test results of both ML accuracy and its security against attacks. For validating the framework, an AI application is implemented to recognize whether a subject's eyes are open or closed, by applying k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm on her Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this application, the number of neighbors (k) and the distance metric type, as the two main parameters of kNN, are chosen for tuning. The input data perturbation attack, as one of the most common attacks on ML algorithms, is used for testing the security of the application. Exhaustive search approach is used to solve the optimization problem. The experiment results show k = 43 and cosine distance metric is the optimal configuration of kNN for the EEG dataset, which leads to 83.75\% classification accuracy and reduces the attack success rate to 5.21\%.",

However, AI largely leverages discriminative models relying on labelled and quality data, where data accessibility remains serious concern. Generative AI (GenAI) has gained traction due to its immense potential in resolving the issue of data scarcity, complexity, and incompleteness. GenAI models excel in understanding underlying data distributions, enabling them to generate synthetic data that mirrors real-world patterns. GenAI supports adaptive learning and scenario modeling, making it indispensable for addressing the unpredictability and complexity inherent in 6G networks. Since the complexity of wireless communication systems is increasing and the demand for such systems is growing, GenAI presents new ideas for enhancing network performance, increasing system efficiency, and developing intelligent decision-making capabilities. This survey paper investigates the promising role of GenAI in the evolution of 6G networks. An in-depth discussion of notable GenAI models is presented, outlining their application in enhancing key network components. Specifically, the application of GenAI in advanced technologies including reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), digital twins (DTs), and integrated sensing and communications (ISACs) is thoroughly investigated with respect to optimize the adaptability, flexibility, and robustness of the wireless networks. Moreover, use cases of GenAI-enabled wireless networks are presented to highlight the realization of GenAI in 6G.

Consumer electronics like smartphone and tablet use digital technologies to enhance human’s entertainment and health. The creation of digital content or data augmentation sometimes requires using generative artificial intelligence technologies. Although data generation systems have been successfully used in some consumer products, it is still challenging to create a powerful generative system due to the complexity of input signals and the difficulty of model training. In this paper, a multistage evolutionary generative adversarial network (GAN) framework is proposed to alleviate the above challenges. The multistage evolutionary GAN is a general framework and can be instantiated to existing evolutionary GAN and its variants. Moreover, this paper designs a two-stage and a three-stage evolutionary GAN methods. The two models show that different variation operators and evaluation methods can be used in different stages. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that the proposed methods are effective in capturing complex input signals and alleviating the model training problem. The proposed methods can greatly facilitate the application of image generation systems in consumer products.",

Through the smart mechanisms like the integration of speech-to-text (STR), image-to-text recognition (ITR), and generative-AI, the learners could receive not only lexical resources but also sample sentences generated by AI (AI-GS) to inspire them to make meaningful writing. A total of 71 undergraduate students from two classes were assigned to two groups. The experimental group (EG) learns with Smart UEnglish including ITR, STR, and AI-GS. Meanwhile, the control group (CG) learns with ITR and STR only. The mix-method was used to analyze the study deeply. The results found that the EG outperformed the CG in the posttest.

The sensitivity of medical records poses challenges for data access and sharing, making GAI a promising solution. The study evaluates five key approaches—StyleGAN2, CLIP, T5, ViT, and specialized Tabular GANs—across three critical dimensions: distribution fidelity, attribute correlation preservation, and pattern recognition accuracy. The results reveal the strengths and limitations of each technique in generating realistic medical data. StyleGAN2, CLIP, and T5 excel in all dimensions, making them ideal for various applications requiring high-quality synthetic medical datasets. ViT shows promise but may need fine-tuning for specific use cases, while specialized Tabular GANs demonstrate potential but vary in performance. This comparative analysis provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners at the intersection of Generative AI and healthcare data generation. It underscores the potential of Generative AI in addressing the tabular data generation challenge in medical records, offering realistic and privacy-conscious alternatives for data utilization and model training.",

This article investigates a potential threat from adversarial AI in blind false data injection attacks (FDIA) targeting the ac state estimators in the smart grid. Assuming no access to the grid topology required in most FDIA, we propose an adversarial model based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) to infer grid topology from historical measurements. Following the topology inference, a substitute bad data detector (BDD) model is further proposed in the attack model to filter the false data before injection, reducing the risk of detection given potential bad data in normal operations. We also refine the common evaluation of FDI stealthiness by including the presence of bad data among normal and false data when assessing the detection performance. Simulations on the IEEE 30-bus system reveal that significant deviations can be inflicted stealthily by the proposed blind FDI attack. Detailed analyses of the stealthiness, impacts, and parameters are also presented to shed more light on the threats for further studies and effective countermeasures.",

Using affordance theory as a conceptual lens, we conducted observational studies and semi-structured interviews with DT experts to identify AI's action potentials, constraints, and mitigation strategies in this context. Our findings highlight four key affordances of AI in DT workshops: enhanced creativity, support for analytical tasks, facilitation of task initiation, and acceleration of processes. However, these benefits are tempered by challenges, including reduced team collaboration, diminished ownership of AI-generated outputs, and disruptions to workshop flow. The study reveals distinct human-AI interaction archetypes, underscoring the dynamic interplay between human expertise and AI capabilities. To mitigate constraints, we propose strategies such as pre-preparing AI-generated content, defining clear roles for AI and human inputs, and fostering collaborative reflection on AI outputs.

Functional connectivity (FC) derived from resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) serves as a crucial tool in revealing functional connectivity patterns associated with MDD, playing an essential role in precise diagnosis. However, the limited data availability of FC poses challenges for robust MDD diagnosis. To tackle this, some studies have employed Deep Neural Networks (DNN) architectures to construct Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic FC generation, but this tends to overlook the inherent topology characteristics of FC. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)-based Conditional GAN with Class-Aware Discriminator (GC-GAN). GC-GAN utilizes GCN in both the generator and discriminator to capture intricate FC patterns among brain regions, and the class-aware discriminator ensures the diversity and quality of the generated synthetic FC. Additionally, we introduce a topology refinement technique to enhance MDD diagnosis performance by optimizing the topology using the augmented FC dataset. Our framework was evaluated on publicly available rs-fMRI datasets, and the results demonstrate that GC-GAN outperforms existing methods. This indicates the superior potential of GCN in capturing intricate topology characteristics and generating high-fidelity synthetic FC, thus contributing to a more robust MDD diagnosis.",

To address these challenges, we propose the GAI-oriented synthetic network (GaisNet), a collaborative cloud-edge-end intelligence framework that integrates fine-tuning and inference. GaisNet, specifically, can mitigate contradictions by leveraging data-free knowledge relays, where bidirectional knowledge flow facilitates a virtuous cycle of model fine-tuning and task inference with a long-term perspective, fostering mutualism between GAI and EI in the IIoV. A case study illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the future challenges and directions in the interplay between GAI and EI.",

It identifies and highlights the role of different stakeholders (university management, students, staff, etc.) during the adoption process. It also proposes an objective approach based upon an evaluation matrix to assess the success and outcome of the GenAI adoption. Background: Universities worldwide are debating and struggling with the adoption of GenAI in their curriculum. GenAI has impacted our perspective on traditional methods of academic integrity and the scholarship of teaching, learning, and research. Both the faculty and students are unsure about the approach in the absence of clear guidelines through the administration and regulators. This requires an established framework to define a process and articulate the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder involved. Research Questions: Whether the academic ecosystem requires a methodology to adopt GenAI into its curriculum? A systematic approach for the academic staff to ensure the students’ learning outcomes are met with the adoption of GenAI. How to measure and communicate the adoption of GenAI in the university setup? Methodology: The methodology employed in this study focuses on examining the university education system and assessing the opportunities and challenges related to incorporating GenAI in teaching and learning. Additionally, it identifies a gap and the absence of a comprehensive framework that obstructs the effective integration of GenAI within the academic environment. Findings: The literature survey results indicate the limited or no adoption of GenAI by the university, which further reflects the dilemma in the minds of different stakeholders. For the successful adoption of GenAI, a standard framework is proposed 1) for effective redesign of the course curriculum; 2) for enabling staff and students; and 3) to define an evaluation matrix to measure the effectiveness and success of the adoption process.",

This innovative practice full paper presents a study into using GenAI to enhance student learning of software engineering. It outlines the initiatives to introduce GenAI into a graduate-level software engineering course in Software Verification and Validation (SV\&V). The paper presents the educational goals, methodologies and findings of these endeavors in this course. The primary education goal of this course is that students have a solid understanding of principles and practices of software quality assurance and seek to introduce students to diverse techniques employed for SV\&V. The study presented in this paper centers on the practical application of GenAI within the domain of testing strategies. The paper introduces the findings of an exercise where GenAI was used to apply testing strategies for unit testing. The exercise consisted of the use of GenAI in the development of unit tests for an algorithm. Rigorous assessments were conducted to gauge the effectiveness of the unit tests developed for validating the accurate implementation of the algorithm. This exploration shed light on the tangible impact of GenAI on the precision and efficiency of unit testing procedures. The findings underscore the significance of encouraging students to actively explore emerging trends and methodologies in the realm of software verification and validation. By incorporating GenAI into the educational framework, students not only gain insights into the capabilities and limitations of this technology but also foster a mindset of continuous learning in software quality assurance. The paper demonstrates that it is not sufficient to use the test cases developed by GenAI for software validation since test cases recommended by GenAI do not cover corner cases which causes gaps in coverage in unit testing. The majority of the students were able to understand the limitation of GenAI in SV\&V but appreciated its support in suggesting test cases for the most common cases. This exercise allowed students to enhance their creative problem-solving through human-guided AI partnership which is pivotal in cultivating a new generation of professionals capable of contributing to the ongoing evolution of software quality.",

In the Green Phase, the TDD developer writes production code to make the test pass as quickly as possible. Finally, in the refactor phase, the TDD developer “cleans” written code. In this demo paper, we present GAI4-TDD (Generative Artificial Intelligence for Test-Driven Development), a PyCharm plugin to support the Green Phase of TDD. Specifically, this plugin generates production code from the tests the TDD developer had written in the Red Phase so that the generated code makes these tests pass. Previous studies have shown that TDD can be beneficial not only in the “traditional” software development context but also in the Embedded Systems (ESs) development context. We preliminary assessed GAI4-TDD in the latter context through a laboratory empirical study on three ESs. We observed that in the greater part of the cases, GAI4- TDD generates production code that successfully implements the chunk of functionality required.

A central challenge in this field lies in bridging textual analysis with the spatial and sensory dimensions of settings described or implied in texts. Traditional methodologies often require scholars to mentally reconstruct these environments, leading to incomplete or inconsistent interpretations. Readers may be biased by their personal context or experiences, or may lack detailed knowledge of the relevant historical facts. This paper argues for the integration of virtual reality and generative artificial intelligence as supporting instruments to enhance literary research.

Recently, there is no area where AI and its applications are not used in daily life, from health to education, from transportation to energy, and from agriculture to tourism. AI applications are making rapid progress in the direction of important and current developments, especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL). A concrete example of progress in these areas is the GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) language model. AI-assisted GPT-3 technology is the DL model that is effectively used in many NLP fields, which can produce long and consistent content similar to the texts written by people using pre-trained algorithms. The GPT-3 architecture has reached a level that can compete with people in many areas by producing optimum solutions for all kinds of inputs by using the Transformer-based language model, which is an attention-based deep learning technique. This article aims to convey the efficiency, structure and potential of the Transformer-assisted GPT-3 model, which is one of the most up-to-date NLP technologies, to the reader. Since the number of Turkish studies in the field of GPT-3 AI is quite limited, it is considered that this study will contribute to the literature in terms of both quantity and quality.

This module not only establishes feature relationship between different locations, but also provides adaptive feature weights to highlight key information. Next, by embedding the hybrid attention module into the generative adversarial network, an improved generative adversarial network model is developed.

As the need for deep learning algorithms that can handle more complicated tasks keeps growing very quickly, the improvements in how efficient and productive these algorithms can be utilized for identifying data poisoning is an important step. Data poisoning refers to altering the legitimate data using various techniques and fabricating the expected results. The poisoning will affect the quality of predictions and reliability of the contents generated. The data sensitive applications which rely on classification models for deriving conclusions will be affected by poisoning resulting in unrealistic conclusions and misguided inferences. Continuous occurrence of poorly classified data and unrealistic conclusions will affect the reliability of the system making it less trustworthy. This research looks into long lasting effects of poisoning attacks, which target the training data used in deep learning and assess the way a deep learning model classifies information. Experiments were done to measure the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms in effectively detecting poisoned data. The evaluations were done using KNN, SVM and Logistic Regression models. The analysis concludes that KNN offers better prediction compared to SVM and Logistic Regression. Logistic regression offers less accurate predictions making it unfit for poisoning detection. Proper classification of poisoned data will help research community and users to be aware of legitimacy of data and thereby help them to choose the right data and information for processing, analytics, and deriving conclusions. This will greatly improve the performance and trustworthiness of related models including generative AI systems and makes the learning process un biased which will highly benefit the research community in general.",

The results showed that ChatGPT does not store previous inputs and is not able to reconstruct personal data retroactively if they were not explicitly provided to it in each request.

The primary purpose of this research is to examine and understand the factors influencing user acceptance and behavioral intentions towards generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in the design field. To achieve this, this research delineates a multifaceted theoretical model, underpinned by an analysis of user behavioral intentions and their driving factors. The model encapsulates eight principal constructs: intention to continue use, self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, satisfaction, facilitating conditions, expectation confirmation, trust in technology, and social influence. An empirical examination of 13 related hypotheses was conducted. Utilizing data from 339 valid questionnaires, the outcomes of the structural equation modeling lent support to all posited hypotheses. The research delineates that users’ sustained intention to utilize generative AI technology is directly contingent upon factors such as perceived usefulness, satisfaction, self-efficacy, and trust in technology. Notably, perceived usefulness and self-efficacy are identified as pivotal determinants of satisfaction. Furthermore, social influence and expectation confirmation are found to augment perceived usefulness, while facilitating conditions to enhance both self-efficacy and expectation confirmation. These findings yield novel insights into the theory of user behavior, charting a course for the refinement of generative AI design tools. Such enhancements are aimed at fostering a more extensive application and acceptance of these tools in the relevant fields.",

The reason is that these conventional assisting devices only address the obstacle avoidance problem. They do not provide visually impaired people with a global perception of the surrounding environment. In this article, a new generative adversarial network (GAN) model is developed to effectively transform the ground images into the tactile signal, which can be displayed by an off-the-shelf vibration device. The algorithm module and the hardware are integrated into a portable device, which provides visually impaired people with effective surrounding perception capability. In addition, a visual-tactile cross-modal data set is constructed to train the proposed deep-learning architecture. Experimental results show that the proposed system can help visually impaired people sense the ground and bring a better traveling experience for them. Note to Practitioners—This article presents a portable device that provides tactile recognition assistance for visually impaired people. Such a technology can be extensively used in tactile mouse and white cane. The developed technology can be extensively used for various industrial applications, such as surrounding monitoring and manipulation. The proposed work demonstrates the promising ability of artificial intelligence in healthcare applications. The generated tactile signals are expected to be used in many human-centered systems, and we believe that our contribution is an important step toward the development of a more comprehensive assisting technology for visually impaired people.",

Therefore, knowing how these models work is vital to understanding the mechanisms of how AI tools are built. AI systems are built on algorithms that enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time. For machine learning to be effective, it needs the proper training data set. The model is built from machines that use algorithms to learn from the data provided. In supervised learning, algorithms learn from labeled data to make predictions or classifications. Unsupervised learning uses algorithms that find patterns or structures in unlabeled data. Discriminative AI seeks to classify and differentiate data, essentially learning the differences between different categories of data. Training generative AI models often involve unsupervised learning, enabling the model to digest and understand large amounts of text, images, or videos.</p>",

As a part of this study, a group of sophomore-year engineering students were assigned a set of electronics circuit problems to solve first using traditional methods, followed by repeating the process using ChatGPT. Their experience was captured in a questionnaire-based survey, which attempted to gauge the perceived efficacy of ChatGPT or similar generative AI in electronics circuit problem-solving against the traditional problem-solving method under five criteria: accuracy, efficiency, learning retention, user experience, and assistance in critical thinking, using a 5-scale evaluation method. Additionally, some open-ended questions were included in the study for a qualitative assessment of ChatGPT’s perceived efficacy. The outcome of this exploratory research prompted a critical examination of the application of generative AI and similar assistive tools in the electronics course. Through the qualitative assessment, this study also identified several potential factors contributing to the observed performance differences between traditional and AI-assisted learning and problem-solving. Results from this study highlighted ChatGPT’s inherent strengths in efficiency and speed, while frequently compromising accuracy by being prone to errors and misinformation. Participants also emphasized the human factor of learning and advocated for the active involvement of instructors in training students in the proper and effective use of AI and similar assistive tools.

Using lag sequence analysis, the study analyzes reflective behavior patterns based on 66 pre-service teachers' reflective texts on microteaching. The results indicate that generative AI-supported teacher comments significantly optimize pre-service teachers' reflective behavior patterns, particularly in terms of breadth and depth. The experimental group's reflective behaviors covered multiple dimensions, including teaching content (CW), teaching process and methods (PW), classroom atmosphere (AW), and teaching evaluation and feedback (EW), demonstrating comprehensiveness. Additionally, their reflective behaviors formed problem chains, such as "teaching content → teaching process → classroom atmosphere" (CW→PW→AW), reflecting stronger logic and depth. In contrast, the control group's reflective behaviors primarily focused on basic teaching skills (BW) and teaching process and methods (PW), with insufficient attention to classroom atmosphere (AW) and teaching evaluation and feedback (EW). Their reflections were more superficial and limited. Based on these findings, the study proposes recommendations to optimize pre-service teachers' reflective behavior patterns, aiming to enhance their microteaching reflection abilities and, consequently, their teaching competence development.},

Studies conducted between 2022 and 2024 have proved the capability of such models in detecting vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, existing GAN based methods are confronted by various challenges, such as high cost, scalability issues, unstable training, and slow responsiveness to newly emerging exploit attacks, rendering real-time detection of threats less efficient. This project proposes an improved GAN architecture tackling such problems through a hybrid approach merging Conditional or Wasserstein GANs and Reinforcement Learning, Vulnerability Intelligence, Graph Neural Networks, and Autoencoders. This stabilizes training, minimizes computation overhead, and maximizes flexibility to new exploit methods. Our model, with this architecture, will be able to provide more precise detection of zero-day exploits, strengthening cybersecurity defenses beyond existing techniques.

Recent studies have leveraged artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for malware detection and classification. However, applying such approaches, particularly deep learning (DL) techniques, to mobile malware detection poses significant challenges. These challenges arise from the difficulty of collecting large quantities of mobile malware samples and the inherent class imbalance in the collected datasets. To tackle these issues and enhance the performance of machine learning (ML) and DL detection models, we propose novel detection models based on a generative adversarial network (GAN). Furthermore, our approach not only employs a conditional tabular GAN (CTGAN) for data augmentation to explore the impact of augmentation but also identifies the optimal multiplication factor for achieving the best results. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed data augmentation approach significantly improves the performance of mobile malware detection models, especially those based on DL. We have notably figured out that doubling the original dataset is sufficient to enhance the performance of ML models, whereas DL models require additional data to achieve optimal results. Hence, our proposed mechanism is an effective solution for improving mobile malware detection.",

This cognitive ability enhances their grasp of the content and augments their overall enjoyment. Consequently, the development of an automated system aimed at producing visually faithful images based on textual descriptions, often referred to as the text-to-image task, stands as a profoundly meaningful endeavor. For this reason, a variety of text-to-image generating artificial intelligences (AIs) have been devised until now. Nevertheless, the generative AIs introduced thus far encounter an issue wherein they struggle to uphold the coherence of input sentences, particularly when multiple sentences are provided. Within this paper, we present a remedy to this challenge through the application of prompt editing. Furthermore, our experimental results substantiate that our proposed solution more effectively preserves contextual coherence among the generated images in comparison to other preexisting generative artificial intelligence models.

In order to improve the energy efficiency for UAV-assisted wireless networks, we focus on the following three aspects: the UAVs trajectory planning; caching, computing, and communication resource allocation of UAVs; and 3D hovering location decision of UAVs. We discuss each aspect and reveal the corresponding optimization problem of energy efficiency. We also explore several promising deep-learning-based AI methods, which include pointer network, federated deep learning, and multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient, to solve these optimization problems. Through case studies, we verify the superiority of the proposed AI methods to save UAVs' energy and decrease the system delay.",

    abstract = "Despite the advancements that have come out of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom and subsequent generative AI race, there are a significant number of problems under the surface. With the rise of AI generators in social media and pop culture, these problems amplify as the demand for AI tools skyrockets. These solutions regularly exhibit harmful biases and stereotypes deeply embedded in the data developers use to train AI models. Perhaps exacerbating the immediacy of the issue, generative AI models can create highly realistic imagery, empowering users with malicious intent. This paper explores the pervasive issue of bias in generative AI and its implications. It also examines how these models, often trained on biased datasets, can unintentionally amplify, replicate, and reinforce harmful biases and stereotypes. Additionally, it delves into the objectification of individuals, particularly women, and in a novel study, discusses how a popular TikTok filter that uses generative AI exhibits gender and racial biases while excessively sexualizing its users. While research on AI bias is forthcoming, existing literature referenced throughout this paper underscores its presence across various systems. This paper demonstrates the continued propagation of AI bias as these systems expand and iterate, often with inadequate mitigation efforts. It advocates for ethical considerations, accountability, and transparency in generative AI design and data selection. The Author proposes a novel framework called the Stereotypes, Objectification, Racism, and Datasets (SORD) Framework. The SORD Framework is proposed as a lens to examine the multifaceted dimensions of bias in generative AI. By critically analyzing these components, this paper aims to shed light on the ethical implications of biased generative AI, stimulate thoughtful discussions regarding responsible AI development, and provoke the lengthy process of removing bias from the systems and training datasets to eliminate AI bias at the source. Furthermore, it calls for collaboration among developers, researchers, and engineers to advance research, mitigate biases, and promote algorithmic fairness using the SORD Framework. Future work includes refining the SORD framework and assessing its effectiveness. Lastly, the Author underscores the pivotal role of engineering education in nurturing ethical AI practices, empowering future engineers to address societal challenges stemming from biased datasets and AI systems.",

In data mining, an Anomaly Detection (AD) is an essential part which helps to determine behavior within the data and helps to detect network intrusion. The existing AD in network traffic has identified outliers in unbalanced datasets and difficult to train the model. Therefore, this paper introduces Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based on Minimax Loss Function for detecting anomalies in network traffic. Initially, this paper uses Neural Simulation Language-Knowledge Discovery in Databases (NSL-KDD) dataset which contains attacks and are preprocessed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality. After that, these features are processed using the Information Gain (IG) algorithm for eliminating irrelevant features and then anomalies are detected by the proposed GAN-Minimax loss function which effectively identifies outliers, handles imbalanced data and trains the model effectively. The proposed GAN-Minimax resulted in high accuracy as 99.92\% when compared with existing K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method.",

Training SR3 from scratch using the ImageNet dataset involves a complex process that requires substantial computational resources and expertise. The idea is applied the trained SR3 model to new images by feeding the low-resolution inputs and obtaining the high-resolution outputs. It's important to note that training SR3 from scratch is a resource-intensive process that requires powerful GPUs and significant computation time. If you do not have access to such resources, an alternative is to use pre-trained models that are already available and fine-tune them on specific datasets or tasks.

We need appropriate datasets to obtain the maximum accuracy from the artificial neural network technique. The findings of this experiment show that feature extraction is required for the datasets to be trained to obtain a high accuracy value. The mean, median, maximum, minimum, skew, and kurtosis values are the feature that are extracted. In addition to employing feature extraction, it is crucial to modify the algorithm model. The experimental setup that uses “sigmoid” activation on the input layer, the three hidden layers, and the output layer yields the best accuracy when all feature are extracted, with training to test ratio of 90\% to 10\%. This is demonstrated by the exceptional training accuracy and testing accuracy values, which are 99.85 percent for training accuracy and 99.12 percent for validation accuracy.

    abstract = "In an era where technology plays a significant role in the lives of people of all ages, adapting to rapidly advancing technology is essential. Lifelong learning, which integrates formal, non-formal, and informal education, helps learners develop skills and abilities independently. Programming skills serve as an example of lifelong learning, requiring the development of technical skills such as programming, planning, and testing, as well as communication, teamwork, and systematic thinking. This research focuses on utilizing Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) to enhance programming skills through self-directed learning combined with interactive learning. The study was conducted with 21 students enrolled in the Higher Vocational Certificate (Diploma) program in Mechatronics and Robotics. The study applied the MAR model, which consists of three stages: The motivation stage, is designed to encourage learners to engage in activities that link prior knowledge or experiences with new knowledge, thereby fostering self-directed learning motivation, such as designing personalized learning activities based on individual interests; the Activity stage, which provides opportunities for learners to use Generative AI technology for self-directed learning according to their goals and plans, enabling them to understand concepts, apply knowledge in various situations, and track their learning progress; and the Reflection and Progress stage, focusing on reviewing, analyzing, and reflecting on learning outcomes, as well as exchanging ideas and skills with peers and receiving constructive feedback. These stages were designed based on theoretical foundations and a literature review. Furthermore, the research emphasized ethical considerations in AI use, such as data privacy and societal impacts, to promote high-quality, beneficial lifelong learning. The findings showed that before the learning process, the learner had no background in programming and had never used AI technology. However, after participating in the learning activities, students became more open to learning and responded positively to the self-designed activities, which aligned with their interests and skills related to their field of study. These findings suggest that this learning process, when implemented effectively, can be applied to lifelong learning for individuals of all genders and ages.",

This study examines the effectiveness of the ChatGPT prompt framework in improving text analysis skills among students, specifically targeting readability, accuracy, completeness, logicality, and critical thinking. Conducted among high school students in Canada, the research assesses how GAI prompt frameworks significantly affect the quality of students’ analytical responses. Results showed significant improvements in all five aspects of readability, accuracy, completeness, logicality, and critical thinking, especially for students with no prior knowledge of the topic. However, enhancements in completeness and critical thinking were less pronounced, suggesting that while the ChatGPT framework substantially supports basic analytical skills, its effectiveness varies depending on the complexity of cognitive tasks and the extent of students’ existing knowledge. The study underscores the significant role that advanced GAI tools can play in modern educational environments, promoting deeper engagement with learning materials and enhancing students’ analytical abilities. It highlights the necessity of integrating these technologies to cater to diverse learning needs and cognitive challenges.",

Although the concept of generating content was invented long back, the latest breakthroughs in neural network architectures have made it possible to implement this concept at a much faster pace. With the availability of vast amounts of data and computational power, it has become increasingly feasible. Generative models aim to generate new data resembling the training data distribution by learning its underlying patterns. They capture the inherent complexity of the data to produce outputs similar to the training examples. Discriminative models, on the other hand, focus on learning boundaries between different classes or categories within the data. The maritime industry is a major contributor to the global economy, but it is also a high-risk industry, as it is exposed to a variety of hazards. Generative AI can be used to improve maritime safety and efficiency in several ways. Although the maritime industry is still in the early stages of adopting generative AI, the potential benefits are significant. The integration of generative AI into maritime operations plays an increasingly important role in the maritime industry.

This paper compares three methods for generating Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs): (1) without the use of generative AI, (2) with unguided usage of ChatGPT, and (3) with a specialized AI-powered micro-app designed specifically for MCQ generation. The micro-app, named the "MCQ Generator", allows users to set preferences such as difficulty level, number of distractors, and inclusion of hints/feedback, tailoring the final prompt based on these selections. Our study involves instructional designers creating MCQs for hypothetical courses, with educators then evaluating the quality of these questions using a rubric-based approach. The results reveal that AI-assisted methods significantly enhance the efficiency and quality of MCQ generation compared to non-AI methods. Notably, the micro-app demonstrates potential advantages over ChatGPT, offering a more user-friendly interface and a lower barrier to entry for educators. These findings suggest that while ChatGPT can enhance the MCQ creation process, AI micro-apps may provide more tailored functionalities that further streamline educators’ workflows. This paper presents empirical evidence on the utility of AI in educational content development. By doing so, it contributes to the broader discourse on the transformative potential of AI in educational assessment, with a particular focus on online education.

This study examined the key challenges encountered by college lecturers in the AI environment and the practical solutions they offered for these challenges. Seventeen heads of departments or academic units from a teacher education college participated in this study. Data were collected through a video-recorded focus group interview and supplemented reports. Data were analyzed inductively using the constant comparison method to identify recurring themes and patterns across the participants. The findings revealed five central challenges faced by college lecturers: (1) Assessment integrity that includes difficulties in verifying student authenticity, increasing plagiarism risks, and diminishing academic originality; (2) AI adoption resistance characterized by reluctance or hesitancy in embracing AI technologies stemming from limited familiarity and a lack of confidence; (3) Pedagogical adaptation imperative that necessitates the revision of instructional methodologies and a redefinition of the lecturer's role in the context of AI integration; (4) Technological literacy disparities that refer to gaps in digital literacy among both faculty and students, compound by unequal familiarity with AI tools; and (5) Limited institutional resources that result in restricted access to advanced AI tools and insufficient professional development opportunities. In response to these challenges, the participants proposed several potential solutions: fostering transparent and ethical student utilization of AI tools, implementing alternative assessment strategies focused on personal and critical thinking skills, enhancing institutional support through ICT centers, offering structured training programs, and ensuring equitable access to AI platforms. So, colleges need to open dialogue and collaboration among faculty members to develop shared guidelines and best practices for the ethical and effective use of AI in academic settings. In addition, teaching should focus more on thinking critically and personal skills, which are especially essential in the AI environment.",

    abstract = "Fusion design is an innovative design approach in product color design. The fusion design makes the color matching richer. It not only can be simultaneously with a variety of styles but also fully express the design concept. However, the manual completion of the fusion design process takes time and effort. With the development of artificial intelligence, some designers apply intelligent algorithms to fusion design and significantly improve design efficiency. However, most design methods only achieve style migration from the source domain product style to the target domain product in one direction, leading to the resulting design solution losing some of the style information of the target domain product. We propose a color-style fusion design method based on generative adversarial networks. Take the eyeshadow color design as an example. Firstly, the source domain art painting dataset and the target domain eyeshadow dataset are collected, and the CycleGAN extracts the color styles of both to fuse to generate an eyeshadow color scheme with artistic style. The experimental results show that the proposed method can meet the color design concept of color cosmetics and retain the original art painting color style, providing a reference for designers and a new idea for product fusion design.",

    abstract = "Recent advances in diffusion models have opened new avenues for research into embodied AI agents and robotics. Despite significant achievements in complex robotic locomotion and skills, mobile manipulation–a capability that requires the coordination of navigation and manipulation–remains a challenge for generative AI techniques. This is primarily due to the high-dimensional action space, extended motion trajectories, and interactions with the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce M2 Diffuser, a diffusion-based, scene-conditioned generative model that directly generates coordinated and efficient whole-body motion trajectories for mobile manipulation based on robot-centric 3D scans. M2 Diffuser first learns trajectory-level distributions from mobile manipulation trajectories provided by an expert planner. Crucially, it incorporates an optimization module that can flexibly accommodate physical constraints and task objectives, modeled as cost and energy functions, during the inference process. This enables the reduction of physical violations and execution errors at each denoising step in a fully differentiable manner. Through benchmarking on three types of mobile manipulation tasks across over 20 scenes, we demonstrate that M2 Diffuser outperforms state-of-the-art neural planners and successfully transfers the generated trajectories to a real-world robot. Our evaluations underscore the potential of generative AI to enhance the generalization of traditional planning and learning-based robotic methods, while also highlighting the critical role of enforcing physical constraints for safe and robust execution.

For example, generating SQL sentences that are capable of detecting a cyber-attack from a set of metrics available in a database table. Two solutions are needed to achieve so, a tool that enables and performs the syntactically valid generation of SQL sentences and an (Artificial intelligence) AI algorithm able to guide the semantics of such generations to the achievement of the best sentences for the intended purpose. The main contribution of this manuscript is the first of these solutions. To be concrete, this paper proposes a tool to enable and generate syntactic-valid language sentences. The tool can deal with any language defined as an ANTLR4 EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form) grammar. The paper also provides a methodology to help achieve an EBNF grammar suitable for addressing concerns related to ambiguity and recursion as a direct result of the generation process. The paper further implements a prototype utilizing ANTLR4’s recognizer and its Augmented Transition Network for language generation using EBNF grammars. In-depth design and logic implementation are provided, showcasing areas of interest for AI integration. The achieved prototype showed an ability to easily generate syntactically valid SQL statements at various depths, with observable problems becoming more apparent during the exponential recursive growth. Our mitigation controls for such scenarios proved to be successful and were able to complete the recursion whilst also moving the push-down automata forward until query completion. Experimental validation was performed against a SQL EBNF grammar feeding the generated SQL statement into an SQL parser to validate the syntax.",

There are two distinct differences between the photon therapy and particle therapy: 1) beam interaction physics (photons versus charged particles) and 2) beam delivery mode (e.g., IMRT/VMAT versus pencil beam scanning). Consequently, different strategies of AI deployment are required for these two radiotherapy modalities.

We're combining two powerful technologies, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML), to shake up how we handle medical images and reports. First up, we're using GANs to make medical images sharper and more useful. Thinkof it like giving doctors super-clear glasses to spot details that might be hard to see otherwise. Then, we're using AIML to predict diseases by looking at these images and other patient info. It's like having a crystal ball that helps doctors catch problems before they get serious. But that's not all. We're also creating a smart system that writes brief but super-helpfulsummaries of these medical reports. It's like having an assistant who reads all the details and pulls out the most important parts, making it easier for doctors to decide what's next. By bringing together these technologies, we're not just making diagnoses more accurate and predicting diseases sooner, but we're also making sure doctors get the key info they need quickly. It's all about making healthcare smarter and more efficient for everyone involved especially for elderly and especially abled people.",

This paper explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize color restoration in historical artworks. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), AI systems can analyze faded paintings and reconstruct their original hues with unprecedented precision. Using large datasets of high-resolution images, these algorithms learn patterns of pigment degradation and stylistic nuances inherent to specific artists or periods. The study highlights how AI models, trained on multispectral and hyperspectral imaging data, can infer the original color schemes by detecting remnants of pigments invisible to the naked eye. Moreover, AI-driven simulations offer insights into artistic intent and historical contexts, enabling restorers to make informed decisions. This interdisciplinary approach merges art history, chemistry, and computer science, fostering a new era of cultural heritage preservation. The findings underscore AI's transformative role in safeguarding the visual integrity of humanity's artistic legacy while maintaining the ethical considerations of artistic authenticity and conservation standards.",

Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the SG-126 power grid simulator under three representative scenarios to evaluate the performance and generalization capability of GARL. The results show that GARL can learn the distribution characteristics of stateaction-reward sequence from historical experience, establish the mapping relationship between current state and future cumulative reward, and improve the accuracy of future power grid operation trend prediction, which is always better than the independent DDPG algorithm.

Drawing on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Social Support Theory (SST), the research examines perceived usefulness, ease of use, and support measures, including educational and emotional support. The study was conducted at King Saud University, where it adopted a quantitative approach, collecting data from 350 participants through a structured survey. A final sample of 308 valid responses was analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The findings revealed significant relationships between key constructs: perceived educational support positively influenced perceived usefulness ( $\beta = 0.160$ , p = 0.000) and attitudes toward AI ( $\beta = 0.140$ , p = 0.010). Perceived usefulness ( $\beta = 0.670$ , p = 0.000) and ease of use ( $\beta = 0.330$ , p = 0.000) were strong predictors of positive attitudes, which, in turn, significantly shaped intentions to use AI ( $\beta = 0.760$ , p = 0.000). Emotional support and cognitive support also had notable but mixed effects on perceived usefulness. However, social interaction support and perceived enjoyment did not demonstrate significant influence. These findings highlight the importance of designing AI systems that emphasise usability and provide robust educational and emotional support to enhance acceptance. The study contributes to theory by extending TAM with constructs from SST, offering new insights into AI adoption in academic contexts. Practically, the results guide policymakers and developers in fostering AI acceptance by addressing educational and emotional needs, ensuring effective implementation in higher education.",

    abstract = "Providing rich, constructive feedback to students is essential for supporting and enhancing their learning. Recent advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly with large language models (LLMs), present new opportunities to deliver scalable, repeatable, and instant feedback, effectively making abundant a resource that has historically been scarce and costly. From a technical perspective, this approach is now feasible due to breakthroughs in AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP). While the potential educational benefits are compelling, implementing these technologies also introduces a host of ethical considerations that must be thoughtfully addressed. One of the core advantages of AI systems is their ability to automate routine and mundane tasks, potentially freeing up human educators for more nuanced work. However, the ease of automation risks a “tyranny of the majority”, where the diverse needs of minority or unique learners are overlooked, as they may be harder to systematize and less straightforward to accommodate. Ensuring inclusivity and equity in AI-generated feedback, therefore, becomes a critical aspect of responsible AI implementation in education. The process of developing machine learning models that produce valuable, personalized, and authentic feedback also requires significant input from human domain experts. Decisions around whose expertise is incorporated, how it is captured, and when it is applied have profound implications for the relevance and quality of the resulting feedback. Additionally, the maintenance and continuous refinement of these models are necessary to adapt feedback to evolving contextual, theoretical, and student-related factors. Without ongoing adaptation, feedback risks becoming obsolete or mismatched with the current needs of diverse student populations. Addressing these challenges is essential not only for ethical integrity but also for building the operational trust needed to integrate AI-driven systems as valuable tools in contemporary education. Thoughtful planning and deliberate choices are needed to ensure that these solutions truly benefit all students, allowing AI to support an inclusive and dynamic learning environment.",

The results of EDA reveal that the complex patterns within the data can be better captured by discriminative classification models and this was endorsed by performing back-testing on two securities using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forests (RF) as discriminative models against their counterpart Naïve Bayes as a generative model. To enhance the learning process, the new reward loss function is utilized to retrain the ANN with testing on AAPL, IBM, BRENT CRUDE and BTC using auto-trading strategy that serves as the intelligent unit, and the results indicate this loss superiorly outperforms the conventional cross-entropy used in predictive models. The overall results of this work suggest that there should be larger focus on EDA and more practical losses in the research of machine learning modelling for stock market prediction applications.",

    abstract = "Lifelong learning describes an ability that enables humans to continually acquire and learn new information without forgetting. This capability, common to humans and animals, has lately been identified as an essential function for an artificial intelligence system aiming to learn continuously from a stream of data during a certain period of time. However, modern neural networks suffer from degenerated performance when learning multiple domains sequentially and fail to recognize past learned tasks after being retrained. This corresponds to catastrophic forgetting and is ultimately induced by replacing the parameters associated with previously learned tasks with new values. One approach in lifelong learning is the generative replay mechanism (GRM) that trains a powerful generator as the generative replay network, implemented by a variational autoencoder (VAE) or a generative adversarial network (GAN). In this article, we study the forgetting behavior of GRM-based learning systems by developing a new theoretical framework in which the forgetting process is expressed as an increase in the model’s risk during the training. Although many recent attempts have provided high-quality generative replay samples by using GANs, they are limited to mainly downstream tasks due to the lack of inference. Inspired by the theoretical analysis while aiming to address the drawbacks of existing approaches, we propose the lifelong generative adversarial autoencoder (LGAA). LGAA consists of a generative replay network and three inference models, each addressing the inference of a different type of latent variable. The experimental results show that LGAA learns novel visual concepts without forgetting and can be applied to a wide range of downstream tasks.",

In this paper, we propose a novel GAN framework called evolutionary GANs (E-GANs) for stable GAN training and improved generative performance. Unlike existing GANs, which employ a predefined adversarial objective function alternately training a generator and a discriminator, we evolve a population of generators to play the adversarial game with the discriminator. Different adversarial training objectives are employed as mutation operations and each individual (i.e., generator candidature) are updated based on these mutations. Then, we devise an evaluation mechanism to measure the quality and diversity of generated samples, such that only well-performing generator(s) are preserved and used for further training. In this way, E-GAN overcomes the limitations of an individual adversarial training objective and always preserves the well-performing offspring, contributing to progress in, and the success of GANs. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that E-GAN achieves convincing generative performance and reduces the training problems inherent in existing GANs.",

In this work, we investigate the synthesis of realistic and superior chest X-ray pictures using Deep Convolutional neural networks Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN). A vital diagnosing technique for breathing problems disorders is chest X-ray imaging, and the development and assessment of AI-based medical devices can benefit from a greater amount of numerous, artificially produced information. We offer a novel method that creates synthetic chest Xray pictures that closely replicate real radiography data by utilizing DCGAN, a generative model architecture. Our solution is based on a two-step process: a discriminator network and a generator. The discriminator discerns among real and fake pictures, while a generator trains to produce accurate images of the chest. Through an intensive training regimen, these two networks continuously enhance the standard of the pictures they produce. We ran comprehensive tests on a variety of chest X-ray image datasets to confirm the efficacy of our methodology. Our DCGAN model produced artificial pictures that bore striking visual similarities to actual X-ray images of the chest, including radiographic noise, disease patterns, and anatomical features. In order to statistically evaluate the diversity and realism of the created photos, we also used a variety of assessment measures, which we used to show that our model created extremely convincing synthetic data. The synthesised chest X-ray pictures might be useful assets for expanding on small datasets, which will help build strong and precise deep-learning algorithms for the detection and classifications of pulmonary diseases. These pictures may also be utilized to improve computer-aided diagnosis system training and validation, which will help medical personnel make better judgements and provide better treatment for patients.",

The core of the framework consists of ”Buddhi” and ”Manas.” Buddhi, a discriminative AI component, adeptly navigates sensory data, making decisions aligned with human discernment. Complementing it, ”Manas” is a generative core, capable of crafting narratives and generating creative solutions. This synergy creates an iterative loop that encapsulates human thought, enabling machines to think, visualize, and even dream. In addition to advancing AI and ML research, we conducted an experiment using a modified News Aggregator dataset from the UCI repository. The experiment focused on word prediction, and our model, infused with Indian philosophy, outperformed RNN and LSTM models over 30 epochs. This framework has the potential to revolutionize AI and create more human-like machines, ushering in a new era of AI and robotics.",

This work validates multidimensional load-pull extrapolation using generative adversarial network image completion as a method for reducing the number of measurements required to characterize a power amplifier over multiple design parameters simultaneously. Using 16 output power measurements of a transistor with different input powers and load impedances, an extrapolated three-dimensional load-pull dataset of 24,192 points can be obtained. The extrapolated data accurately predicts the optimal reflection coefficient over input power within a vector distance of about 0.1 on the Smith Chart, resulting in an achieved mean output power error of under 0.2 dB. This can speed up the high-power nonlinear power amplifier design process and can hasten real-time reconfiguration over multiple parameters.",

Solutions and methods based on artificial intelligence techniques are therefore proposed to help detect cyberattacks.

The current model of periodic patient visits with standard dialogue responses fails to adequately address the individualized needs of patients and caregivers. This lack of personalized guidance undermines treatment adherence and satisfaction. To bridge this gap, we developed a novel approach leveraging generative AI (GAI) to optimize patient-manager interactions. Focusing on prevalent chronic conditions such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and dementia, we created intelligent dialogue agents that deliver tailored, actionable nursing recommendations aligning with each case's unique circumstances. The developed methodology began by curating a corpus of 30 frequently asked questions on home care, emotional support, and social factors from online patient data across the three diseases. We employed prompt engineering to precisely define the virtual roles of nurses and physicians while implementing a “Rephrase and Respond” (RAR) protocol to enhance query comprehension and generate reliable solutions. The RAR approach solves problems by question restating, followed by contextualized recommendations from the language model. Clinical expert feedback iteratively refined the system's outputs. The evaluation result showed an average gain of 10\% in response and an increase of 5\% in readability after optimization. The optimized RAR method of large language models effectively improved the quality of nursing advice for chronic disease, aligned with patients' emotional and social needs. The RAR method in medical advisory areas, including chronic disease management and rehabilitation care, enhances the quality and practicality of nursing advice in these domains.",

The accuracy, consistency and usefulness of the AI-created material was considered. Students also reflected on their own learning from the exercise and their possible future use of AI tools. The results, from 78 students, showed that seven different generative AI tools, with a wide range of prompts, gave similar answers. The answers were judged to be useful and accurate; only two instances of the AI being widely off-topic were seen. The answers were rather vague and general; even when prompted for different topics, the AI results had much text in common.

By utilizing Deep Neural Networks to encrypt and hide the messages, it will be increasingly difficult to decrypt and track.In this study, we developed an encryption mechanism to not only conceal messages, but transforming them into images.

Using a sample of global publicly quoted companies, we confirm early studies that heterogeneity in firms' ability to scale AI is related to the early orchestration of four AI-specific assets/resources (data, technology infrastructure, AI/data talent, and organisational design). Expanding on early academic work, we uncover four distinct resource-based segments, one of which operates with the full bundle of AI resources and which we call “AI Leaders”. This segment is comprised of the so- called “AI scalers”, i.e. firms for which more than 30\% of their costs and revenues are already influenced by AI technologies, as they are able to capitalise on the stock of AI resources invested a few years earlier. We conclude that AI technologies are promising, but the translation of AI investments into significant macroeconomic effects will take time, given that only a small fringe of companies are AI leaders so far and that AI scaling depends on a compounding stock effect.

    abstract = "The swift evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI utilizing deep learning and extensive datasets, has brought substantial benefits across numerous sectors. However, this technological surge simultaneously presents intricate technical hurdles for conventional intellectual property rights protection frameworks. The unprecedented scale, speed, and unique characteristics of AI-generated content significantly strain existing manual and semi-automated IPR management systems. This paper first details the progression and functionalities of pertinent AI technologies. It then examines the pressure these capabilities exert on current IPR frameworks, highlighting technical obstacles related to verifying ownership, detecting infringement at scale, and computationally evaluating originality. We assert that overcoming these obstacles necessitates more than legal adjustments; it demands fundamentally novel engineering approaches applying AI to the IP system. Consequently, this work introduces an AI-powered engineering framework that integrates specific algorithms and applications: Natural Language Processing techniques like semantic embedding models for text analysis and comparison; Computer Vision algorithms such as perceptual hashing and deep feature extraction for image/video analysis; machine learning classifiers for filtering infringement alerts; and blockchain technology for secure timestamping and registration. This framework seeks to deliver scalable, efficient, and resilient tools for IPR registration, authentication, automated infringement surveillance, and support for originality analysis, thereby promoting technological progress while protecting creator entitlements within the dynamic digital ecosystem.",

However, concurrently fusing texts and images poses significant challenges, often struggling with the maintenance of text accuracy across languages, optimal placement, and appropriate typography. To address these challenges, we introduce the Multilingual Accurate Textual Image Customization (MATIC) framework. MATIC employs the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) concept to decompose the textual image generation process into multiple steps, leveraging diverse generative artificial intelligence, including Multimodal Large Language Model (MMLLM) and diffusion model. The framework first generates the desired text and a corresponding prompt for the diffusion model based on user input. The diffusiongenerated image is then examined to remove any undesired text. Meanwhile, the typographic elements are designed to align with the visual content. Finally, the textual image is fused with the aid of a grid coordinate system, evaluated by MMLLM, and further customized by the user through natural language. Experimental results demonstrate that MATIC can produce accurate, high-quality, multilingual textual images that meet user requirements across various domains, including digital marketing, graphic design, and educational content creation.",

    abstract = "Artificial Intelligence systems are increasingly used in critical areas like finance, healthcare, and autonomous systems, ensuring their security becomes crucial. Artificial Intelligence models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small changes to input data can cause major errors, as well as steganographic methods that hide harmful information within digital content. Recent techniques, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for steganography and adversarial training for model hardening, have shown promise but face challenges like computational inefficiency, limited generalizability, and susceptibility to evolving threats. The methodology includes five key steps: synthetic data generation, data preprocessing, multi-layered security assessments, dynamic countermeasures, and cross-domain validation. By using adversarial and steganographic data augmentation, the framework strengthens the Artificial Intelligence's ability to handle real-world threats. The approach also integrates advanced feature extraction and classification methods to improve detection accuracy. The model is tested across various domains, demonstrating its ability to secure AI systems against evolving digital threats while maintaining efficiency and adaptability.",

Because of breakthroughs in Deep Learning (DL) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) which enable the automated detection and diagnosis of brain stroke as well as intelligently assisting post-brain stroke patients for rehabilitation, is more favorable than a manual diagnosis. Many publications on automated brain stroke detection, diagnosis, and robotic management using DL and AI approaches are now being published. This review provides a study of the detection, diagnosis of brain stroke and robotic management techniques of post-brain stroke rehabilitation from six different perspectives, namely, brain stroke datasets and modalities of brain stroke data collection, pre-processing approaches, DL-based detection and diagnosis of brain stroke, Al-based intelligent post brain stroke rehabilitation assistant, and performance measures. It also examines the conclusions and the consequences of the findings. There are also three ongoing research challenges in the fields of brain stroke detection and diagnosis, as well as post-brain stroke robotic treatment. For this investigation, 130 key papers from the Scopus, PubMed and Web of Science archives were chosen after a comprehensive screening method. This study gives a comprehensive overview of brain stroke detection and post-brain stroke robotic management strategies that may be useful to the scientist’s community working in the field of automatic brain stroke detection and robotic rehabilitation management.",

In the experiment, we first use the Adam algorithm to pre-train GANs and then apply the genetic algorithm (GA) to further optimize the pre-trained model. The experimental results show that this combination method not only reduces the number of iterations required by the genetic algorithm through pre-training, thus saving the training time but also improves the performance of the training model. This shows that the use of a hybrid optimization strategy in complex network training is very effective and improves training efficiency.",

This threshold is determined by factors such as criticality, emotional-user interaction, and mass, which is the measure of the summation of related memories. Our approach reconstructs memories into reusable parameters and formulates Schemas, offering a foundation for more personalized and cost-effective human-GAI interactions.",

However, the complexity of industrial environments poses challenges to data collection, transmission, and storage, often leading to data loss and insufficiency. Synthetic data generation has become a common solution to augment datasets. Existing methods can be broadly categorized into traditional statistical techniques and deep generative approaches. Statistical methods explicitly model observed data, proving advantageous for simple, small-scale synthesis tasks. In contrast, deep generative methods implicitly model data and are capable of generating more complex datasets. Nevertheless, the data synthesized by deep generative models can be uncontrollable, with issues such as mode collapse. This paper proposes a novel data synthesis method based on the deep generative model TimeGAN, aimed at synthesizing multi-dimensional wind power time-series data. TimeGAN combines the architectures of GAN and AE (Autoencoder). The proposed method introduces a parallel structure of TCN (Temporal Convolutional Networks) and Transformer as the backbone of the generator and embedder. Additionally, Wasserstein divergence is used in place of KL (Kullback-Leibler) divergence to calculate loss, effectively mitigating mode collapse during training. Comparative experiments with baseline algorithms, including TimeGAN and diffusion models, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, this work provides new insights into predictive tasks where data collection is difficult or incomplete.",

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device that examines network traffic to confirm security, availability, and integrity.

Many academics have concentrated on constructing IDSs that leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to overcome the difficulties mentioned above. With extreme accuracy, AI algorithms can reliably identify the main distinctions among normal and anomalous data. Furthermore, AI approaches are very generalizable, allowing them to identify previously undiscovered assaults. IDS methods based on ML, DL, and meta-heuristic optimization have recently been proposed as workable alternatives for spotting intrusions throughout the network. This survey presents an IDS taxonomy that classifies and summarizes AI-based IDS research using data items as the primary dimension.

Image captioning is used in image retrieval systems to locate images of interest from a database, web, or personal devices. In recent years, investigators have been using Deep Learning to caption images with some success. However, the reported results do suffer from a number of deficiencies; namely, accuracy, lack of diversity and emotions in resultant captions. In order to address some of these deficiencies, we propose to use Generative Adversarial models to produce new and combinatorial samples.

On the other hand, the increased DoF significantly increases the complexity of design procedure, demanding for new design methods. Prior-knowledge-guided deep-learning-enabled (PK-DL) synthesis method has been then proposed to alleviate this challenge. Prior knowledge is introduced into the conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (cDCGAN) algorithm to guide and speed up the proposed synthesis method. Then, two case studies are presented. The PK-DL synthesis method is first utilized to break the phaseshift limit up to 330 degrees from 308 degrees in existing techniques and improve the 1-dB gain bandwidth of metalens antennas by 52\%. Secondly, both amplitude and phase responses of metacells are simultaneously synthesized in a single three-layered metasurface for a metalens antenna, realizing the sidelobe level suppression more than 30 dB. The latest progress demonstrates that the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to metantenna design and AI technologies provide a new opportunity in synthesizing metantennas with outstanding performances and multiple functions.",

Recently, its use in fraud detection and prevention has emerged as a viable area. Fraud, including financial fraud, identity theft, and cybercrime, costs billions of dollars each year, and standard detection systems are restricted by their inability to foresee new fraud trends. Generative AI takes a novel approach to this problem, improving fraud detection systems using anomaly detection, predictive modelling, and reinforcement learning. This paper analyses Generative AI in battling different fraud.",

On the one hand, AI techniques, e.g., NLP, enhance RE processes by automating the extraction and analysis of requirements, increasing quality, accuracy and efficiency in translating human needs into technical specifications [2]. On the other hand, RE plays a crucial role in developing AI systems themselves; it ensures that AI technologies are designed with clear, well-defined requirements that align with ethical standards and practical user needs [1]. This symbiotic relationship not only advances the capabilities of AI but also ensures that the developed systems are human-centric, reliable and trustworthy [3]. AIRE workshop aims to explore this symbiotic relation to identify complex RE problems that could benefit from applying AI techniques and addressing RE for AI challenges. The 2024 workshop edition received 21 submissions, with each submission independently reviewed by at least three program committee members. The final program consisted of nine papers (seven regular research papers and two short papers) and one lightning talk. The workshop took place on June 25th, 2024. The workshop featured a keynote by Jan-Philipp Steghofer with the title “The proof is in the pudding-Real-world use cases for GenAI for Requirements Engineers.”, and a hands-on session on generative AI in RE.

With over a hundred responses collected, the average score was 5.79 out of 10, with a median of 6, suggesting moderate success but also highlighting the difficulty many users had in discerning AI-generated content. The distribution of results showed a wide range of performance, with most participants scoring between 4 and 8 points. Some images were consistently misclassified, revealing patterns in human perception and AI-generated visual deception. These insights were used to design a workshop for high school and college students on AI in libraries, focusing on visual literacy and critical evaluation of digital media.

However, no AIGC tools are specifically tailored for industrial equipment styling.

Consequently, it makes a big effect on the quality of the simulated images. This paper presents a novel approach, end-to-end models, to simulate the desired images from the SAR image database. A series of generative adversarial networks include DCGAN, weight clipping WGAN and WGAN with gradient penalty are optimized and applied to generate typical SAR target images. Three kinds of network structures are used, include structure of DCGAN, newly proposed structure of four residual blocks networks and Resnet.

T5 and LLaMA models are used to process natural language inputs, and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) is used to manage the spatial layout of rooms. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) produces realistic floor plan images from structured data. The dataset used contains 1500 house plans based on AutoCAD, which were preprocessed by confirming dimensions, eliminating unwanted objects such as furniture, converting to JPG, and resizing to 512×512 via a padding technique. One of the significant features of the system is that it has a cost estimation module in which the Gemini API is employed for the extraction of text and dimension data from uploaded house plans. This information is then utilized to estimate the cost of construction, including items such as steel, RCC belts, rubble work, and fittings, and the results are displayed via a graphical split of costs. A Streamlit-based user interface facilitates login support for users, contractors, and dealers so that they can generate and download plans, see estimates of costs, and allocate work based on reviews. The suggested solution cuts down substantially the time and expense involved in conventional architectural processes, providing a cost-effective, scalable platform for custom home design.",

We propose an innovative algorithm that integrates the benefits of variational autoencoders (VAE) and generative adversarial networks (Gans) to enable more efficient and flexible poster design generation. As a powerful generative model, variational autoencoders can generate new samples by learning potential representations of data. The generative adversarial network, with its excellent generative ability and adversarial training mechanism, has made remarkable achievements in the field of image generation. By integrating the two, we have built an intelligent system capable of capturing complex features of poster designs and producing diverse, high-quality posters. In the algorithm implementation, we use variational autoencoder to encode the poster design data and extract the potential feature representation. These features are then fed into a generator in the generative adversarial network to generate a new poster design through adversarial training. At the same time, we designed an efficient loss function to balance the diversity and authenticity of the generated posters. The experimental results show that the algorithm has excellent performance in poster design generation. It can not only generate creative and personalized posters, but also customize the design according to user needs. In addition, the algorithm also shows good generalization ability when dealing with different styles and themes of poster design. In the future, we will continue to optimize algorithms, explore more application scenarios, and promote the deep integration of computer artificial intelligence and visual communication design.",

    abstract = "This study proposes an algorithm for detecting suspicious behaviors in large payment flows based on deep generative models. By combining Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE), the algorithm is designed to detect abnormal behaviors in financial transactions. First, the GAN is used to generate simulated data that approximates normal payment flows. The discriminator identifies anomalous patterns in transactions, enabling the detection of potential fraud and money laundering behaviors. Second, a VAE is introduced to model the latent distribution of payment flows, ensuring that the generated data more closely resembles real transaction features, thus improving the model’s detection accuracy. The method optimizes the generative capabilities of both GAN and VAE, ensuring that the model can effectively capture suspicious behaviors even in sparse data conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional machine learning algorithms and other deep learning models across various evaluation metrics, especially in detecting rare fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, this study provides a detailed comparison of performance in recognizing different transaction patterns (such as normal, money laundering, and fraud) in large payment flows, validating the advantages of generative models in handling complex financial data.",

With the continuous and in-depth research on intelligent mobile networks, green edge intelligence would be a new paradigm of MEC. AI is playing a more important role in the mobile edge computing. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of recent work on AI and MEC. Specially, we first review the various AI techniques. We then propose a novel concept of green edge intelligence.

The communication party and the adversary fight against each other to continuously improve their own capabilities to achieve a state of secure communication. However, this model can only have a better communication effect under the 16 bits communication length, and cannot adapt to the length of modern encrypted communication. Combine the neural network structure in DCGAN to optimize the neural network of the original model, and at the same time increase the batch normalization process, and optimize the loss function in the original model. Experiments show that under the condition of the maximum 2048-bit communication length, the decryption success rate of communication reaches about 0.97, while ensuring that the adversary’s guess error rate is about 0.95, and the training speed is greatly increased to keep it below 5000 steps, ensuring safety and efficiency Communication.",

There are over 10 million new cases of tuberculosis each year. Machine and deep learning models are trained to recognize specific pixels inside a medical image for the purposes of classification and disease progression tracking, however the decision-making mechanism of these models is hidden from the user. In this context, Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) refers to strategies that allow humans to understand the results of AI algorithms. Recently, a variety of XAI methods for classification and generative have been proposed; however, these methods only use a subset of most discriminative power characteristics, resulting in false positives. This article proposes CycleGAN-based multi-functional generative adversarial networks to efficiently solve these challenges. Proposed model is trained in weakly supervised context to identify and visualize the disease effects and finally generate binary mask in data augmentation context. The model takes a Chest radiography (CXR) as input, creates a change map showing the disease's effect at a specific spot, and then uses this map to create a binary mask of original image. Results on publicly available TB dataset, TBX11K, confirm that the proposed model produces highly accurate result.",

    abstract = {Decentralized governance is going through radical changes due to the innovative use of blockchain which allows decisions to be made in a transparent, secure and more im- portantly, immutable way, without the authority of a single individual or party. Thus, the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) in blockchain governing systems complicates such thing as transparency and trust, especially in the case of deep AI systems. But more on this later – this is where Explainable AI or XAI comes into the picture. XAI methods enable understanding of the reasons behind the choices made by AI models and solves the "black box" problem that is predominant in machine learn- ing. When applied to decentralised governance, XAI provides clarifications of AI’s decision making in such areas as voting, resource distribution and the enactment of smart contracts. This way, the stakeholders are confident that the decision-making is fair and impartial and this is made possible by the use of XAI. This paper aims to find out more about the applicability of XAI concept in blockchain –based governance systems in terms of bias and fairness in automated decisions and explanation of the decisions made. The reasons why interpretability plays the crucial role in decentralized systems are explained with the help of the comparison between the classical artificial intelligence and the Xin Intelligent. The study also looks at various use cases such as, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), and voting systems implemented on blockchain platforms and how XAI can enhance the performance of the governance systems. As this study shows, XAI is vital in building trust, improving responsibility, and guaranteeing balanced majorities in decentralized blockchain governance structures.},

The newly emerging field employs a variety of techniques and architectures to produce different kinds of outputs, ranging from text and images to music and full synthetic environments. One of the most popular paradigms of such field is the family of generative models, and, recently, the subfamily of large language models (LLMs). Thus, generative AI, including LLMs, is based on the conception of probability distribution. This is when technology feds many datasets and learns the patterns and laws that hide under that data, enabling the AI to write effectively. LLMs have been used to schedule and seed texts naturally across various domains, from training transformer-like models, to code prototyping, writing, and journal narration. Thus, to resolve the challenges associated with it, an integrated nature of modeling with the training techniques is evolved, which eventually follows all the rules, regulations, as well as guidelines that help in successful implementation of generative models and LLMs.",

However, the effectiveness of AI models is hindered due to high costs, privacy concerns, and challenges in acquiring large annotated datasets. Artificial data generation techniques, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and hybrid models like Disc-VAE, have gained prominence in dealing with these barriers. These techniques aim to augment datasets while preserving the complicated capabilities inherent to medical images. This paper compares the efficacy of Vector Quantized VAE with GAN and Disc-VAE using metrics Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). The Vector Quantized VAE outperforms GAN and Disc-VAE in terms of SSIM and PSNR metrics. The findings spotlight the transformative capability of synthetic information augmentation for the medical system by enabling early and accurate disease diagnosis.

    abstract = "Students’ decision-making related to attending college for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees and retaining them within those fields continue to be of focus, especially when considering the national goal of satisfying industry, private, and public sector workforce needs. This is particularly important when considering growing national security concerns and ongoing high cybersecurity and climate change workforce demands. However, despite concerted efforts, low enrollment and student attrition continue to be a challenge, even more so since the onset of the global pandemic. Simultaneously, the utilization of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has seen a sharp increase since 2022 by various stakeholders, most notably college students. Additionally, faculty are encouraged by their higher education institutions to incorporate these tools within classrooms for several reasons, including demands from industry for students to gain knowledge and experience with generative AI tools. Given the importance of understanding the ongoing issue of STEM degree attrition and the increasing utilization of generative AI, this research study explored these two areas using ChatGPT, one of the world's most utilized generative AI language models, within the process. The first research question (RQ\#l) is: What is the top reason why students do notfinish college? The response provided solely emphasized finances and/or financial constraints. Based on that answer, the second research question (RQ \#2) was: Is getting a college degree worth the cost? RQ \#2 was explored to allow a deeper understanding of the initial research question from a different angle. Both questions were analyzed through the lens of two theoretical frameworks, the human capital theory and the principal-agent theory, and results were compared to the literature as a form of research validation. This research study is essential as there is an ongoing increase in the utilization of generative AI in homes, K-12 institutions, and higher education for everyday knowledge, formal and informal education. When considering that soon-to-be and current college students may be using these generative AI tools to make decisions related to pursuing and/or retaining their educational status, it is essential to explore how generative AI system outputs align with what has been researched and documented in the literature. Therefore, this research study explored the application of ChatGPT and the system's responses to research questions as a form of document analysis and analyzed those results using triangulation as a form of validation. The analysis and results of this study contributed directly to the recommendations and feedback to the owners of ChatGPT - OpenAI. Additionally, the results highlighted a need for increased focus on AI ethics related to data input, data output, access to the system, and who has a seat at the table as the company recommends, approves, and implements changes.

    abstract = "A myriad of recent literary works have leveraged generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate unseen evasion samples. The purpose is to annex the generated data with the original train set for adversarial training to improve the detection performance of machine learning (ML) classifiers. The quality of generated adversarial samples relies on the adequacy of training data samples. However, in low data regimes like medical diagnostic imaging and cybersecurity, the anomaly samples are scarce in number. This paper proposes a novel GAN design called evasion generative adversarial network (EVAGAN) that is more suitable for low data regime problems that use oversampling for detection improvement of ML classifiers. EVAGAN not only can generate evasion samples but its discriminator can act as an evasion-aware classifier. We have considered auxiliary classifier GAN (ACGAN) as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of EVAGAN on cybersecurity (ISCX-2014, CIC-2017, and CIC2018) botnet and computer vision (MNIST) datasets. We demonstrate that EVAGAN outperforms ACGAN for unbalanced datasets with respect to detection performance, training stability, and time complexity. EVAGAN's generator quickly learns to generate the low sample class and hardens its discriminator simultaneously. In contrast to ML classifiers that require security hardening after being adversarially trained by GAN-generated data, EVAGAN renders it needless. The experimental analysis proves that EVAGAN is an efficient evasion hardened model for low data regimes for the selected cybersecurity and computer vision datasets.",

    abstract = "In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), native generative AI (GenAI) has become prominent in generating intelligent cyber-attacks in a smart grid environment by imitating operational parameters and metrics. As a result, it is imperative to understand the attack generation capabilities of native GenAI models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Autoencoders in a smart grid environment. This research aims to explore the potential of GenAI models to accurately imitate and analyze the behavior of cyberattacks within a smart grid environment. The goal is to understand the risks posed by these intelligent attacks while developing strategies to protect against disruptive Distributed Energy Resources (DER) events, such as incorrect load shifting, imbalanced demand supply, and unstable price forecasting. First, this work leverages two customized native GenAI models, namely GAN and Autoencoder, to synthesize DERs control message parameters such as nominal power consumption, price elasticity coefficients, and communication data packets, among others, to introduce highly unpredictable new intelligent attack vectors. Second, this research proposes and develops a new Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) framework by creating correlation dependency nodes among DER control message parameters to understand the risks of intelligent attack vectors better while monitoring and mitigating their impact on smart grid operations. In particular, by leveraging the customized BBN, the system can observe and analyze the uncertain behaviors in DER operations that GenAI introduces, and the proposed framework can help mitigate grid vulnerabilities by understanding the poisonous parameters through mutual information. Finally, the experiment results show that the Autoencoder outperformed GAN in reproducing intelligent attacks with an MSE about 98.984\% lower than that of GANs. Additionally, BBN can explain prominent parameters of the intelligent attacks’ by quantifying dependencies through mutual information.",

As the discussion around Artificial Superintelligence underscores the importance of continual dialogue between man and its ability to control technology, it also raises the problem of designing intelligent interactive and collaborative tools and systems to allow this dialogue. Historically, the term “AI” was used from 1950 to 1975, then fell out of favor during the” AI winter” from 1975 to 1995, and was narrowed to ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence). As a result, terms like “Machine Learning,” “Natural language Processing,” and “Data Science” were frequently mislabelled as AI. Today, AI has allowed clinicians to rely heavily on ML which is highly integrated with coding, billing, medical records, scheduling, contracting, medication ordering, and administrative functions. AI is now a thriving industry with massive capital investments and once again is on the verge of a great revolution. There are compelling reasons to investigate artificial super intelligence. This type of AI is capable of surpassing human intellect by expressing cognitive skills and developing its own mental capabilities. ASI is a highly sophisticated, and intelligent type of AI that goes beyond normal intellectual capacity. This paper will discuss the societal impact and the current academic impact of ASI. Finally, this study would attempt to utilize the Markov Decision Model of Machine Learning to predict the trajectory of ASI in the very near future.",

    abstract = "Accurate and trust are crucial for ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence (AI) markets. One of the challenges is data leakage, which is frequently overlooked but possesses highly consequential implications. Federated learning (FL) is recognised as a new era of secure AI systems. The market for FL is estimated to reach USD 266.77 million by 2030 according to Polaris Market Research (1). This paper focuses on FL-based approaches for improving AI safety and examines the significance of Deep learning (DL) and its privacy implications. This has been achieved through six models: Federated Convolutional Neural Network (F-CNN), Federated averaging CNN (FA-CNN), Federated Adam (FA), Malicious Generative adversarial network (MGAN), Federated M-GAN (FMGAN) and Conditional GAN (CGAN). The authors analysed MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets and conducted extensive numerical evaluations to confirm improved user privacy in federated learning for AI models. A case study with fast convergence speed and excellent asymptotic test accuracy was designed to outline White-box attacks on MGAN, FMGAN, and CGAN models. The study also implemented active inference attacks on deep neural networks without sharing raw data through FL. We created 256 synthetic images specifically to test the effectiveness of the original classifier. These counterfeit visuals effectively deceived the classifier, appearing as legitimate representations of true class labels. Trimming shared parameters was ineffective in preventing the attack, revealing limitations in collaborative learning. The generator shows the least loss of 0.0104 encountered of all models in the study. Our Generator is also the fastest after the FMGAN model. FMGAN performs best with maximum accuracy (0.9613) followed by CGAN (0.9208), MGAN (0.9163), FA (0.5148), FCNN (0.4376) and FACNN (0.4285). It also demonstrated high efficiency by successfully attacking in a short timeframe of 0.7459 milliseconds. The Federated approach led by Adam exhibited the longest processing time, at approximately 10.52 minutes. The case study illustrates the risks of surveillance and manipulation by attackers, who pressured participants to disclose confidential information. It also aimed to increase flexibility and robustness. Our work is accessible to diverse audiences, facilitating the adoption and practical applications of deep learning methods for privacy protection by major corporations.",

However, very little progress has been made to address them.

With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), there is a need for AI literacy that goes beyond the traditional AI education curriculum. AI literacy has been conceptualized in various ways, including public literacy, competency building for designers, conceptual understanding of AI concepts, and domain-specific upskilling. Most of these conceptualizations were established before the public release of Generative AI (Gen-AI) tools such as ChatGPT. AI education has focused on the principles and applications of AI through a technical lens that emphasizes the mastery of AI principles, the mathematical foundations underlying these technologies, and the programming and mathematical skills necessary to implement AI solutions. The non-technical component of AI literacy has often been limited to social and ethical implications, privacy and security issues, or the experience of interacting with AI. In AI Literacy for all, we emphasize a balanced curriculum that includes technical as well as non-technical learning outcomes to enable a conceptual understanding and critical evaluation of AI technologies in an interdisciplinary socio-technical context. The paper presents four pillars of AI literacy: understanding the scope and technical dimensions of AI, learning how to interact with Gen-AI in an informed and responsible way, the socio-technical issues of ethical and responsible AI, and the social and future implications of AI. While it is important to include all learning outcomes for AI education in a Computer Science major, the learning outcomes can be adjusted for other learning contexts, including, non-CS majors, high school summer camps, the adult workforce, and the public. This paper advocates for a shift in AI literacy education to offer a more interdisciplinary socio-technical approach as a pathway to broaden participation in AI. This approach not only broadens students' perspectives but also prepares them to think critically about integrating AI into their future professional and personal lives.",

[Objectives]: Given the dramatic boom of modern AI, this research aims to unearth the evolution pattern along the recent three AI waves (namely predictive AI, generative AI and agentic AI), and accordingly to guide AI research and development to focus on the most promising directions. [Method]: We employed analogical reasoning as the research method and referred to the existing software architectural styles to inspire our understanding of the architectural evolution of modern AI technologies. [Results]: We see a service-oriented trend in modern AI's working mechanisms, and the offering of AI power seems to be transiting from a heavyweight and monolithic paradigm to an organisational and collaborative paradigm with more and more specific separation of concerns. Following this service-oriented evolution trend, we borrow software architecture lessons and foresee opportunities to grow the current AI wave to a further height, e.g., standardising AI agent-friendly APIs and developing serverless AI agents.

From these data, valuable results are being created through data analysis technologies. Among them, artificial intelligence (AI) has shown remarkable performances in various fields and is emerging as an innovative technology. In particular, machine learning and deep learning models are evolving rapidly and are being widely deployed in practical applications. Meanwhile, behind the widespread use of these models, privacy concerns have been continuously raised. In addition, as substantial privacy invasion attacks against machine learning and deep learning models have been proposed, the importance of research on privacy-preserving AI is being emphasized. Accordingly, in the field of differential privacy, which has become a de facto standard for preserving privacy, various mechanisms have been proposed to preserve the privacy of AI models. However, it is unclear how to calibrate appropriate privacy parameters, taking into account the trade-off between a model’s utility and data privacy. Moreover, there is a lack of research that analyzes the relationship between the degree of differential privacy guarantee and privacy invasion attacks. In this paper, we investigate the resistance of differentially private AI models to substantial privacy invasion attacks according to the degree of privacy guarantee, and analyze how privacy parameters should be set to prevent the attacks while preserving the utility of the models. Specifically, we focus on generative adversarial networks (GAN), which is one of the most sophisticated AI models, and on the membership inference attack, which is the most fundamental privacy invasion attack. In the experimental evaluation, by quantifying the effectiveness of the attack based on the degree of privacy guarantee, we show that differential privacy can simultaneously preserve data privacy and the utility of models with moderate privacy budgets.",

The method is based on the framework of conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN), and we improved the CGAN framework for ECG denoising. The proposed framework consists of two networks: a generator that is composed of the optimized convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) and a discriminator that is composed of four convolution layers and one full connection layer. As the convolutional layers of CAE can preserve spatial locality and the neighborhood relations in the latent higher-level feature representations of ECG signal, and the skip connection facilitates the gradient propagation in the denoising training process, the trained denoising model has good performance and generalization ability. The extensive experimental results on MIT-BIH databases show that for single noise and mixed noises, the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of denoised ECG signal is above 39 dB, and it is better than that of the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the denoised classification results of four cardiac diseases show that the average accuracy increased above 32$\\%$ under multiple noises under SNR=0 dB. So, the proposed method can remove noise effectively as well as keep the details of the features of ECG signals.",

LSN-GAN showed improved results, achieving higher Inception Scores and lower FID values compared to models like SN-GAN and GN-GAN, indicating better image generation capabilities.

By leveraging advanced AI models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), the model generates synthetic data that mimics these rare occurrences. The GAN generates synthetic data that enriches the training set and improves prediction accuracy. The VAE captures the complex non-linear relationships between input features and output. The combination of both models gives us a robust framework for yield prediction. Experimental results shows that the GAN dataset gives 14\% improvement over baseline models. VAE model gives 13\% improvement on its own, showing its ability to handle the variability and complexity of agricultural data. This dual model approach is a big leap in agricultural analytics and will enable more robust and adaptive farming in the face of climate change.",

By integrating epistemic network analysis (ENA), sequential analysis, and retrospective interviews, this study analysed the interactions of 16 junior secondary students with five types of GenAI feedback. The results revealed that high self-efficacy learners develop metacognitive networks centred on evaluating and dynamically cycling between feedback types to inform future learning. In contrast, low self-efficacy learners displayed a metacognitive strategy network dominated by planning and linear behavioural sequences that prioritise immediate task completion. The findings advocate for self-efficacy-driven GenAI feedback systems that dynamically tailor metacognitive scaffolding to catalyse personalised self-regulated learning.",

The interpretation of SAR images encounters various hurdles, with one of the primary obstacles being the data itself, which includes issues related to both the quantity and quality of the data. The challenges can be addressed using generative AI technologies. Generative AI, often known as GenAI, is a very advanced and powerful technology in the field of artificial intelligence that has gained significant attention. The advancement has created possibilities for the creation of texts, photorealistic pictures, videos, and material in various modalities. This paper aims to comprehensively investigate the intersection of GenAI and SAR. First, we illustrate the common data generation-based applications in SAR field and compare them with computer vision tasks, analyzing the similarity, difference, and general challenges of them. Then, an overview of the latest GenAI models is systematically reviewed, including various basic models and their variations targeting the general challenges. Additionally, the corresponding applications in SAR domain are also included. Specifically, we propose to summarize the physical model based simulation approaches for SAR, and analyze the hybrid modeling methods that combine the GenAI and interpretable models. The evaluation methods that have been or could be applied to SAR, are also explored. Finally, the potential challenges and future prospects are discussed.

Firstly, the twenty-six degree-of-freedom dynamic model is established to realize the virtual entity of two-stage gearbox. The initial parameters of dynamic model are determined by the prior knowledge based on the fault mechanism of gear. Then, the improved generative adversarial network is designed to achieve the interaction of virtual entity and physical entity. The measured signal from the physical entity is used to train the proposed model for minimizing the difference of simulation signal from the dynamic model. The loss of proposed model is introduced by combining the physics knowledge of gear dynamic mechanism and observations from the sensor. Finally, the proposed method is applied to simulate the vibration signal of gear fault under different conditions that is consistent with the measured signal, which can be applied for the fault diagnosis of gear. The two-stage gearbox fault experiments with missing sample are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",

    abstract = "A major study topic, particularly in machine learning and artificial intelligence, has resulted from the prediction of traffic congestion in recent years (AI). During the last few decade, this study field has greatly increased due to the emergence of huge data from stationary sensor or probe vehicle data. Congestion forecasting requires analysing a wide range of traffic variables, especially for short-term planning. Predictions of future traffic congestion are based mostly on analyses of past patterns. Using traffic data like taxi trip records, urban traffic statistics, and junction counts, we propose a new method for calculating traffic flows. The suggested method makes use of CGAN and GCN, and we enhanced Unet to realise a key component of the generator. The interaction between junctions with surveillance and intersections without monitoring is then captured using floating taxis that are spread out over the whole city. The CGAN architecture may modify the weights and improve the inference capability to provide an accurate traffic status under the present circumstances. The results of the experiment demonstrate that our technique is more accurate at estimating traffic volume than other methods.",

To address these issues, this paper introduces an objective method for determining intelligence levels using the ELO rating algorithm and constructs an intelligence level evaluation model based on the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to account for missing evaluation indicators. The model takes evaluation indicators as input and ELO scores as output, providing an objective reflection of the intelligence capabilities of unmanned clusters. Using an airground collaborative encirclement task as an example, the model is trained to evaluate the intelligence levels of unmanned clusters objectively. Simulation results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in quantifying intelligence levels objectively and its applicability to a wide range of unmanned clusters.",

    abstract = "The recent development of generative art, a typical category of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC), is essentially beneficial for social good, which can help amateurs to create artwork and improve experts’ efficiency. However, some artists are opposed to generative art technologies due to the copyright infringement and influence of the artists’ way of earning a living, which makes the artists protest against generative art technologies, causing a lose–lose situation. Adversarial attacks against generative model training are potential solutions to address this issue, while the lose–lose situation cannot be improved. To build a win–win situation, a feasible method is to incentivize the artists to actively contribute their artworks to generative model training without influencing their living or infringing copyright, such as data crowdsourcing, but traditional data crowdsourcing methods cannot well fit the generative art area. Therefore, this article builds a blockchain-based trading system for generative model training data collection and generated artwork circulation. Specifically, this article formulates a social welfare maximization problem based on the reverse auction and designs a corresponding incentive mechanism. The conducted theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed incentive mechanism toward a win–win situation for generative art model trainers and artists.",

Gradually this disease results in memory loss, poor thinking capacity, and overall cognitive decline. Nevertheless, various traditional works recommend that the pathological variations present in the brain happen decades prior to the initial clinical signs appearing. The implementation of cost-effective and noninvasive approaches to identify AD is significant for its timely mitigation as well as prevention. Therefore, in this article, an advanced generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided AD detection approach is designed using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which are helpful for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression very effectively. The EEG signals required for the identification of AD are collected from benchmark sources and are applied as the input to the ShortTerm Fourier Transform (STFT) for spectrogram image conversion. The AD detection is done using the proposed Attention-based Generative Adversarial Network (A-GAN), which produces the most desirable detection outcomes by classifying the input STFT images. The classification results are compared with the baseline AD detection approaches to validate the performance of the designed technique using various measures. The developed model supports earlier detection and provides highly more effective treatment interventions.",

In particular, deep neural networks have shown unmatched capabilities for visual recognition tasks like classifying, localizing and segmenting objects of interest in complex scenes. A key advancement that has enabled the success of these techniques is the development of convolutional neural network (CNN) for moving object detection (MOD). Various architectures based on CNN can identify multiple objects in an image and draw bounding boxes around them. These networks can be trained on large annotated datasets to learn rich visual features automatically, eliminating the need for hand\&\#x2010;coded feature extraction. Pre\&\#x2010;trained networks can also be fine\&\#x2010;tuned for specific use cases involving detection of relevant objects like cars, humans and animals. This object detection capability provides the foundation for tracking objects across multiple frames in a video. AI, ML, and deep learning (DL) consistently outperform classical computer vision techniques for tasks like simultaneous object detection, semantic segmentation, anomaly detection in videos and predicting object trajectories over time. With innovations in neural network architectures, unsupervised and semi\&\#x2010;supervised learning, and leveraging motion and scene understanding beyond just appearances, the performance on these tasks continues to improve.

To be specific, large GenAI models are envisioned to open up a new era of autonomous wireless networks, in which multi-modal GenAI models trained over various Telecom data, can be fine-tuned to perform several downstream tasks, eliminating the need for building and training dedicated AI models for each specific task, and paving the way for the realization of artificial general intelligence (AGI)-empowered wireless networks.

In particular, we first highlight the applications of large GenAI models in future wireless networks, defining potential use-cases and revealing insights on the associated theoretical and practical challenges. Furthermore, we unveil how 6G can open up new opportunities through connecting multiple on-device large GenAI models, and hence, pave the way to the collective intelligence paradigm.

While analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits have significantly advanced, the future of 5G and 6G transceiver design could be accelerated by including artificial intelligence. In this combination, analog integrated circuit design and operation would harness machine learning to identify, characterize, and act upon variations and anomalies in system performance. Focusing on 5G and 6G, this paper investigates solutions for a unified intelligent integrated transceiver: a conceptual combination of a traditional analog subsystem, a supporting digital subsystem that enables artificial intelligence, and dedicated feedback circuitry or sensors that monitor performance, efficiency, or reliability. Active and passive components and propagation channels are reviewed based on their merits of introducing intelligence. Holistically and for broader applicability, the paper conceptualizes and coins the notion of an “intelligent integrated system (IIS)”, which brings forward a novel unified vision and approach toward context-aware subsystems that dynamically interact with ambient and varying operating conditions.

So the trapdoor in a public key encryption mechanism turns out to be a type of limited resource. In this paper, we generalize the methodology of adversarial learning model in artificial intelligence and introduce a novel way to conveniently obtain sub-optimal and computationally hard trapdoors based on the automatic information theoretic search technique. The basic routine is constructing a generative architecture to search and discover a probabilistic reversible generator which can correctly encoding and decoding any input messages. The architecture includes a trapdoor generator built on a variational autoencoder (VAE) responsible for searching the appropriate trapdoors satisfying a maximum of entropy, a random message generator yielding random noise, and a dynamic classifier taking the results of the two generator. The evaluation of our construction shows the architecture satisfying basic indistinguishability of outputs under chosen-plaintext attack model (CPA) and high efficiency in generating cheap trapdoors.",

The models were trained using the first dataset, which included power ranges below 12.5W. Subsequently, the second dataset, with power ranges above 12.5W, was used to test the pre-trained models’ extrapolation abilities.

As edge robots become increasingly integrated into daily life and critical infrastructure, the complexity and connectivity of these systems introduce formidable challenges in ensuring security, resilience, and safety. GenAI advances from mere data interpretation to autonomously generating new data, proving critical in complex, context-aware environments like edge robotics. Our survey delves into the impact of GenAI technologies—including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Transformer-based models, and Large Language Models (LLMs)—on cybersecurity, decision-making, and the development of resilient architectures. We categorize existing research to highlight how these technologies address operational challenges and innovate predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and adaptive threat response. Our comprehensive analysis distinguishes this work from existing reviews by mapping out the applications, challenges, and technological advancements of GenAI and their impact on creating secure frameworks for autonomous systems.

    abstract = "Shared parking optimizes available parking spaces by allowing private owners like in residential areas such as condominiums, hotels, apartments and private garage, to rent out their parking spots during times when they are unoccupied1. The concept of shared parking allows drivers – residents and visitors - avoid the long search for an unoccupied parking space while also allowing the space owners to earn passive income by renting out their owned spots during times when they’re not using them. This allows them to monetize an underutilized asset and promotes sharing economy strategy. Especially in big cities like in Metro Manila, motorists spent 24 minutes every day searching for parking on average2, where 37\% of the cars in congested traffic were cruising for parking for an average of 20 minutes. This shared parking platform aims to mitigate the challenge of long search for an unoccupied residential parking space, limited parking facilities, and time-consuming property approval and payment process, providing drivers with more accessible and affordable options while reducing the daily time spent searching for parking. This platform will enable residential parking owners to rent out their parking spaces to residents/drivers who are in need of a convenient and well-priced parking space for a couple of hours, days or longer period. This case study aims to explore the development and implementation of this platform – both web and mobile – that leverages Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and user-centric design to revolutionize the parking experience, fostering a more sustainable and streamlined approach to sharing economy.

Although looking appealing to human eyes, training a model on purely synthetic images for downstream image processing tasks like image classification often results in an undesired performance drop compared to training on real data. Previous works have demonstrated that enhancing a real dataset with synthetic images from DGMs can be beneficial. However, the improvements were subjected to certain circumstances and yet were not comparable to adding the same number of real images. In this work, we propose a new taxonomy to describe factors contributing to this commonly observed phenomenon and investigate it on the popular CIFAR-10 dataset. We hypothesize that the Content Gap accounts for a large portion of the performance drop when using synthetic images from DGM and propose strategies to better utilize them in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets showcase that our method outperforms baselines on downstream classification tasks both in case of training on synthetic only (Synthetic-to-Real) and training on a mix of real and synthetic data (Data Augmentation), particularly in the data-scarce scenario.",

    abstract = "Personalized learning has significantly enhanced teaching practice through its development to cater to varied learning needs and in its full utilization of learner engagement. Traditional practice, in contrast, is limited by fixed content, minimum learner flexibility, and minimal immediate feedback. Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) introduces a revolution through self-generated adaptive learning material such as customized tests, interactive simulations, and adaptive lesson plans. This article presents a systematic review on the use of Generative AI in education, synthesizing what has been published on its contributions to learning achievement based on empirical studies. Studies conducted by AI-powered platforms like Khan Academy's AI tutor and Duolingo's adaptive questions indicate a 26-38\% boost in student engagement, a 34\% boost in learning retention, and a 40\% decrease in teacher workloads. Additionally, current evidence shows that adaptive learning models implemented using AI cut dropout rates by 22\% and improved evaluation accuracy through live automated feedback. Despite these advantages, data confidentiality, algorithm bias, and material reliability concerns continue to exist. This paper fills this gap through the discussion of ethical AI platforms, the usage of open-sourced datasets in minimizing bias, and Explainable AI (XAI) as a means for transparency. Moreover, it explores hybrid AI-human models of education, scalability of AI-powered education in developing regions, and policy recommendations for affordable education. By integrating existing research, this paper also contributes to the body of knowledge on AI-facilitated personalized learning and its implications for learning in the future.",

This study constructed a GAN-based generative model for F0 contours that can stably generate more-various F0 contours that fit the statistical characteristics of the training data.

In older greenhouses, the different environmental factors are set manually, resulting in unfavorable climate conditions due to over- and undershoots of the factors. Optimizing environmental conditions, closed-loop control systems (CLCS) are used to reduce the susceptibility to over- and undershoots as well as to disturbance variables. The greenhouse actuators respond to various input values bringing changes to the environmental parameters. For controlling the actuators, artificial intelligence (AI) offers the potential to control the environmental parameters more accurately than a simple CLCS. With the help of predicting the influence of actuators regarding the greenhouse climate, AI-based climate systems might outperform CLCS systems and human experts.

AI is no longer limited to advanced applications; it is embedded in applications and tools we use daily to streamline tasks and solve problems. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, are designed to help users make decisions, produce recommendations, and provide more personalized solutions to user inquiries. The immense reach these systems have had in such a short period has significantly impacted education, work, and interpersonal interactions. AI systems are only becoming more common, and it is imperative that developers work to address bias within them to promote fair use for all, not only the neurotypical. Research investigating the bias harbored by LLM platforms is particularly limited when it comes to addressing bias against individuals with autism. We applied inductive thematic analysis, followed by deductive thematic analysis, to analyze 34 scientific research papers gathered from two major academic databases: ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore. This method helped us learn more about the current empirical understanding of LLM bias as it relates to the context of autism. We found that bias within LLMs has the potential to harm individuals with autism who are looking for answers to problems for which LLMs have been postulated as a solution. LLMs also have the potential to reinforce negative stereotypes, leading users with autism who already face bias in daily life to continually struggle when faced with this new technological frontier.",

This study proposes an unsupervised model based on the deep convolutional generative adversarial network that performs anomaly detection on brain MRIs to diagnose AD. The model is able to yield an AUROC of 0.7951, a precision of 0.8228, a recall of 0.7386, and an accuracy of 74.44\%.",

    abstract = "Generative adversarial network (GAN) has been extensively applied in many fields since it was first proposed in 2014. There have been ongoing attempts at improving the model and developing its extensions. The basic idea behind GAN stems from the two-player zero-sum game. Composed of a generator and a discriminator, GAN is trained through a “battle” between the two networks, where the generator tries to fool the discriminator. In contrast, the discriminator tries not to be deceived. The purpose is to estimate the potential distribution of data samples and generate new data samples. GAN is currently being studied in computer vision, language processing, and information security and is still far from reaching its potential. Since there are limited existing resources on GAN reviews, this paper provides a comprehensive review of a few of the most important GAN variants. We divided the variants into three categories: foundation, extension, and advanced, gave an overview of each architecture, and analyzed their advantages and disadvantages. We also summarized some of the most popular applications of GAN, and finally, we brought up the problems of GAN-based architectures that have yet to be solved and pointed out the future direction of GAN research and development.",

In this paper, we first propose a spatial-spectral conditional generative adversarial networks (scGANs) method to solve this problem, based on the following assumptions: the unmixing process from pixels to abundance can be viewed as a transformation of two modalities with an intrinsic specific relationship. The method learns the manifold structure of the hyperspectral data using an adversarial strategy, inputting pixels blocks with spatial information to generate the abundance of the central pixels. Then, we proposed superpixel segmentation and random splitting method to synthesize data with spatial structure. Finally, the proposed scGANs method is evaluated using synthetic data and real hyperspectral data, and compared to several state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method outperforms all the comparison methods in the experiments.",

Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction, also known as prognostics, is critically significant for the sustainability of ICPS. The prognostics involve utilizing process monitoring devices within ICPS to acquire real-time operational data. Based on the trends observed in the monitored data, the analysis predicts when potential system failures may occur. Accurate prognostics allow real-time monitoring of the system's health status, which enables early warning of possible faults and system reliability. The primary objective of this paper is to provide readers with a timely survey and review that reveals the current research status, development trends, and common challenges in the prognostics domain within ICPS. From the perspective of artificial intelligence (AI), the paper comprehensively reviews predictive approaches based on stochastic process, machine learning, and their hybrid applications. Through a comprehensive comparison of existing approaches, the paper delves into the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches. Furthermore, facing some cutting-edge issues in existing RUL prediction approaches for ICPS, this paper analyzes some pioneering investigations that have achieved great results.

The first application implements the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (C-GAN) investigated on generalized state vectors extracted from spectrum representation samples to study the dynamic behaviour of the wideband signal. While the second application is based on learning a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model from a generalized state vector which contains sub-bands information extracted from the radio spectrum. Results show that both of the proposed methods are capable of detecting abnormal signals in the spectrum and pave the road towards Self-Aware radio.",

These diseases occur when abnormal cells proliferate uncontrollably, exceeding their usual boundaries to invade adjacent body structures and potentially disseminate to distant organs. It stands as a noteworthy global health concern, prompting ongoing research aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of its root causes, devising more effective treatments and refining early detection methods. Advancements in fields like genomics, immunology and artificial intelligence are contributing to our comprehension of cancer and the creation of innovative approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Early detection and improvements in cancer therapy have intensified survival rates for many cancer types, yet it continues to position a substantial health challenge worldwide. Deep learning has emerged as an effective tool in the cancer diagnosis, promising enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and speed in various aspects of cancer assessment. Artificial intelligence algorithms that use the deep learning method are effective at analyzing medical imaging like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), X-radiation images, Computerized Tomography (CT) scans, and to identify and classify malignant anomalies. Moreover, deep learning can be connected to extract quantitative features from medical images, a discipline known as radiomics, which yields valuable insights for characterizing tumors and forecasting their prognosis. Extending the possibility, innovative technologies like Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) assumes a pivotal role in the domain of cancer diagnosis by producing synthetic data, images, or simulations that lend invaluable support to various features of cancer detection and analysis. These technologies find application across the spectrum of cancer related tasks, spanning detection, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment optimization, drug discovery and patient care.

In recent years, advancements in AI techniques have led to the exploration of innovative approaches for enhancing anomaly detection capabilities. This study introduces a novel methodology leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for anomaly detection in network traffic data, contributing to the advancement of AI cybersecurity. The proposed approach integrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature selection, allowing for the extraction of essential network traffic patterns while reducing dimensionality. Subsequently, GANs are employed to learn the underlying distribution of normal network traffic and generate synthetic samples for anomaly detection. This framework offers a holistic solution that combines the strengths of feature selection and generative modeling to effectively discern anomalous activities from normal network behaviors. The methodology is evaluated using a comprehensive dataset collected from Kaggle, comprising diverse network traffic records. Results demonstrate the superior performance of the PCA-GAN method compared to existing techniques, achieving high accuracy and robust detection of anomalies in network traffic. The integration of PCA for dimensionality reduction and GANs for generative modeling proves to be effective in enhancing cybersecurity measures, providing a promising solution for detecting and mitigating security threats in network infrastructures. With an accuracy of around 99.12\%, the suggested method which uses Python software outperforms other existing techniques like CNN-GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-LSTM, and Conv-LSTM by 1.49\%.

The development of serious games is an expensive and complex process that requires the participation of different experts (e.g. domain, educators, graphic artists, and programmers). We consider that new generative AI techniques can help in the prototyping of serious games by reducing and automating some of the processes involved. There is increasing evidence that generative AI techniques such as ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot can increase the productivity of writing or coding tasks respectively. In our case, both prototyping and teaching serious games are complex because of the number and diversity of tasks involved and we are currently investigating whether AI techniques can be used to improve and simplify the process. For example, ChatGPT could support the process of creating the game narrative, and other systems such as Stable Diffusion could ease the creation of some of the graphics resources (e.g., for creating more cohesive and coherent backgrounds). Automating some of the costlier processes of game prototyping can contribute to creating better products by allowing the playtesting of different options for more effective games. As the field of generative AI is in continuous change, this paper presents a working methodology to simplify the development of serious games, that has been instantiated with concrete tools. This working methodology has been piloted effectively by one student from a Master of Design for the development of a serious game and will be tested in a serious games development course. In the article we also explore how these AI techniques can be combined with a game authoring environment such as uAdventure to systematize the development of serious games. The use of Generative AI offers great potential for improving the development of serious games and needs to be further researched alongside its applications for game-based learning education.",

Next, we provide a focused review of mobile and edge networks, emphasizing the specific challenges and requirements of these environments. We further conduct a case study demonstrating the effectiveness of these strategies by deploying LLMs on real mobile edge devices. Experimental results highlight the practicality of democratized LLMs, with significant improvements in generalization accuracy, hallucination rate, accessibility, and resource consumption. Finally, we discuss potential research directions to further advance the deployment of generative AI in resource-constrained environments.",

    abstract = "Current studies for brain-muscle modulation often analyze selected properties in electrophysiological signals, leading to a partial understanding. This article proposes a cross-modal generative model that converts brain activities measured by electroencephalography (EEG) to corresponding muscular responses recorded by electromyography (EMG). Examining the generation process in the model highlights how the motor cue, representing implicit motor information hidden within brain activities, modulates the interaction between brain and muscle systems. The proposed model employs a two-stage generation process to bridge the semantic gap in cross-modal signals. Initially, the shared movement-related information between EEG and EMG signals is extracted using a contrastive learning framework. These shared representations act as conditional vectors in the subsequent EMG generation stage based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). Experiments on a self-collected multimodal electrophysiological signal data set show the algorithm’s superiority over existing time series generative methods in cross-modal EMG generation. Further insights derived from the model’s inference process underscore the brain’s strategy for muscle control during movements. This research provides a data-driven approach for the neuroscience community, offering a comprehensive perspective of brain-muscular modulation.",

This work investigates the use of a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture, Fine Tuned EfficientN etB3, for the automated categorization of various eye illnesses. We use a large collection of 3,424 high-quality retinal pictures taken from several repositories and annotated by professionals. We raise the quality of the dataset by using rigorous preprocessing and augmentation techniques. Fine-tuned via transfer learning, the EfficientN etB3 model shows great performance with a 94\% general accuracy. Evaluations of precision, recall and F l-score show the consistency of the model across several disease diagnoses. Particularly in underdeveloped areas, the model's exceptional accuracy and efficiency emphasize its capacity to improve clinical operations, raise diagnosis accuracy, and give access to professional eye care. Our efforts provide scalable solutions for early and accurate eye disease diagnosis, therefore advancing the expanding field of artificial intelligence-driven medical diagnostics.",

The CFG’s ability to transform digital representation is its primary significance. It allows users to generate a variety of lifelike faces by utilizing cutting-edge deep learning techniques like GANs and VAEs, making for more engaging digital experiences and fostering greater individual expression. Modern technologies and ethical considerations are incorporated into the study approach. The architecture of the CFG is made to gradually add layers of complexity to faces as they are generated, giving them a more realistic appearance. In order to prevent offensive content, an easy-to-use customizing interface is created. The key result of from this research project includes a face creation system that is extremely adjustable and morally upright. The usefulness of the CFG is shown through quantitative metrics assessing diversity, realism, and user happiness together with qualitative evaluations. The CFG has enormous global relevance. It opens up a new level of inclusion and personalization in digital settings, having an impact on fields that depend on visual communication.

Along with research progress, they have encroached upon many different fields and disciplines. Some of them require high level of accountability and thus transparency, for example, the medical sector. Explanations for machine decisions and predictions are thus needed to justify their reliability. This requires greater interpretability, which often means we need to understand the mechanism underlying the algorithms. Unfortunately, the blackbox nature of the DL is still unresolved, and many machine decisions are still poorly understood. We provide a review on interpretabilities suggested by different research works and categorize them. The different categories show different dimensions in interpretability research, from approaches that provide “obviously” interpretable information to the studies of complex patterns. By applying the same categorization to interpretability in medical research, it is hoped that: 1) clinicians and practitioners can subsequently approach these methods with caution; 2) insight into interpretability will be born with more considerations for medical practices; and 3) initiatives to push forward data-based, mathematically grounded, and technically grounded medical education are encouraged.",

It acquires both a low-energy image, comparable to standard mammography, and a high-energy image, which are then combined to produce a dual-energy subtracted image highlighting lesion contrast enhancement. While CESM offers superior diagnostic accuracy compared to standard mammography, its use entails higher radiation exposure and potential side effects associated with the contrast medium. To address these limitations, we propose Seg-CycleGAN, a generative deep learning framework for Virtual Contrast Enhancement in CESM. The model synthesizes high-fidelity dual-energy subtracted images from low-energy images, leveraging lesion segmentation maps to guide the generative process and improve lesion reconstruction. Building upon the standard CycleGAN architecture, Seg-CycleGAN introduces localized loss terms focused on lesion areas, enhancing the synthesis of diagnostically relevant regions. Experiments on the CESM@UCBM dataset demonstrate that Seg-CycleGAN outperforms the baseline in terms of PSNR and SSIM, while maintaining competitive MSE and VIF. Qualitative evaluations further confirm improved lesion fidelity in the generated images. These results suggest that segmentation-aware generative models offer a viable pathway toward contrast-free CESM alternatives.",

The most important advantage of our work is that it can significantly reduce the failure risks of being deceived by adversarial examples, which is critical for safety-prioritized and delay-sensitive environments.

Conventional methods of generating art—typically based on rule-based systems or fixed templates—fail to engage the complexity, emotional depth, and stylistic variety that typify contemporary works of art. These existing drawbacks commonly lead to stiff and dull outputs that never manage to express rich artistic intent. To solve this aforementioned drawback, the current research investigates a hybrid AI strategy that exploits the strengths of StyleGAN and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. In the suggested framework StyleGAN, is utilized to produce high-resolution and visually appealing visual artworks through training with a curated collection of classical and modern works. The latent vectors from the output are further analyzed by LSTM networks to add sequential and thematic aspects, adding contextual and emotional richness to the created work of art. The system was strictly tested using both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The system attained an FID score of 8.2 and a user satisfaction rate of 96\% and has proven effective in creating visually engaging and emotionally appealing AI-generated pieces of art.",

This study presents an empirical study on incorporating MATH41 into a 15-week pre-service teacher preparation course for mathematics majors. Twenty-four participants learned to create parameterized math problems, generate vector graphics. Following guided training, each participant designed and micro-taught a 20-minute lesson incorporating MATH41-generated resources. Reflection journals and final lesson plans were analyzed thematically, while 20 participants completed a self-assessment survey on lesson design competency. Results reveal that the automated problem generation capabilities motivated pre-service teachers to explore a broader range of instructional strategies, including personalized tasks and diverse problem variants. Reflection data indicate that while integrating AI tools can significantly boost confidence and creativity in lesson planning, careful pedagogical alignment remains essential to avoid superficial learning. Participants underscored the importance of maintaining teacher oversight—especially when adapting AI-generated problems for particular learner needs. Additionally, their post-course self-assessments showed high confidence in digital tool integration, yet they acknowledged that anticipating student misconceptions requires further field experience. Overall, this study contributes to understanding how teacher education programs can enhance lesson design competencies via structured AI tool integration. It also highlights the critical role of reflective practice in ensuring that automated content creation fosters deeper instructional effectiveness rather than uncritical AI dependency.",

Experimental results demonstrate that the multimodal data fusion significantly improves the accuracy of urban functional area classification, achieving superior performance metrics compared to single-modal approaches.

All these trends significantly brought real-time, hardware dependence, low power consumption, and security requirements to the facilities, and rapidly popularized edge computing. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI) workloads also changed the computing paradigm from cloud services to mobile applications dramatically. Different from wide deployment and sufficient study of AI in the cloud or mobile platforms, AI workload performance and their resource impact on edges have not been well understood yet. There lacks an in-depth analysis and comparison of their advantages, limitations, performance, and resource consumptions in an edge environment. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive study of representative AI workloads on edge platforms. We first conduct a summary of modern edge hardware and popular AI workloads. Then we quantitatively evaluate three categories (i.e., classification, image-to-image, and segmentation) of the most popular and widely used AI applications in realistic edge environments based on Raspberry Pi, Nvidia TX2, etc. We find that interaction between hardware and neural network models incurs non-negligible impact and overhead on AI workloads at edges. Our experiments show that performance variation and difference in resource footprint limit availability of certain types of workloads and their algorithms for edge platforms, and users need to select appropriate workload, model, and algorithm based on requirements and characteristics of edge environments.",

Although challenges in designing with and for AI have been generally investigated, current systematic literature reviews have neglected to consider the tensions between AI and human designers during design work and how that work is impacted. Our study extends previous work by offering a more nuanced understanding of how AI affects designers’ work, thought processes, and solutions. Research methodology: Using the PRISMA framework, we conducted a systematic review of 44 articles specifically addressing tensions between human designers and AI in design work. We employed a hybrid inductive/deductive thematic analysis approach, using Miro for remote qualitative analysis. Results and discussion: Our thematic analysis reveals four main themes that encapsulate the multifaceted impact of AI on design practice: 1. reframing design roles and work, 2. human-AI-(human) interaction and collaboration, 3. cognitive expansion and critical reflection, and 4. limitations and risks of AI. These themes collectively offer insights into the multifaceted nature of AI’s impact on human designers in this new paradigm of practice. Conclusions and further research: This review has significant implications for researchers and practitioners in design. It reflects the current complexities of integrating AI into design processes while preserving human creativity, intuition, and agency. We further identify research gaps and suggest directions for future research and practice in design domains.",

The inspirational idea of working in GANs has been derived from game theory, named as the zero-sum game. GANs consist of two components-a generator as well as a discriminator both of which act like two players of the game playing in opposition with each other. This paper focuses on the basic theory and principle mechanism of GANs. Next, the paper discusses few variants based on architecture as well as loss functions of some kinds. Finally, the last section of paper presents few other variants of GANs which are implemented in the field of computer vision and other real world problems. It is found that this area has a wider scope in terms of virtual real interaction and integration along with parallel learning. So it is considered as new implementation area for GANs in the coming future.",

Traditionally, architects use various tools to create architectural blueprints, including Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, use case diagrams, component diagrams, deployment diagrams, activity diagrams, and state diagrams, to name a few. Many of these diagrams follow repetitive patterns that could be automated with well-defined contexts. This paper examines Copilot's role in supporting architects through various stages of architectural development, evaluating how closely Copilot-generated outputs align with established architectural principles. By analyzing deviations, the study discusses how refined prompts can yield more accurate results.

However, such models often fail to connect the generated outputs and desired target concepts/preferences implied by the prompts. Current research addressing this limitation has largely focused on enhancing the prompts before output generation or improving the model’s performance up front. In contrast, this paper conceptualizes prompt evolution, imparting evolutionary selection pressure and variation during the generative process to produce multiple outputs that satisfy the target concepts/preferences better. We propose a multi-objective instantiation of this broader idea that uses a multi-label image classifier-guided approach. The predicted labels from the classifiers serve as multiple objectives to optimize, with the aim of producing diversified images that meet user preferences. A novelty of our evolutionary algorithm is that the pre-trained generative model gives us implicit mutation operations, leveraging the model’s stochastic generative capability to automate the creation of Pareto-optimized images more faithful to user preferences.",

Addressing a gap in current educational technology, this article introduces an AI Knowledge Assistant specifically designed to overcome the limitations of the existing tools by enhancing the quality and relevance of large language models (LLMs). It achieves this through the innovative integration of contextual knowledge from a local “lessons learned” database tailored to the capstone course. We conducted a study with 150 students using the assistant during their capstone course. Integrated into the Kanban project tracking system, the assistant offered recommendations using different strategies: direct searches in the lessons learned database, direct queries to a generative pretrained transformers (GPT) model, query enrichment with lessons learned before submission to GPT and large language model meta AI (LLaMa) models, and query enhancement with Stack Overflow data before GPT processing. Survey results underscored a strong preference among students for direct LLM queries and those enriched with local repository insights, highlighting the assistant's practical value. Furthermore, our linguistic analysis conclusively demonstrated that texts generated by the LLM closely mirrored the linguistic standards and topical relevance of university course requirements. This alignment not only fosters a deeper understanding of course content but also significantly enhances the material's applicability to real-world scenarios.",

However, it is highly unpredictable because of market sentiments on the social media. However, the results are challenging due to lower temporal depiction and unreliable and lower dataset. This paper presents the long short-term memory (LSTM) for the stock market sentiment prediction (SMSP) and linear regression (LR) for the exact price prediction. The generative adversarial network (GAN) is used for creating the synthetic samples as a part of data augmentation to reduce class imbalance problem. The outcomes are validated on public stock market prediction data and LSTM-GAN resulted in improved overall accuracy of 90.8\%, recall of 91.4\%, precision of 90.1\%, F1-Score of 90.4\%, selectivity of 90.1\% and negative prediction rate (NPV) of 91.4\%.

In image translation tasks with significant geometric variations, conventional image translation algorithms have led to the generation of low-quality images due to unstable training. To address this matter, this paper proposes an unsupervised image translation method that combines a Self-Attention module. Specifically, first, the proposed model constructs the Generative Self-Attention Module and embeds it between the residual blocks and up-sampling in the generator, while inserting it in the discriminator before down-sampling. Then, the number of residual blocks is modified. Finally, a residual attention mechanism is introduced in the discriminator, which helps to propagate the features further. In particular, the model enhances the ability of the generator to extract deeper features at the central pixels, further improving the ability to transform the spatial details of the image and guiding the generator to generate more realistic images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model has preferable superiority and performance to the existing unsupervised image translation models.",

This article examines the word cloud, a toolkit often used to scaffold teaching and learning for reflection, critical thinking, and content learning. Addressing the issues in traditional word clouds, semantic word clouds have been developed but they are technically challenging to develop and still problematic. However, generative AI has the potential to develop efficient, accurate, creative, and accessible word clouds. Three different methods representing three major approaches of word cloud generation were developed, implemented, and user evaluated—traditional (baseline), semantic (natural language processing enhanced), and generative AI (generative pretrained transformer based)—in two different language contexts—Chinese (China case) and English (Singapore case). The findings of the study show the technical robustness of the methods, as well as provide key pedagogical insights from the user perspective of instructors of higher education courses in China and Singapore.

While adversarial training has led to significant breakthroughs in the computer vision field, biomedical research has not yet fully exploited the capabilities of generative models for data generation, and for more complex tasks such as biosignal modality transfer. We present a broad analysis on adversarial learning on biosignal data. Our study is the first in the machine learning community to focus on synthesizing 1D biosignal data using adversarial models. We consider three types of deep generative adversarial networks: a classical GAN, an adversarial AE, and a modality transfer GAN; individually designed for biosignal synthesis and modality transfer purposes. We evaluate these methods on multiple datasets for different biosignal modalites, including phonocardiogram (PCG), electrocardiogram (ECG), vectorcardiogram and 12-lead electrocardiogram. We follow subject-independent evaluation protocols, by evaluating the proposed models' performance on completely unseen data to demonstrate generalizability. We achieve superior results in generating biosignals, specifically in conditional generation, by synthesizing realistic samples while preserving domain-relevant characteristics. We also demonstrate insightful results in biosignal modality transfer that can generate expanded representations from fewer input-leads, ultimately making the clinical monitoring setting more convenient for the patient. Furthermore our longer duration ECGs generated, maintain clear ECG rhythmic regions, which has been proven using ad-hoc segmentation models.",

By designing the capsule blocks in both the generator and discriminator and a novel multi-way optimization function, our framework can generate more realistic images than other frameworks. For the specific application, effect rendering, an effective line preservation loss is well designed and helps the framework to focus the synthesis of the texture around the lines, which not only improves the local line visual effect, but also enhance the global lighting effect around the lines. The experiments show that our improvement is effective and provides significant help to the overall framework.

    abstract = "Design thinking (DT), widely recognized as a structured method for fostering creativity and innovation, has gained significant traction in research and practice across various disciplines. However, with the rise of disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), DT practices are gradually evolving, reshaping the innovation process. This study investigates the effectiveness of integrating generative AI into a product design thinking activity, employing a single-group pretest-posttest design (i.e., without a control group). The time interval between pretest and posttest measurements was four hours, coinciding with the duration of the DT activity. Conducted in a chemical engineering course at a private university in central Mexico, the research tasked nine students of average academic performance with designing a new beverage. Over a four-hour session, students used AI tools-ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini-at various stages of the design process, including empathy mapping, need statements, idea classification, hills writing, and storyboarding. Several multidimensional constructs were measured using self-report questionnaires to assess the key attributes that DT stimulates: perceptions of creative self-efficacy, design thinking mindset, and empathy. Additionally, the study explored students' views on the usefulness of generative AI and their intention to use such tools. It was hypothesized that post-test scores for each construct would increase. The analysis involved two phases: first, psychometric indicators (alpha reliability) were obtained; second, a statistical approach for assessing individual change was applied, precisely the standardized individual difference (SID). The SID was set at a nominal level of 0.80 (right tail of the normal distribution). Scores with unacceptable measurement error (alpha <. 60) were excluded from the primary analysis. The results revealed a significant increase in students' perceived usefulness of AI between pre- and post-experiment measurements, with a moderate improvement in affective empathy. Other constructs also showed consistent, though modest, post-test score increases. However, only a few participants exceeded the SID threshold, indicating individual variations in response to the intervention. These preliminary findings highlight AI's potential to enhance student creativity through idea generation and expand their consideration of the end user in product design. The results provide valuable insights and recommendations for integrating AI into innovation-driven projects using the design thinking approach and implementing a single-group pretest-posttest design with short time intervals.",

We survey important trends in this area and introduce future applications by touching upon the issue of explainable AI. Although Generative AI has a bright future, it faces formidable challenges in our industries and society.

The present paper has addressed the state of intensity estimation for thermal currents (TCs) worldwide, with a focus on the NIO region. Conventionally, the Dvorak technique and its various versions are being used for satellite images to detect the intensity of TCs manually; however, a lot of efforts have been invested to develop artificial intelligence based alternatives for this. The paper examines the importance of Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) for estimating the intensity of TCs and their advantages over satellite images. The performance of the current IMD system is also highlighted in this paper. The average annual absolute intensity forecast skill for TCs in the period of 2013 to 2023 has been reported to be 74.95\%. Further, the paper outlines existing challenges in the present system of intensity estimation for TCs. Finally, the paper outlines future research directions and underscores the critical need for an efficient artificial intelligence-based system for better intensity estimation of TCs.",

One of the most efficient approaches in this area is encryption, which is one of the strategies used to protect the data in the picture. Here, we focus on two key steps: confusion and dispersion. The deep neural network is modified by the amount of weight that has the most impact on the output, whether it be an intermediate result or an elimination output, in addition to an unorganised structure that is undetected utilising deep neural network techniques. The proposed method used colour and greyscale images by segmenting them according to the Region of Interest of the deep neural network algorithm. In order to randomly construct an unpredictable structure that involved the addition or deletion of columns and as well as the rows, the method was then utilised to randomly distribute the pixels inside the designated region and generate random integers. To demonstrate the value of the suggested approach, the suggested algorithm is assessed in a number of ways and contrasted with the current approaches.

Deep learning approaches have gained popularity for analysing medical images for automatic diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning models such as VGG16, ResNet50 and DenseNet121 are found to be suitable for image processing. However, as one size does not fit all, there is need for optimizing these models in order to adapt them for brain stroke detection and leverage their performance. Towards this end, in this paper, we proposed an AI enabled framework with optimizations to the aforementioned deep models. Towards this end we proposed an algorithm known as Intelligent Learning for Stroke Detection (ILSD). The optimized models are found to have increased prediction performance. Enhanced DenseNet121 showed highest accuracy with 99.82\%.",

Many existing video colorization techniques operate frame-by-frame, often overlooking the critical aspect of temporal coherence between successive frames. This approach can result in inconsistencies across frames, leading to undesirable effects like flickering or abrupt color transitions between frames. To address these challenges, we combine the generative capabilities of a fine-tuned latent diffusion model with an autoregressive conditioning mechanism to ensure temporal consistency in automatic speaker video colorization. We demonstrate strong improvements on established quality metrics compared to existing methods, namely, PSNR, SSIM, FID, FVD, NIQE and BRISQUE. Specifically, we achieve an 18\% improvement in performance when FVD is employed as the evaluation metric. Furthermore, we performed a subjective study, where users preferred LatentColorization to the existing state-of-the-art DeOldify 80\% of the time.

Generative AI significantly improves the development efficiency and creative boundaries of digital learning resources by rapidly generating LEGO model prototypes and assisting interdisciplinary curriculum design. At the same time, it dynamically adjusts task difficulty and provides real-time feedback by analyzing student behavioral data, enabling truly personalized learning support. These applications lower the threshold of innovation, expand educational possibilities, and promote the construction of a sustainable education ecosystem by optimizing the reuse of resources. However, this convergence also poses key techno-ethical risks, including data bias, privacy concerns arising from excessive data collection from children, and homogenization of creativity due to AI “best solution” algorithms. To address this issue, we propose a two-track evaluation mechanism for “ethical education” that defines the boundaries of human-computer collaboration, and emphasizes the need for shared social responsibility to ensure positive empowerment in the generation of AI.

The study first proposes a digital teaching system that enables the IoT and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to play a role in art education by monitoring students’ creative state in real-time, providing immediate feedback, and facilitating the generation of creative works. The system framework includes sensor nodes, an IoT platform, a GAN model, and a user interface to build a real-time interactive environment. Sensor nodes constantly collect physiological, movement, and environmental data from students, and the GAN model receives student data from the IoT platform, combining creative input from students to generate artwork in real-time. The generated works are transmitted to the discriminator through the IoT platform, which evaluates their quality and provides real-time feedback. Students interact with the system through the user interface, observe the generated artwork, adjust generator parameters, and propose new ideas. These interactions influence further artistic creation. The WikiArt public art creation dataset is selected to establish the experimental foundation, and the experimental evaluation focuses on image generation quality, system performance, and student learning outcomes. It is compared with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models. The research results indicate that the designed IoT and GANs integrated system remarkably outperforms DCGAN and VAE in image generation quality, with an Inception Score of 4.5, which is more diverse and recognizable than other models. Regarding system performance, the IoT and GANs integrated system is significantly ahead in image generation speed and user interaction, with a transmission speed of up to 200 Mbps. Regarding student learning outcomes, the system performs excellently in emotional feedback, learning outcomes, and creative work quality, achieving 80\% satisfaction and 90\% positive feedback. Overall, the research conclusion clearly points out that the integration of IoT and GANs has a significant and comprehensive effect on improving the quality of art education.

    abstract = "In recent years, the deep learning, and artificial intelligence, have advanced rapidly and make significant breakthroughs with the help of generative architectures. In general, these are broadly broken down into either Text to image (T2I) architectures or Large Language Models (LLMs). Generating AI has been broadly explored in most domains, but the detection of long tailed is undeveloped. The scarcity of data for tail classes becomes the key challenge among its shortage in long-tailed image classification, and thus poor generalization tends to occur. To address this issue, traditional methods make use of constructive learning, mix based augmentation, re weighting, and resampling. But still, all these techniques do not generalize well to the representations of tail classes for data imbalance. In order to tackle the limitations of it, this research develops a hybrid generative learning model with synthetic data augmentation, contrastive learning, and adaptive label correction for improving long tailed image detection. The architecture takes advantage of T2I models to create synthetic data that is then refined via mix-based augmentation (MixUP and CutMix) and processed through Contrastive learning base encoder. The meaningful representations are extracted using a ResNet backbone and the model generalization is improved using supervised contrastive learning (SCL). Moreover, there is a label correction module which dynamically identifies low quality synthetic labels using KNN method, providing data integrity. The proposed method is also demonstrated to significantly improve the classification accuracy for the tail classes, and to outperform conventional techniques. Generative AI is shown to promise to fill the gap between synthetically and real-life data and make robust long tailed image classification possible with an adaptive and correcting nature.",

    abstract = "AI facial recognition for real-time emotion detection in online learning environments intends to analyze students’ sentiments throughout online classes, recognizing emotions such as focused, neutral, distracted, enraged, thrilled, or dissatisfied states. The proposed approach uses a generative model trained by conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) to accomplish De-expression Residue Learning (DeRL), a facial expression recognition technique. DeRL prioritizes gathering residue for delicate emotion recognition by filtering expressive material and storing it in intermediary layers. This technology gives educators and researchers real-time insights into students’ emotional states, allowing for a more thorough understanding of collective student involvement through the lens of socially shared control of learning. Experiments on seven facial expression databases, including two pre-training datasets, indicate that DeRL outperforms other methods in accurately recognizing and classifying students’ emotions.

This systematic review paper categorizes and classifies AI algorithms and tools in the healthcare sector to support more sustainable practices, focusing on reducing energy use while maintaining high standards in diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. AI algorithms and tools are categorized into three groups: explicit AI algorithms for sustainability for energy efficiency (e.g., Federated Learning, Hybrid Quantum-Classical Optimization, Modified Lempel-Ziv-Welch (mLZW)), traditional AI algorithms for sustainable healthcare (e.g., Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Backpropagation Neural Networks (BPNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)), and sustainable AI techniques (e.g., Adaptive Sampling, AutoML for Model Compression (AMC)) that support low-power computing (e.g., edge computing, neuromorphic hardware, adaptive sampling). A comprehensive performance analysis is presented across five dimensions: energy consumption, latency, accuracy, complexity, and cost. The review highlights mLZW as promising for energy efficiency, complexity, and cost, OFA for low-latency deployment, and Hybrid Quantum Classical Optimization for diagnostic accuracy. We propose an integration framework for deploying these methods in resource-constrained healthcare environments, identifying open research challenges and future directions. This work provides a foundational guide for researchers and sector practitioners to build energy-aware, high-performance AI systems in healthcare.",

Four complementary categories are identified, each presenting diverse opportunities and challenges:1)Leveraging AI to improve instruction: This involves using AI to create new and more powerful learning opportunities for learners – at all levels of schools and across subject areas as well as instructional contexts.2)Promoting AI Literacy: This involves helping everyone develop sufficient understanding of AI to function in a society where AI is increasingly used.3)Rethinking workforce preparation: This involves responding to the need to change how we prepare future workers, once uses of AI take over functions previously performed by humans in specific occupations.4)Leveraging AI to support educators’ own work: While the focus of the previous three categories is on student learning, here the focus shifts on educators’ using AI in their work to increase their productivity and well-being.In what follows, I will examine each of these areas using conceptual analysis, building on findings from relevant research studies I have been involved in, as well as recent conversations within an interdisciplinary group of faculty, staff and students as part of an internal planning grant for the University of Rochester. For each area, after a brief introduction I will identify and discuss a few key elements; selected illustrations, in most cases reporting findings from relevant research projects, will also be provided in separate “boxes” so they can be read independently.For further information about this paper please contact the author.",

    abstract = "Sustainability, to describe it in simpler words, is a process of making things less bad. It is not a long-term solution even if it limits the destruction of the environment to a manageable level. Nevertheless, by just becoming sustainable, one cannot bring back what has been lost. The restoration approach is immediately required to fixing what has been broken by using renewable energy, reforestation and creating biodiversity gains. Redesigning our industrial system of production and consumption around the circular patterns of resource and energy use that we observe in mature ecosystems is a must and a complex endeavour. To create a truly regenerative economy challenges us to work with huge amounts of data. New techniques of data science and artificial intelligence are required in each step of the ecological design. This paper presents some examples of biomimicry in circular design and proposes techniques that integrate data science and artificial intelligence (AI) as tools to accelerate the transition towards the regenerative approach. AI, as an emergent `Fourth Industrial Revolution' technology, can support and accelerate the pace of human innovation to design the future urban developments, to enable innovation in cities. AI has the capability to create a step change, to support an effective economic system that is regenerative by design.",

When the initial digital cultural heritage data began to be accumulated, the focus was on ‘recording’ rather than ‘public disclosure’, so the data disclosed to the public was extremely small. In addition, unlike systematically managed cultural heritage, ‘replicated data’ in digital form is relatively unstructured in terms of creation, management, and storage. To systematize the many digital data that are piled up in a disorderly manner, a lot of manpower and cost must be invested, but there are limits to solving this with limited resources. This study proposes a standard for classifying cultural heritage data by introducing artificial intelligence technology to solve these problems, and further suggests ways to use digital data more creatively using artificial intelligence technology.",

This research recognizes the potential of AI in fintech for digital society while focusing on the transition toward Industry 5.0, which is based on human-AI collaboration.

ANI has improved efficiency via credit risk assessment, customer service automation, and fraud detection, whereas AGI aims for more comprehensive decision-making capabilities. ANI and AGI are creating a gap in accomplishing a truly responsive, customer-centric system as it cannot fully adapt to subtle decision-making or erratic market shifts.

How to efficiently impute the traffic data is an urgent problem. As a classic deep learning method, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) achieves remarkable success in image recovery fields, which opens up a new way for the traffic data imputation. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal GAN model for the traffic data imputation (STGAN). Firstly, we design the generative loss and center loss, which not only minimizes the reconstructed errors of the imputed entries, but also ensures each imputed entry and its neighbors conform to the local spatio-temporal distribution. Then, the discriminator uses the convolution neural network classifier to judge whether the imputed matrix conforms to the global spatio-temporal distribution. As for the network architecture of the generator, we introduce the skip-connection to keep all well preserved data unchanged, and employ the dilated convolution to capture the spatio-temporal correlation in the traffic data. The experimental results show that our proposed method obviously outperforms other competitive traffic data imputation methods.",

    abstract = "The rapid evolution of network technologies and frequent network intrusions have amplified the demand for intrusion detection systems (IDSs) powered by artificial intelligence (AI). However, the performance of IDSs is limited by labeled intrusion data and class imbalances in existing datasets. Collecting such data through live network simulations is costly, insecure, and poses regulatory challenges. This paper presents a multi-model framework that uses a conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN) to synthesize realistic network intrusion data. The framework addresses challenges such as unstable training, mode collapse, and handling mixed data types, which are common in most generative AI models when applied to non-Gaussian tabular data generation while validating the synthesized data through qualitative and quantitative analyses. Overlaid density histograms and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) are used for qualitative analysis. For quantitative analysis, the train-real-test-synthetic (TRTS) and train-synthetic-test-real (TSTR) methods, as well as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, are utilized. The TRTS and TSTR methods are classifier-based approaches with classification accuracies of 98.36\% and 97.95\%, respectively, and are used to assess the synthesized intrusion data to ensure the interchangeability of the synthesized intrusion data and real-world intrusion data for training IDSs. The KS test results indicate a similarity score of 0.92 between real and synthesized data. Additionally, to provide interpretable insights into the performance of the model and refrain from using real-world intrusion data for analysis purposes, the framework employs an explainable AI (XAI) approach called local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME), enabling network security analysts to interpret features that influence the intrusive nature of the synthesized network intrusion data while preserving data privacy.",

Fortunately, Generative AI (GAI) holds immense potential to reduce carbon emissions of AIoT due to its excellent reasoning and generation capabilities. In this article, we explore the potential of GAI for carbon emissions reduction and propose a novel GAI-enabled solution for low-carbon AIoT. Specifically, we first study the main impacts that cause carbon emissions in AIoT, and then introduce GAI techniques and their relations to carbon emissions. We then explore the application prospects of GAI in low-carbon AIoT, focusing on how GAI can reduce carbon emissions of network components. Subsequently, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled carbon emission optimization framework, in which we design pluggable LLM and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) modules to generate more accurate and reliable optimization problems. Furthermore, we utilize Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) to identify optimal strategies for carbon emission reduction. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

This framework is novel as it is the first attempt to incorporate difference images for synthesizing medical images. Experimental results based on a 355-demented patient dataset and ADNI-1 dataset suggest that, this new framework outperforms all state-of-the-arts in ASL image synthesis. Also, synthesized ASL images obtained by this new framework are capable to significantly improve the accuracy of dementia diseases diagnosis performance.",

In addition to this comprehensive analysis, we present our own implementation of a GAN model tailored for specific image generation tasks. Our model is tested on multiple datasets to evaluate its performance, highlighting improvements in training stability and image quality. We discuss the architectural choices, optimization techniques, and training procedures employed in our implementation. Furthermore, we address the challenges faced in the field, such as mode collapse, training instability, and the need for largescale datasets. Our findings offer valuable insights into optimizing GAN performance and propose potential directions for future research. This comprehensive analysis serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners aiming to leverage GANs for advanced image generation tasks, pushing the boundaries of what is visually conceivable through artificial intelligence.",

    abstract = "Artificial intelligence (AI) research is becoming a growing trend as a result of recent improvements in machine learning. Development and grasping knowledge of art is perhaps the most subtle field of interest in the ongoing study of the “Human Vs AI” relationship. Several fascinating projects have grown up at the intersection of AI and art, but understanding and appreciating the beauty of art is still thought to be only human capacities. This paper discusses pertinent features and discoveries made by several scholars in the creation of AI art. Many scholars use GAN, but as this field of study continues to advance, many new techniques have emerged, including DALL-E, DALL-E 2, stable diffusion, multi-diffusion, DIFF EDIT, SEMSTYLE, LAFITE, and Mirror GAN. This demonstrates that there are numerous techniques for creating images, but the primary difficulty is deciding which technique is appropriate and used for text to image synthesis. So, we talked about some of the key techniques and their methodology. Three crucial techniques-DALL-E, stable diffusion, and GAN-that serve as the foundation for the creation of artificially intelligent art are discussed. Additionally, we talked about the way they work and fundamental design. Furthermore, there is also a section of the literature review that discusses the work, methodology, and restrictions of 8 researchers' models. These techniques significantly increase public interest in this subject. This paper concludes with highlights of some attractive application of the main theme in the current world.",

    abstract = "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has seen the emergence of Generative Adversarial Networks or abbreviated as GANs, a promising technology that mimics the actual world inputs to generate synthetic data. This capacity is quite promising, especially in the field of biomedical imaging, where increasing the resolution of X-rays and other medical picture data may significantly enhance clinical procedures and diagnosis. However, because medical technology has limits, obtaining high-resolution pictures of medical conditions can be difficult. There are now proven super-resolution (SR) methods available to address this issue. Rebuilding high-resolution images from their low-resolution counterparts is one of these methods, which provides more detailed information necessary for precise target identification. Super-resolution’s primary objective is to raise the image’s perceived quality. Employing generative adversarial network (GAN) based high-resolution representation learning, more precisely the SRGAN model, this study offers a unique approach for SR or super-resolution of medical images. The suggested technique, called L2RSRGAN, improves upon previous models by utilizing GANs’ strengths in maintaining high-frequency picture information and recreating visual quality. Notably, L2 regularization is integrated into the generator’s residual block, which smoothest out artifacts and reduces overfitting to improve the visual quality of generated high-resolution pictures. Our studies’ findings demonstrate that our model is effective in generating high-quality super-resolved medical pictures, with a SSIM or Structural Similarity Index Measure of 0.2098 and PSNR or peak signal-to-noise ratio of 9.18.",

Conditional GAN, and VAE are designed, and investigated for different embedding types, including factor analysis based i-vector, TDNN based x-vector, and ResNet based r-vector. The proposed back-end augmentation methods are evaluated on NIST SRE 2016, and 2018 dataset.

    abstract = "Recently, data has ousted oil as the most economical resource in the world, but most companies are reluctant to share customer/user data in pure form and on a large scale due to privacy concerns. Many innovative technologies (e.g., federated learning, split learning) are employed to meet the growing demand for privacy preservation. Despite these technologies, acquiring personal data in order to optimize utility, and then sharing it on a large scale, is still very challenging. Thanks to the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), a relatively new and promising solution to resolve these challenges is to generate synthetic data (SD) by mirroring the original dataset’s properties. SD is a promising solution to address growing privacy demands as well as the utility/analytics requirements of many industry stakeholders. In this paper, we propose and implement an SD generation method from a real dataset containing both numerical and categorical attributes by using an improved conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN), and we quantify the feasibility of SD on technical and theoretical grounds. We provide a detailed analysis of SD in original and anonymized forms with the help of multiple use cases, whereas prior research simply assumed that privacy issues in SD are small because AI models do not overfit or SD has a poor connection with real data. We provide insights into the characteristics of SD (distributions, value frequencies, correlations, etc.) produced by the CGAN in relation to the real data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the pioneering work that provides an experiment-based analysis of the quality, privacy, and utility of SD in relation to a real benchmark dataset.",

Recently artificial intelligence (AI) models are being increasingly used for detection \& classification of neurological disorders based on various parameters and datasets.

The task of the Information Superhighway is to enable capturing the multimodal data (image, video, etc.) of a subject from a smartphone of a laptop webcam, and send this through a secure information channel to a cloud storage. On the storage, the data is managed using various Big Data technologies and is acted upon by the DL models. The generated recommendations are sent back through a different secure communication channel back to the mobile or laptop.

Through a qualitative study, we assess the synthetic image data by having two impartial specialists MRI and CT modalities to classify randomly selected samples from the created data as authentic (real), fraudulent (phony), or unclear. Findings show that images produced using the diffusion model can convey qualities that are otherwise highly specific to certain medical conditions in MRI and CT modalities.

This paper delves into the dual studies conducted to assess the integration of A.I. art courses into academic curricula and develop cooperative production strategies using A.I.G.C. to enhance graphic computing. The primary objective of this research is to critically assess the benefits and impediments associated with the incorporation of A.I. art courses and to proffer strategic recommendations for their systemic integration into multimedia academic programs. The initial investigation aimed at integrating A.I.G.C. courses into the D.C.A. curriculum involved a series of AI-centric lectures and an extensive survey involving 92 students. The findings revealed a preference for elective A.I.G.C. courses, with most favoring lecture-based delivery over full curriculum integration. These results underscore the need for a balanced approach that respects traditional artistic values while embracing technological advancements. Furthermore, the second study focused on the “Summer Sunshine” project, employing Stable Diffusion and LoRA models to achieve high fidelity and consistency in manga production. This case study illustrated the practical efficiencies of A.I.G.C., from reducing manual labor to enhancing artistic quality, thereby setting new standards for A.I.'s role in graphic arts. Overall, the studies highlight the potential benefits and challenges of embedding A.I. art courses into curricula and demonstrate the effective use of A.I. in manga production through A.I.G.C. technologies.

    abstract = "Advancements in information technology and the widespread use of the Internet have radically transformed global communication. Yet, these breakthroughs have also intensified challenges related to privacy and data security, particularly as sensitive information is exchanged across digital channels. In response, our research introduces a novel method that leverages artificial intelligence to conceal textual data within images, thereby enhancing security and confidentiality in digital communications. This study proposes an innovative approach where AI is employed to generate high-quality images from scratch, rather than relying on pre-existing cover images. These AI-generated images serve as secure carriers for encrypted messages, ensuring that the process not only maintains optimal image quality but also minimizes the risk of detection. A distinctive feature of our methodology is the application of RGB color masking, which preserves the visual integrity of the image while intricately embedding the hidden text. Moreover, our approach supports the encryption and concealment of Arabic text, broadening its applicability and reinforcing its relevance in diverse linguistic contexts. To evaluate the efficacy of our technique, we utilize rigorous quantitative measures such as distortion levels, accuracy of data retrieval, and detection rates. Preliminary results indicate that our method achieves superior speed, enhanced confidentiality, and significantly lower detectability when compared to traditional and modern techniques. Additionally, by integrating a mix of AI models, our approach optimizes the encryption and embedding processes, paving the way for more robust and versatile applications in digital security. Ultimately, this research not only addresses critical issues of data privacy and secure communication but also establishes a new paradigm in the field of steganography and encryption. By merging cutting-edge AI technology with advanced image processing techniques, our work lays the groundwork for more secure digital communication systems for digital security actors such as government agencies, schools, telecom providers, and messaging platforms can adopt the proposed methodology for integrating text hiding in different languages into AI-generated images, enabling a secure communication channel with high confidentiality and low vulnerability. This technology can also be easily integrated into existing encryption systems to enhance the protection of sensitive data without compromising image quality or network performance. And invites further exploration into innovative security solutions for the future.",

The education sector, in particular, requires an urgent regulatory framework. This work provides guidelines for the incorporation of GenAI into the teaching-learning process of undergraduate students, in which generative tools are promising to revolutionize both their academic and professional trajectories. Despite ongoing debates among Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) decision-makers on whether GenAI should be used for education, students are at odds on the prohibition of its use. Instead, they promptly provided specific recommendations for their peers, after a workshop on AI basics, GenAI applications, and analysis. Five student groups of divergent engineering fields collaboratively proposed usage guidelines for ChatGPT in the learning-teaching process. The authors categorized, compared, and consolidated these into a Decalogue of Use. Employing a qualitative methodology, these guidelines were contrasted with those issued by four institutions: UNESCO, Universidad de los Andes, University of Wisconsin–Madison, and Universidad Iberoamericana. Notably, these institutions concurred with students in only five out of the ten guidelines. These guidelines are of broad nature and therefore applicable across various sectors within HEIs. HEIs, as other governmental and international institutions, have been lagging in developing and implementing regulatory frameworks for GenAI, in contrast to the rapid advancement of this technology. This work offers valuable insights into students’ perceptions of GenAI use. Such evidence is instrumental for HEIs in making informed decisions regarding the regulations of these tools. Our findings encourage not only HEIs but also organizations and decision-makers to propagate the debate about ethical GenAI usage to different societal sectors. Promisingly, working as a community will empower us to make the best and pertinent decisions regarding the adoption of GenAI and other future emergent technologies.",

The human brain has evolved into gracefully dealing with ever-changing circumstances and learning from experience with the help of complex neurophysiological mechanisms. Even though artificial intelligence takes after human intelligence, traditional neural networks do not possess the ability to adapt to dynamic environments. When presented with new information, an artificial neural network (ANN) often completely forgets its prior knowledge, a phenomenon called catastrophic forgetting or catastrophic interference. Incorporating CL capabilities into ANNs is an active field of research and is integral to achieving artificial general intelligence. In this review, we revisit CL approaches and critically examine their strengths and limitations. We conclude that CL approaches should look beyond mitigating catastrophic forgetting and strive for systems that can learn, store, recall, and transfer knowledge, much like the human brain. To this end, we highlight the importance of adopting alternative brain-inspired data representations and learning algorithms and provide our perspective on promising new directions where CL could play an instrumental role.",

The following section will contextualize this evolution from the Gutenberg Press through to the digital age at this meeting point of technology and literature.

Further, the paper reflects the ethical and philosophical impact of AI literature on such questions as authorship, authenticity, and the nature of creativity. With reference to case studies and examples of AI-authored poetry and prose, this paper attempts to find some kind of line that might be drawn between so many different approaches by writers, scholars, and technologists who all vie to use AI as their muse.

However, the classification performances of these methods still suffer from weak generalization. To address this issue, the paper proposes a novel Generative Adversarial Network based on Generative Feature Constraint (GFCGAN). First, based on the LsrGAN [1], a semantic constraint module is added to restrict the generated image features by keeping the semantic information consistent. Then, in the case of keeping the semantic relationships between classes consistent, the generated image features of unseen classes are farther away from the feature prototypes of their most similar classes in both semantic and feature space so as to train the generative model and generate high-quality pseudo image features. Finally, the trained classifier is used to classify images of unseen classes. Experiments on standard datasets verify the effectiveness of our model and achieve good results.",

With recent advancements in computer vision and natural language processing, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models have evolved. With advancements in generative adversarial networks (GAN), it has become possible to create fake images/audio/and video streams of a person or use some person’s audio and visual details to fit other environments. Thus, deepfakes are specifically used to disseminate fake information and propaganda on social circles that tarnish the reputation of an individual or an organization. Recently, many surveys have focused on generating and detecting deepfake images, audio, and video streams. Existing surveys are mostly aligned toward detecting deepfake contents, but the generation process is not suitably discussed. To address the survey gap, the paper proposes a comprehensive review of deepfake generation and detection and the different ML/DL approaches to synthesize deepfake contents. We discuss a comparative analysis of deepfake models and public datasets present for deepfake detection purposes. We discuss the implementation challenges and future research directions regarding optimized approaches and models.

Simultaneously, secure and privacy-preserving mobile crowdsensing (SPPMCS) has been widely applied in data collection/acquisition due to advantages of low deployment cost, flexible implementation, and high adaptability. Since generative AI can generate new synthetic data to replace the original data to be analyzed and processed, it can lower data attacks and privacy leakage risks for the original data. Therefore, integrating generative AI into SPPMCS is feasible and significant. Moreover, this article investigates an integration of generative AI in SPPMCS, where we present potential research focuses, solutions, and case studies. Specifically, we firstly review the preliminaries for generative AI and SPPMCS, where their integration potential is presented. Then, we discuss research issues and solutions for generative AI-enabled SPPMCS, including security defense against malicious data injection, illegal authorization, malicious spectrum manipulation at the physical layer, as well as privacy protection for data content and terminals' identification and location. Next, we propose a framework for sensing data content protection with generative AI. Simulation results have clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework.

In order to mitigate various ethical concerns, national and international organisations including governmental organisations, private sectors as well as research institutes have made extensive efforts by drafting ethical principles of AI, and having active discussions on ethics of AI within and beyond the AI community. This paper investigates these efforts with a focus on the identification of fundamental ethical principles of AI and their implementations. The review found that there is a convergence around limited principles and the most prevalent principles are transparency, justice and fairness, responsibility, non-maleficence, and privacy. The investigation suggests that ethical principles need to be combined with every stages of the AI lifecycle in the implementation to ensure that the AI system is designed, implemented and deployed in an ethical manner.

As the use of GAI in learning grows increasingly prevalent among students, its adoption varies greatly from one individual to another. Despite this growing trend, research on students' use and perceptions of GAI remains relatively scarce. In our study, we employed a mixed-methods, multiple-case study design to explore the impact of GAI on students across four grades. We focused on six key areas: learning interest, independent learning, problem-solving, confidence, appropriate use, and learning enjoyment. Our results revealed that participants had optimistic expectations regarding the utilisation of GAI to facilitate their learning. They believed that GAI could contribute positively to all six dimensions, enhancing their educational experience. We found that college students exhibited a higher level of performance than high school students across all six aspects. The insights we gained from this study can inform future research in digital education, particularly in understanding the diverse ways in which students interact with and perceive GAI. By recognizing the potential of GAI in transforming education, educators and policymakers can better harness its capabilities to enhance teaching and learning experiences. Additionally, the findings can guide the development of GAI-based educational tools and resources that cater to the needs of students across different grade levels.",

    abstract = {Random media are materials with irregular structure and spatial randomness, whose macroscopic properties are usually determined by their internal microstructure. Traditional methods for medium reconstruction are usually based on numerical simulation, but the reconstruction process is not only complicated, but also the achieved reconstruction effect is not good. In recent years, with the rapid development of deep learning, generative models (e.g., Generative Adversarial Networks) have been widely used in reconstructing the microstructure of random media. However, early GANs not only cannot effectively notice the features of the input data, but also the computational and parameter storage costs can be huge during the training process. Therefore, how to compress the training cost without sacrificing the training effect turns out to be an urgent problem. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D stochastic medium reconstruction method (3DESGAN) incorporating an explainable system. 3DESGAN introduces an explainable system into the GANs, which provides "richer" correction feedback from the discriminator to the generator. The results show that the addition of an explainable system can effectively improve the quality of the generated images. In addition, in order to control the stochastic nature of the GANs reconstruction process and enable the user to control the pore distribution characteristics of the microstructure, we adopt a style-based GAN (StyleGAN) approach, which incorporates the porosity in the form of style vectors as conditional data in the training process. Meanwhile, we utilize the attention mechanism of Transformer to enhance the ability of 3DESGAN to extract features from multi-scale training images. By comparing 3DESGAN with traditional numerical generation methods, we demonstrate its advantages in terms of reconstruction quality and efficiency.},

    abstract = "Precipitation forecasting, encompassing high-resolution regional and accurate intensity forecasting, has long been a central focus in the artificial intelligence (AI) field. Generally, AI models forecast future radar precipitation sequences from historical radar precipitation sequences. However, current precipitation forecasting suffers from three issues: 1) mismatched precipitation patterns, for example, motion speed; 2) blurred precipitation field generation; and 3) inaccurate intensity forecasts. It is owing that AI models: 1) tend to simulate the average motion states and overlook individual motion (defined as the description of the motion speed, trajectory, and direction for a single precipitation sample), leading to either overestimation or underestimation of the motion speed for a specific precipitation field and 2) are inclined to filter out high-frequency components to reduce noise in the information transmission, resulting in low resolution and blurred precipitation fields. The modeling challenges impose constraints on achieving high-resolution regional and accurate intensity forecasting. Here, to the former, we propose an individual motion-driven AI (IMD-AI) method, incorporating motion matching, alignment, and refinement through constructed pattern groups. It effectively solves the mismatch in motion estimation for an individual precipitation field, ensuring global and intact regional precipitation forecasting. To the latter, we put forward a schedule sampling, patch embedding, and adversarial strategies (SPA) training mechanism, which eliminates sharp and local information loss issues during the filtering of high-frequency components. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IMD-AI achieves accurate motion estimation of individual precipitation fields and generates high-resolution regional and accurate intensity forecasting.",

In the first stage, we propose an adversarial training approach using generative adversarial networks (GAN) to help the first detector train on robust features by supplying it with adversarial examples as validation sets. Consequently, the classifier would perform very well against adversarial attacks. Then, we propose a deep learning (DL) model for the second detector to identify intrusions. We evaluated the proposed approach's efficiency in terms of detection accuracy and robustness against adversarial attacks. Experiment results with a new cyber security dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in detecting both intrusions and persistent adversarial examples with a weighted avg of 96\%, 95\%, 95 \%, and 95\% for precision, recall, f-score, and accuracy, respectively.",

    abstract = "Skin diseases are prevalent in Thailand due to the hot temperatures, humid climate, and increasing diversity of skin tones, which complicates diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) has improved skin disease detection through deep learning models, aiding faster diagnoses and reducing the workload on dermatologists. However, AI models often struggle with underrepresentation of darker skin tones in training datasets, affecting performance. To address this imbalance, data augmentation techniques like generative models are recommended. This research enhances skin disease classification using StyleGAN3 for data augmentation to balance minority skin tone classes. The Fitzpatrick17k dataset focusing on Acne, Psoriasis, and Vitiligo is used. The Fitzpatrick Skin Type Scale is reduced from six to three levels due to image availability. VGG16 is applied to classify skin tone classes. Two additional datasets, the original and traditionally augmented datasets, are used for comparison against the StyleGAN3-augmented dataset. Results show that the StyleGAN3-augmented dataset achieves the best performance with F1-scores of 0.7193, 0.7446, and 0.7543 and accuracy scores of 0.7200, 0.7368, and 0.7419 for Acne, Psoriasis, and Vitiligo respectively. The obtained results demonstrate that utilizing the StyleGAN3-augmented dataset for skin disease classification in minority skin tone classes yields the highest performance, with F1-scores increasing by 19.25\%, 19.77\%, and 25.94 \% for Acne, Psoriasis, and Vitiligo, respectively.

The ubiquity of information technology in critical industrial processes necessitates heightened security measures, and the proposed model addresses this imperative through the fusion of GANs and IDS tailored for SCADA environments. The study delves into the evolutionary trajectory of Intrusion Detection Systems, tracing their progression from conventional signature-based methods to the adaptive capabilities afforded by artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning. Against this backdrop, the paper investigates the vulnerabilities of SCADA systems, elucidating the sophisticated attack vectors identified in recent studies. The distributed nature of SCADA systems, deployed across extensive industrial landscapes, accentuates the need for robust intrusion detection mechanisms. This research's core innovation lies in applying a GAN model to SCADA systems, leveraging the distributed network protocol version 3 (DNP3) for data access authorization. The model is trained on a dataset comprising 12 meticulously selected features from DNP3 packets, attuning it to the nuances of SCADA network traffic. Notably, the proposed GAN-based IDS demonstrates exceptional efficacy, achieving impressive accuracy. Beyond the empirical contributions, the paper envisions future directions for integrating explainable AI techniques and enhancing the interpretability of IDS models specific to SCADA environments.

However, longitudinal datasets are often incomplete due to unexpected quits of patients. In previous work, we proposed an augmentation method temporal recurrent generative adversarial network (TR-GAN) that can complement missing session data of MRI datasets. TR-GAN uses a simple U-Net as a generator, which limits its performance. Transformers have had great success in the research of computer vision and this article attempts to introduce it into longitudinal dataset completion tasks. The multihead attention mechanism in transformer has huge memory requirements, and it is difficult to train 3-D MRI data on graphics processing units (GPUs) with small memory. To build a memory-friendly transformer-based generator, we introduce a Hilbert transform module (HTM) to convert 3-D data to 2-D data that preserves locality fairly well. To make up for the insufficiency of convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models that are difficult to establish long-range dependencies, we propose an Swin transformer-based up/down sampling module (STU/STD) module that combines the Swin transformer module and CNN module to capture global and local information simultaneously. Extensive experiments show that our model can reduce mean squared error (MMSE) by at least 7.16\% compared to the previous state-of-the-art method.",

That results in improvement in the technology as people find more real world practical applications for it, and then it reaches a stagnation point where you can't improvise the tech anymore. We believe that Artificial Intelligence would be the start of a new sigmoid curve. Artificial Intelligence has now reached a new peak after the maturation of ChatGPT. Currently, AI has a gradual growth rate of 21 \% per annum, creating a new market in this highly competitive industry. This paper represented the ChatGPT features, paradigm and data analysis process.",

Therefore, in this paper, we first present an Video SR model combined generative adversarial network and recurrent neural network (GAN-RNN) structure.

The perceptual loss is introduced to retain the high-frequency detail which is different from other video SR network.

    abstract = "As one of the most common neurological disorders, epilepsy poses major challenges in clinical practice. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), which is highly prevalent among drug-resistant cases, often fails to respond to anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), making surgical intervention a necessary treatment option. Consequently, accurate identification of the epileptogenic zone is essential to optimize surgical outcomes. MRI is the most widely used non-invasive imaging technique for epileptogenic focus localization, offering superior soft-tissue contrast and diagnostic accuracy. Nevertheless, the utility of MRI can be restricted due to time limitations, high costs, or certain patient-specific contraindications. Recently, the deep learning breakthroughs have made the synthesis of MRI images from CT scans possible. However, the patients undergoing both CT and MRI scans are limited, making it difficult to obtain large-scale paired datasets. In this study, we have proposed an RSPGAN method which is based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). This method has integrated image registration and temporal lobe segmentation. In the result, the images generated by the RSPGAN method achieve an SSIM of $0.97 \pm 0.02$ and a PSNR of $30.36 \pm 4.74$, with significantly reduced error metrics: MAE of $4.93 \pm 2.82$ and MSE of $79.10 \pm 43.49$, outperforming the other models. The experimental results demonstrate that our RSPGAN method achieves superior performance on limited datasets.",

One such technology is a dialogue system which is capable of generating humorous and empathetic responses for enhancing students’ learning outcomes. There is, however, limited research on the combination of humor, empathy, and culture in education. Thus, this paper proposes a dialogue system that is based on Wasserstein’s Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) for generating responses with humor, empathy, and cultural sensitivity. The dialogue system has the ability to generate responses that take into account both coarse-grained emotions at the conversation level and fine-grained emotions at the token level, allowing for a nuanced understanding of a student’s emotional state. It can utilize external knowledge and prior context to enhance the ability of AI dialogue systems to comprehend emotions in a multimodal context. It can also analyze large corpora of text and other data, providing valuable insights into cultural context, semantic properties, and language variations. The dialogue system is a promising AI technology that can improve learning outcomes in various academic fields by generating responses with humor, empathy, and cultural sensitivity. In our study, the dialogue system achieved an accuracy rate of 94.12\%, 93.83\% and 92.60\% in humor, empathy and culture models, respectively.",

Existing literature has proposed various algorithms based on different assumptions, many of which rely on the existence of appropriate generative models. Some of these assumptions, particularly the assumption regarding the existence of generative models, may be overly stringent. To address this issue, this letter introduces a novel assumption-free image counterfactual generation algorithm, DFO-S, based on Score Matching and gradient-free optimization techniques.

Research in human emotion recognition has become more popular nowadays due to the advances in the machine learning and deep learning techniques. However, the spread of COVID-19, and the need for wearing masks in the public has impacted the current emotion recognition models' performance. Therefore, improving the performance of these models requires datasets with masked faces. In this paper, we propose a model to generate realistic face masks using generative adversarial network models, in particular image inpainting. The MAFA dataset was used to train the generative image inpainting model. In addition, a face detection model was proposed to identify the mask area. The model was evaluated using the MAFA and CelebA datasets, and promising results were obtained.",

The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been shown to be responsible for causing acute respiratory distress in a large number of COVID-19 cases. When the literature is reviewed, Thorax Computed Tomography is recommended to evaluate permanent lung damage in individuals recovering from COVID-19. When tomography images are examined, the respiratory systems of patients who have had COVID-19 are significantly affected by the virus. In the study, thorax CT images of patients who had COVID-19 and then came back to the hospital and were diagnosed with COPD and Bronchiectasis were examined with artificial intelligence methods. The study consists of two stages. First, COVID-19, COPD, and Bronchiectasis datasets were trained with pre-trained deep-learning models. Then, only the COVID-19 dataset was trained with the GAN algorithm, and the model weights were recorded. Tests were performed on the COPD and Bronchiectasis dataset with the recorded model weight. The performance metric ratios of the training results obtained with the COVID-19 dataset and test trained individually and the combination of three classes was compared in the test environment. As a result of the proposed study, the highest performance rate for the classification method made in the first step was found to be 99\% in the pre-trained DenseNet201 model. In the second step of the study, model weights were recorded on the COVID-19 dataset trained with the GAN algorithm and tested on COPD and Bronchiectasis datasets. Lower loss rates are observed in the GAN algorithm compared to the models in the first stage of the study.",

Next, to determine which generative models—in terms of complexity, scalability, and ethics—are best suited for a range of tasks, we must evaluate and compare many of them. Researchers were able to validate these findings using case studies and expert interviews. The results suggest that an ordered data infrastructure is required for creative AI.

A number of LLMs on the market can be integrated with LangChain, as well as other data sources.

To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient synthetic oversampling approach, Generator Information Enhancement Generative Adversarial Networks (GIE-GAN). Its generative information is enhanced in two aspects. First, the generator can get common knowledge of all classes by initializing with a variational autoencoder. Second, during the training process, an independent classifier, which can provide accurate classification results for the generator, is added to the GAN for further augmenting the generative information. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that, compared with the rival methods, our method can generate high-quality images and obtain better classifier performance of deep learning, especially for high imbalance ratios.",

However, the existing GANs and their variants encounter many problems, including pattern collapse, training instability and falling into local optimal. Therefore, we construct a lightweight evolutionary generative adversarial network (LGEGAN) with statistic global information. To solve the problem that shallow convolutional neural networks are difficult to capture long-range feature dependence and the training process is prone to pattern collapse, LGEGAN is different from EGAN in that we add an improved self-attention mechanism to the generator network. To solve the problem of instability in the training process, we add spectral normalization to LGEGAN, which increases the stability of each generation of training process. Finally, to efficiently evolve individuals who adapt to the environment in a short time and solve the problem of falling into local optimal, different from EGAN, we construct a novel selection operator and apply it to the selection stage of LGEGAN's evolution of the generator. In the experiments, we evaluate the LGEGAN from four aspects: the quality and diversity of generated images, the collapse of patterns, the stability of training and the robustness of the architecture. The experimental results indicate that the performance of LGEGAN is better than that of EGAN, MOEGAN, SMOEGAN, LRGAN, ProbGAN and the other generative adversarial network models.",

However, very limited research has focused on developing AI or ML-based solutions for autistic individuals largely due to the scarcity of autism-related datasets. In order for autistic people to equally benefit from the breakthroughs in AI, the data representation gap in AI and ML must be addressed. The project proposes an innovative human expert and AI combined approach to generate synthetic data about autistic individuals. Through this approach, we are developing the first dataset of case studies of autistic individuals to effectively identify evidence-based practices (EBPs) to address the unique needs of autistic individuals.

Recent dramatic progress on deep learning greatly promotes the MRI analysis based on data-driven CNN methods using a large-scale longitudinal MRI dataset. However, most of the existing MRI datasets are fragmented due to unexpected quits of volunteers. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Temporal Recurrent Generative Adversarial Network (TR-GAN) to complete missing sessions of MRI datasets. Unlike existing GAN-based methods, which either fail to generate future sessions or only generate fixed-length sessions, TR-GAN takes all past sessions to recurrently and smoothly generate future ones with variant length. Specifically, TR-GAN adopts recurrent connection to deal with variant input sequence length and flexibly generate future variant sessions. Besides, we also design a multiple scale \& location (MSL) module and a SWAP module to encourage the model to better focus on detailed information, which helps to generate high-quality MRI data. Compared with other popular GAN architectures, TR-GAN achieved the best performance in all evaluation metrics of two datasets. After expanding the Whole MRI dataset, the balanced accuracy of AD vs. cognitively normal (CN) vs. mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and stable MCI vs. progressive MCI classification can be increased by 3.61\% and 4.00\%, respectively.",

Here, a hybrid strategy focused on malware detection will be proposed, where GANs and transfer learning are employed to improve the accuracy and resilience of image representations. Converting malware binaries into grayscale images may change how visual features are used to identify specific patterns that could define malware and eventually determine classification. GANs are used to generate artificial malware samples, which enhance the dataset with a variety of adversarial examples that closely mimic the diversity of actual malware. The model is therefore more resistant to deceptive infection techniques. Convolutional neural network pre-training enables transfer learning and saves resources for lengthy training from scratch and decreases the strain of training. As was previously said, the GAN-generative adversarial examples feature a wider variety of malware types that enhance its capacity to identify new threats precisely. Opposing the traditional approach, the experimental findings showed that this hybrid strategy improved the detection accuracy and decreased the rate of false positives. The reason for this is its adaptability and scalability, which qualify it for real-time malware detection.",

The Generator utilizes the environment and system specifications to generate both traditional and zero-day attack vectors. The Executor classifies attacks, assigns them to specialized workers for execution, and consolidates the results into a comprehensive report. The Defender then analyzes this report to iteratively enhance the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). This iterative process enhances the system’s resilience and robustness to future, unknown threats. The framework is adaptable, allowing customization to meet the security needs of various organizations making it well-suited for applications such as enterprise cloud security, cybersecurity education, and beyond.

Our research aims to compare the performance metrics of social bots that employ AI photos with those that use other types of photographs. To accomplish this, we analyzed a dataset with 13 748 measurements of 11 423 bots from the VK social network and identified 73 cases where bots employed generative adversarial network (GAN)-photos and 84 cases where bots employed diffusion or transformers photos. We conducted a qualitative comparison of these bots using metrics such as price, survival rate, quality, speed, and human trust. Our study findings indicate that bots that use AI-photos exhibit less danger and lower levels of sophistication compared to other types: AI-enhanced bots are less expensive, less popular on exchange platforms, of inferior quality, less likely to be operated by humans, and, as a consequence, faster and more susceptible to being blocked by social networks. We also did not observe any significant difference between GAN-based and diffusion/transformers-based bots, indicating that diffusion/transformers models did not contribute to increased bot sophistication compared to GAN models. Our contributions include a proposed methodology for evaluating the impact of photos on bot sophistication, along with a publicly available dataset for other researchers to study and analyze bots. Our research findings suggest a contradiction to theoretical expectations: in practice, bots using AI-generated photos pose less danger.",

Furthermore, the performance of AI and a human in the process of the adaption was compared and analyzed. During story creating stage, the researcher of this study employed ChatGPT to generate story structure and creative elements. ChatGPT had a great accomplishment of condensing and narrating stories, but its adjustment on emotional tones required human interventions to achieve the desired effect. Although there were several modifications prior to the ultimate ending to “war” and “tragedy” requested by the researcher, ChatGPT did still show excellent creative potential.

With character setting and costume details requiring human tweaking and integration, Midjourney excelled at color grading and atmosphere simulation, but having consistency between details and style was a challenging task for Midjourney. In the process of selecting and modifying generated content, AI tools played an important role in inciting creative ideas.

These content generation tools that use generative AI make it easier to write blogs, generate content, reply to emails, create and publish content quickly, parse text, and refer to specific information very quickly and with ease. Students use these tools in colleges and educational institutions daily on social media. GenAI tools help reconstruct sentences, correct grammar, use proper words, auto-filling information, and preempt words that make the user not think but instead follow the prompts. GenAI will impact future generations because they cannot be self-reliant and rely heavily on artificial intelligence to form sentences and write the essential content. There must be a need for AI awareness and governance adoption in AI applications and tools as an integral process with a balance on how AI adoption in educational and social networks should enrich and promote individuals in the learning process and dynamically adjust to the individual requirements and help them in crafting sentences intelligently, build information and ideas that encourage thinking process, and using standard English conventions and expression of ideas. The primary focus of this paper is to introduce the challenges of GenAI adoption in applications and tools we use daily and its exposure to Gen X, Gen Y, Gen Z, and Gen Alpha. In this paper, we will bring awareness to such GenAI tools that can adversely impact the growth of individual cognitive thinking processes and the measures that citizens should take so that Human Intelligence prevails over Artificial Intelligence.",

A rule-based native XAI algorithm, the Logic Learning Machine, is used in combination with conventional utility metrics. The classification performance in different conditions is assessed: models trained and tested on synthetic data, models trained on synthetic data and tested on real data, and models trained on real data and tested on synthetic data.

The results indicate that XAI may be used to assess the quality of synthetic data by (i) the analysis of classification performance and (ii) the analysis of the rules extracted on real and synthetic data (number, covering, structure, cut-off values, and similarity).

    abstract = "While human brains have the ability to distinguish face characteristics, the use of advanced technology and artificial intelligence blurs the difference between actual and modified images. The evolution of digital editing applications has led to the fabrication of very lifelike false faces, making it harder for humans to discriminate between real and made ones. Because of this, techniques like deep learning are being used increasingly to distinguish between real and artificial faces,producing more consistent and accurate results. In order to detect fraudulent faces, This paper introduces a pioneering hybrid deep learning model, which merges the capabilities of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and the Residual Neural Network (RESNET) architecture, aimed at detecting fake faces. By integrating GANs’ generative strength with RESNET’s discriminative abilities, the proposed model offers a novel approach to discerning real from artificial faces. Through a comparative analysis, the performance of the hybrid model is evaluated against established pre-trained models such as VGG16 and RESNET 50. Results demonstrate the superior effectiveness of the hybrid model in accurately detecting fake faces, marking a notable advancement in facial image recognition and authentication. The findings on a benchmark dataset show that the proposed model obtains outstanding performance measures, including precision 0.79, recall 0.88, F1-score 0.83, accuracy 0.83, and ROC AUC Score 0.825. The study’s conclusions highlight the hybrid model’s strong performance in identifying fake faces, especially when it comes to accuracy, precision, and memory economy. By combining the generative capacity of GANs with the discriminative capabilities of RESNET, this solves the problems caused by more complex fake face generation approaches.With significant potential for use in identity verification, social media content moderation, cybersecurity, and other areas, the study seeks to advance the field of false face identification. In these situations, being able to accurately discriminate between real and altered faces is crucial. Notably, our suggested model adds Channel-Wise Attention Mechanisms to RESNET50 at the feature extraction phase, which increases its effectiveness and boosts its overall performance.",

To this end, the image registration is a common requirement for utilizing the multimodal images. However, due to the rather different imaging mechanisms, multimodal image registration becomes much more challenging than ordinary registration, particular for optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In this work, we design a deep matching network to exploit the latent and coherent features between multimodal patch pairs for inferring their matching labels. But, the network requires immense data for training, which is not usually met. To address this issue, we propose a generative matching network (GMN) to generate the coupled optical and SAR images, hence, improve the quantity and diversity of the training data. The experimental results show that our proposal significantly improves the registration performance of optical and SAR image registration, and achieves subpixel or close to subpixel error.",

The Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) were introduced to solve some problem. The performance quality of the results has been significantly improved by DCGAN, but it still sometimes fails to produce realistic data.Due to the deficiencies above DCGAN, this paper involves the capsule network structure into the conditional generation adversarial network, and proposes the CapsuleCGAN (Capsule Conditional Generative Adverserial Networks) architecture. Through the experiment on the MNIST dataset, comparing CGAN and DCGAN, the results show that the proposed CapsuleCGAN architecture can be successfully trained.

Automated pipelines for retrieving and preprocessing large amounts of data are not always so readily available. This article examines the benefits of using self-attention ML object detection approaches in the image preprocessing stage in an autonomous manner. We focus on the case where the required preprocessing is text (noise) removal from architectural images. The model we develop is based on the state-of-the-art Text Spotting Transformer (TESTR) framework.By using our TESTR model, we demonstrate that identification and removal of unwanted text annotations on architectural floor plan image datasets are feasible. The impact of inference threshold and image scale on the removal performance is investigated. Optimal thresholds are derived between leaving text and inadvertently removing (building) content. The lower the image scale, the worse the object detection performance. Our pipeline could be used for the preprocessing of huge image datasets for removing obsolete/unwanted annotations and features to improve performance during generative adversarial network (GAN) model training.This could boost efforts to make artificial intelligence systems automatically offer suggestions and refine the building design. The application of TESTR to the architectural image data preprocessing stage as a tool for text and numerical content removal has shown promise. The recognizer decoder of TESTR provides the ability to retain the removed content information for further labeling.",

In this paper, we present a finetuned emotionally adaptive AI pipeline capable of generating personalized, human-like responses. Using a custom dataset based on six universal emotions—Sadness, Happiness, Fear, Anger, Surprise, and Disgust—collected from interviews with 30 participants, we have explored two approaches: fine-tuning a LLaMA-3 8B model with the Low-Rank Adapter (LoRA) technique and employing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent-based framework over the same LLaMA-3 8B model. Emotion classification, prompt engineering, and model fine-tuning were used over the dataset to capture emotional and personalized subtleties in the responses based on different individuals. We conducted a comprehensive analysis, evaluating performance across candidates, emotions, and overall performance, using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient to measure the difference among the outputs from both pipelines and actual human emotional responses. Our results show that prompt engineering combined with LoRA-based fine-tuning significantly enhances the ability to engage in emotionally intelligent and personalized conversations, whereas the RAG-based approach underperformed due to the pretrained LLAMA-3 model’s restrictive neutral and adversarial training. This highlights that fine-tuned LLMs are effective in replicating human emotions for personalized intelligence.",

However, most existing models have ignored the homology and diversity among protein sequences, which can reveal the functional sequence segments and indirectly reflect the structure of the protein. Consequently, the achieved performance is limited. To break through this limitation, we propose an end-to-end deep learning model for PSCL prediction, namely, MSADeepLoc. In this model, the protein features are extracted by a protein language model, the MSA Transformer. The MSA Transformer can learn the evolutionary conservation and variability among protein sequences from extensive multiple sequence alignments, effectively capturing and refining key biological information within the sequence structure. Additionally, we apply a pre-trained Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to solve the data imbalance issue. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed MSADeepLoc outperforms the state-of-the-art models in the task of PSCL prediction.",

To overcome the challenge, we propose a generative active learning framework based on a variational autoencoder. This approach aims to alleviate the scarcity of reliable data for CAD systems in veterinary medicine. This study utilizes datasets comprising cardiomegaly radiographic image data and chronic kidney disease ultrasound image data. After removing annotations and standardizing images, we employed a framework for data augmentation, which consists of a data generation phase and a query phase for filtering the generated data. The experimental results revealed that as the data generated through this framework was added to the training data of the generative model, the frechet inception distance decreased from 84.14 to 50.75 in the radiographic image and from 127.98 to 35.16 in an ultrasound image. Subsequently, when the generated data were incorporated into the training of the classification model, the true negative of the confusion matrix also improved from 0.16 to 0.66 on the radiograph and from 0.44 to 0.64 on the ultrasound image. The proposed framework has the potential to address the challenges of data scarcity in medical CAD, contributing to its advancement.",

The integration of quantum computing enhances the application's capabilities, providing a novel approach to education through dynamic storytelling.In conclusion, the proposed solution seeks to bridge the gap in traditional teaching methods by introducing an innovative and interactive approach to education using Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks.

Underwater images provide an important way for people to understand the underwater environment of the ocean. However, due to the uneven medium in water and the scattering effects of light, underwater images usually suffer from some severe degradation problems, such as color distortion and blurring. As such, underwater image enhancement is a very important and critical task in detection of underwater marine objects. To circumvent these problems, a novel generative adversarial network for underwater image enhancement is proposed. In the proposed method, the generator makes use of U-Net network structure and combines CBAM and ASPP to ensure effectiveness of multi-scale feature extraction. The discriminator employs a double-branch structure to guide the generator to generate images from global semantics to local details and enhance local details of the images. Finally, in the quantitative and qualitative analysis, the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art methods.

The model is trained on a diverse dataset comprising modern and traditional architectural styles, enabling it to transform modern architectural images into traditional styles while simultaneously categorizing the architectural style of each input. The results indicate that the model effectively generates traditional architectural styles from modern inputs, capturing key stylistic elements such as texture and form. However, the classification module reveals an imbalance in performance, with higher accuracy and lower loss for traditional style compared to modern style, suggesting areas for improvement. The findings underscore the potential of AI in revolutionizing architectural design, offering a more efficient, accurate, and streamlined process that can significantly enhance the precision and speed of architectural projects.

However, detailed studies on the subsurface geotechnical characteristics of the northern regions of Kuwait are lacking. This study focuses on establishing a preliminary geotechnical database, addressing challenges encountered during its development, and conducting a pilot analysis for AI-Mutlaa City. A questionnaire was distributed to geology, environmental, geotechnical, and engineering professionals to identify the challenges associated with creating the database. The survey revealed issues such as inconsistent data formats, limited access to borehole logs, and the hesitancy of private firms to share data due to security concerns. Despite these challenges, borehole data from ministries and private organizations were collected and organized using Microsoft Excel. These data formed the foundation of the geotechnical database, which was analyzed and visualized using Geographic Information System (GIS) tools. The pilot study in AI-Mutlaa City revealed predominantly dense soil layers, with significant variations in soil strength at a depth of 19.5 m, where standard penetration resistance ranged from 10 to 50 blows. These findings emphasize the variability of soil properties in the area and underscore the importance of site-specific investigations. The established geotechnical database provides valuable insights for construction planning, risk assessment, and geohazard management. Moving forward, the integration of artificial intelligence into the database is planned to enhance data processing, automate soil classification, and predict subsurface conditions in an effort to contribute to advanced geotechnical practices in Kuwait.",

Nonetheless, achieving high accuracy in this task still poses a challenge due to issues of inadequate amount and imbalance of data to train the models as well as issues of generalization and robustness. The findings of this research propose the use of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) data augmentation for face emotion classification specifically for this approach. The proposed strategy is based on the generation of artificial ‘emotional’ images on the face using Deep Neural Self Attention GANs (DNSAGANs). This way, to capture all the variations of facial expressions the GAN takes a large number of images and thus makes the augmented data richer and more realistic. This larger data set is then used to train a deep learning architecture that performs the face emotion classification thereby enabling the network to learn enhanced discriminative features. To collect face photos the FER2013 dataset is used. The training process, entrained the generator and discriminator to minimize the mean squared error while the discriminator was simultaneously trained to robustly distinguish generated images from real ones. Altogether, the proposed Adam optimizer was more accurate than Adagrad and Adadelta for all epochs. The percentage of accuracy is about $88.64 \\%$ for 100 epochs using the proposed optimizer techniques.",

This study employed mixed-method research to explore teachers’ perceptions of student assessment using generative AI. We collected data through interviews and surveys from Chinese universities. Our findings demonstrate that a majority of teachers agreed with the power of AI tools to enhance the overall quality of the evaluation and their work efficiency, since they can alleviate the burden associated with manual grading and offer prompt feedback. University teachers expect to prepare their knowledge and skills for the usage of new technologies through training programs and professional development opportunities. Besides, this study notes some concerns like data security and privacy fairness, biases inherent in AI algorithms, overreliance on automation, and limited critical human thinking. These challenges lead to the need for further explorations to provide holistic feedback and balance the AI assessment approach with human judgment to meet reasonable standards.

Most existing OSDA approaches, depending on the final image feature space of deep models, require manually-tuned thresholds, and may easily misclassify unknown samples as known classes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) could be a remedy. Within an MoE, different experts handle distinct input features, producing unique expert routing patterns for various classes in a routing feature space. As a result, unknown class samples may display different expert routing patterns to known classes. This paper proposes Dual-Space Detection, which exploits the inconsistencies between the image feature space and the routing feature space to detect unknown class samples without any threshold. A Graph Router is further introduced to better make use of the spatial information among the image patches. Experiments on three datasets validated the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.",

As low-quality medical images may lead to misinterpretation in diagnosis and analysis, it is important to improve quality of the improperly-acquired fundus images. Unfortunately, the existing fundus image enhancement methods require task-specific prior knowledge or suffer from insufficient generalization ability. To cope with this issue, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based model is proposed, namely the semi-supervised GAN with anatomical structure preservation (SSGAN-ASP). Specifically, an anatomical structure extraction component is employed in the generator to guide the enhancement process by preserving both retinal and lesion structures, while color information in the fundus image is also preserved. The SSGAN-ASP model is evaluated and compared with the state-of-the-art methods for medical image enhancement on three popular datasets. In addition, it is applied in the pre-processing of retinal vessel segmentation and diabetic retinopathy grading tasks to show efficacy in computer-aided diagnosis. Experimental results demonstrate that visual quality of the enhanced image can be improved while better performance in clinical diagnosis is achieved with our proposed model by adopting the anatomical structure extraction component and preserving color information as well.",

This study explores the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to create extensive fruit image datasets, concentrating on cherries, bananas, oranges, apples, and pineapples. Five generative models—Stable Diffusion v1.4, Stable Diffusion v1.5, Stable Diffusion v2, Stable Diffusion XL Refiner 1.0, and SDXL Turbo—were employed to generate 1000 images per fruit type, each set against a white background. Thresholding techniques were used to automatically extract fruit boundaries, which were then utilized to train segmentation models. The performance of these models was evaluated based on their accuracy and processing speed. SDXL Turbo consistently delivered the highest accuracy across all fruit types, though it required more processing time per image. Stable Diffusion XL Refiner 1.0 also exhibited strong accuracy but balanced performance differently. In contrast, Stable Diffusion v2 showed significant shortcomings, particularly in producing accurate images for cherries and oranges. This comparative analysis highlights the potential of advanced generative models in enhancing synthetic dataset creation for fruit object detection and segmentation in agricultural robotics.

DGA-based botnets are difficult to detect using cyber threat intelligence (CTI) systems based on blocklists. Artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML)-based CTI systems are required. This study (1) proposed a model to detect DGA-based traffic based on statistical features with datasets comprising 55 DGA families, (2) discussed how CTI can be expanded with computable CTI paradigm, and (3) described how to improve the explainability of the model outputs by blending explainable AI (XAI) and open-source intelligence (OSINT) for trust problems, an antidote for skepticism to the shared models and preventing automation bias. We define the XAI-OSINT blending as aggregations of OSINT for AI/ML model outcome validation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our models (96.3\% accuracy). Our random forest model provides better robustness against three state-of-the-art DGA adversarial attacks (CharBot, DeepDGA, MaskDGA) compared with character-based deep learning models (Endgame, CMU, NYU, MIT). We demonstrate the sharing mechanism and confirm that the XAI-OSINT blending improves trust for CTI sharing as evidence to validate our proposed computable CTI paradigm to assist security analysts in security operations centers using an automated, explainable OSINT approach (for second opinion). Therefore, the computable CTI reduces manual intervention in critical cybersecurity decision-making.",

The generator of our network model refers to Boundary Equilibrium Generative Adversarial Networks and adds spectral normalization to improving unstable training. Then, our network chooses discriminator of Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Networks which is more concise. After training, the network model is limited to generate image encoding by context loss and prior loss to make it as similar as possible to the missing image encoding. Then, the generated images encoding corresponding to the without missing parts of the real images are obtained. After fusing the generated missing parts with the unmissed parts of the real image, it is the inpainting image. By the comparisons of vision and quantization, it shows that our method can well complete the task of large missing regions.",

This research article reviews traffic actors’ behavior prediction techniques for intelligent vehicles to perceive, infer, and anticipate other vehicles’ intentions and future actions. It identifies the key strategies and methods for AI, emerging trends, datasets, and ongoing research issues in these fields. As per the authors’ knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review dedicated to the vehicle behavior study examining existing academic literature published by peer review venues between 2011 and 2021. A systematic review was undertaken to examine these papers, and five primary research questions have been addressed. The findings show that using sophisticated input representation that includes traffic rules and road geometry, artificial intelligence-based solutions applied to behavior prediction of traffic actors for intelligent vehicles have shown promising success, particularly in complex driving scenarios. Finally, the paper summarizes the most widely used approaches in behavior prediction of traffic actors for intelligent vehicles, which the authors believe serves as a foundation for future research in behavior prediction of surrounding traffic actors for secure and accurate intelligent vehicle navigation.",

    abstract = "Spatial intelligence is important in many fields, such as Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC), Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), and Medicine. Understanding three-dimensional (3D) spatial rotations can involve verbal descriptions and visual or interactive examples, illustrating how objects move and change orientation in 3D space. Recent studies show that artificial intelligence (AI) with language and vision capabilities still faces limitations in spatial reasoning. In this paper, we have studied the spatial capabilities of advanced generative AI to understand the rotations of objects in 3D space utilizing its image processing and language processing features. We examined the spatial intelligence of three generative AI models (GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Llama 3.2) to understand the spatial rotation process with spatial rotation diagrams based on the revised Purdue Spatial Visualization Test: Visualization of Rotations (Revised PSVT:R). Furthermore, we incorporated an added layer of a coordinate system axes on Revised PSVT:R to study the variations in generative AI models' performance. We additionally examined generative AI models' understanding of 3D rotations in Augmented Reality (AR) scene images that visualize spatial rotations of a physical object in 3D space and observed an increased accuracy of generative AI models' understanding of rotations by adding additional textual information depicting the rotation process or mathematical representations of the rotation (e.g., matrices) superimposed on the object. The results indicate that while GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Llama 3.2 as the main current generative AI model lack the understanding of a spatial rotation process, it has the potential to understand the rotation process with additional information that can be provided by methods such as AR. AR can superimpose textual information or mathematical representations of rotations on spatial transformation diagrams and create a more intelligible input for AI to comprehend or for training AI's spatial intelligence. Furthermore, by combining the potentials in spatial intelligence of AI with AR's interactive visualization abilities, we expect to offer enhanced guidance for students' spatial learning activities. Such spatial guidance can greatly benefit understanding spatial transformations and additionally support processes like assembly, construction, manufacturing, as well as learning in AEC, STEM, and Medicine that require precise 3D spatial understanding.",

In industries where data is naturally sparse, AI systems face a significant challenge due to their intensive data needs.

To reduce reliance on huge data, built an autoencoder to augment and expand intentionally sparse datasets, as detailed in this paper. A computational investigation using publicly available data. Patients' ages ranging from 45 to 75 from Africa, Europe, India, and Bangladesh were included in six open-source datasets. The presented architecture uses actual patient imaging data to create synthetic pictures.

An evaluation of the glaucoma detector's performance was conducted using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Better detection performance is indicated by a higher AUC. The results demonstrate that by supplementing datasets with autoencoder-generated synthetic pictures, better training sets were produced, ultimately leading to enhanced AI model performance.

Our method avoids training with adversarial examples and instead leverages continuous learning and comprehensive threat modeling to build inherently resilient AI systems. By addressing the limitations of existing defenses and emphasizing a dynamic, adaptive strategy, our approach aims to provide a more generalized and robust solution to adversarial threats.

DL heavily relies on extensive, high-quality data to fuel its model learning and optimization processes, particularly achieving remarkable advancements in classification tasks. However, in practical applications, obtaining labeled data often faces many challenges, leading to limitations in the size of the dataset. When there is insufficient data, DL models are prone to overfitting, which is particularly prominent when dealing with small-scale datasets. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fixed dataset enhancement and classification algorithm based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This method utilizes the generation capability of GAN to generate new and diverse data samples, effectively expanding the size of the original fixed dataset and increasing its diversity. Through this approach, not only can the problem of insufficient data be alleviated, but also the performance of DL classification algorithms can be improved. The experimental results show that by introducing GAN for data augmentation, the performance of classification algorithms has been significantly improved, providing strong support for the promotion and application of DL in practical applications.",

    abstract = "Since modern life dictates human comforts, it is not surprising that the revolution of the wireless technology dominated very quickly in industrial nations, which is unlike the practical world of yore when activities required extra physical efforts to be accomplished. Nowadays, physical tasks are avoided. Therefore, it is the time to lunch quick transformations in artificial material, based on nano-scale structures and metamaterial inclusions, design to accelerate the development of modern photonic devices that have suffered from several limitations such as availability, integrability, reconfigurability, immutability, and maintainability in which the material electromagnetic specifications play the major role. This paper presents a Python implementation of a Generative-Adversarial-Network (GAN) tailored for the design and optimization of metamaterials for nano-photonics devices. The GAN consists of a generator model that produces synthetic 2D nanostructure patterns and a discriminator model that distinguishes between real and generated patterns. The goal is to generate novel designs that exhibit desirable optical properties. The code leverages TensorFlow and Keras to build and train the GAN, utilizing the MNIST dataset as a placeholder for metamaterial data. In a JupyterLab environment, the code generates and visualizes the evolving designs during training. By refining the generator through adversarial training, this approach lays the groundwork for automating the design of metamaterial-based photonic devices, reducing the need for labor-intensive trial-and-error processes and enabling rapid exploration of the design space. The implementation can be adapted to incorporate physics-based simulations for evaluating optical performance, providing a robust framework for the automated discovery of next-generation metamaterials.",

However, few studies have explored how these two technologies can be combined and their impact on tourist behavior. Additionally, considering that generative AI, as a tool for simulating tourism experiences, significantly influences tourists' perception of destinations and attractions, travel intention, travel anxiety, and willingness to pay, studying generative AI and virtual tourism seems essential and important. Therefore, this study aims to review previous research and explore the impact of AI-based virtual tourism experiences on tourist behavior in the post-COVID era. Moreover, the study investigates factors influencing the effectiveness of these experiences and the moderating role of safety and health concerns. Results also show that perceived realism and interactivity of virtual experiences are key factors in the effectiveness of these experiences.

As a result, the security protection aspect of critical infrastructure has gained more and more attention nowadays, especially the security of its industrial control system (ICS). To avoid the abnormal condition happening in the critical infrastructure which could put people in great danger, a system that is capable of detecting any abnormal state of the ICS promptly is needed. Fortunately, due to the dramatic growth of the applications of machine learning in recent years, some researchers have already proposed anomaly detection methods with machine learning to provide instant warning and protection for ICS. However, most of the existing anomaly detection research tends to only target one cause that harms the system, such as attacks on the network or physical equipment failures. The ICS will be more comprehensively secured if the anomaly detection system can cover multiple aspects of the ICS. Therefore, we have established a non-normal warning system with the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for dam operations in this study, which can detect various types of non-normal operations and notify relevant personnel right away. Note that we use real historical data to make predictions and verify our warning system, and we improve it even more by implementing the visual analysis method, which makes up the indecipherable results often found in unsupervised learning.",

This research explores the use of generative artificial intelligence (gen-AI) to create synthetic images as an alternative source in flood disaster detection and response. By adopting a systematic approach with the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm, the model is trained on gen-AI-produced synthetic images and tested using real drone-captured images from past flood events. The model demonstrates promising preliminary results with the highest performing model, achieving a mean average precision (mAP50) of 96.7\%, mAP@[0.5,0.95] of 78.7\% and an F1 score of 90.8\%.

To address this issue, this paper introduces a multi-agent communication scheme based on large language model (LLM), referred to as GPT-based semantic information extraction for multi-agent communication (GMAC). This scheme utilizes an LLM to extract semantic information and leverages the generative capabilities to predict subsequent actions, thereby enabling agents to make more informed decisions. The GMAC approach significantly reduces signaling expenditure exchanged among agents by extracting key semantic data via LLM. This method not only simplifies the communication process but also effectively reduces the communication overhead by approximately 53\% compared to the baseline methods. Experimental results indicate that GMAC not only improves the convergence speed and accuracy of decision-making but also substantially decreases the signaling expenditure among agents. Consequently, GMAC offers a straightforward and effective method to achieve efficient and economical communication in the multi-agent systems.",

    abstract = "This paper presents an innovative approach to enhancing context understanding in Generative Pretrained Models (GPTs), a critical step towards achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While GPTs have significantly advanced natural language processing, their understanding of context remains predominantly limited to linguistic structure. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel layer in the transformer model architecture that computes context weights, integrating both immediate and temporally decaying influences of past tokens. This layer is strategically positioned after the self-attention and before the feed-forward layers, enabling a more nuanced interpretation of sequential language data. Our approach involves the formulation of a decaying temporal factor, which allows the model to consider not only the immediate relevance of tokens but also their historical context. This factor is dynamically adjustable, offering a sophisticated method of context weighting that considers both current and extended contexts. The integration of this context weight into the self-attention mechanism enhances the model's capacity for a deeper, more accurate understanding of language, pushing the boundaries of current AI capabilities towards a system that mirrors human-like intelligence.

This article first presents the general factors of signal interference in power sensors, and uses optoelectronic coupling isolation measures and twisted pair shielded wire long line transmission signals to design anti-interference signal transmission channels. This article regards the monitored equipment as a dynamic linear system and establishes an anti-interference system for power sensor signals using state space equations. In response to the weak temporal and spatial correlation of data collected by each node in power sensors, the GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) algorithm is used to filter a series of power sensor nodes. In the comparison of RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and PSNR (Peak Signalto-Noise Ratio) of different algorithms, the RMSE (raw signal) of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is 0.23 and the RMSE (anti-interference signal) is 0.18. The PSNR (original signal) of GAN is 14.56, and the PSNR (anti-interference signal) is 17.89.

    abstract = "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in interior design has revolutionized how spaces are conceptualized, visualized, and classified. As digital tools and generative design models become increasingly sophisticated, distinguishing between AI-generated and real-world interior design images has emerged as a critical challenge. This classification is essential for ensuring authenticity in design visualization, improving recommendation systems, and enhancing virtual and augmented reality applications in architectural planning. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to be highly effective in image classification tasks due to their ability to learn complex spatial hierarchies, making them particularly well-suited for differentiating between AI-rendered and real interior spaces. However, recent advancements in deep learning, including hybrid AI models and transformer-based vision networks, have further enhanced classification accuracy by integrating multimodal learning techniques. This study explores the use of advanced pre-trained CNN models, including DenseNet, RegNet, and SqueezeNet architecture, to classify interior design images. By leveraging a proprietary dataset composed of diverse AI-generated and real-world interior designs, our model achieved a peak classification accuracy of 97\%, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional deep learning techniques. Additionally, we introduce a novel image preprocessing technique that enhances feature extraction by adjusting lighting, texture, and noise levels, thereby reducing discrepancies between AI-rendered and real images. The results indicate that AI approaches, CNNs, hold immense potential for further improving classification robustness. This study contributes to the growing field of AI-driven interior design classification by presenting a high-accuracy model capable of distinguishing between real and AI-generated environments with unprecedented precision.",

In this paper, we propose a generative framework for image fusion of the optical and infrared images. This framework is composed by a hierarchical generative adversarial network (GAN) including one generator and two discriminators. Different to the existing fusion method, we design a two-channel encoder for better fusion performance. Specifically, the intensity of the optical image is extracted and fed into an encoder, which is then integrated with the infrared image. In this way, the proposed framework is capable of learning the mutual knowledge between the optical and infrared images in terms of the intensity distribution. Extensive simulations on two datasets evaluate that the proposed method achieves significantly better performance than the existing approaches in terms of PSNR, RMSE and SSIM score, as well as the visualization results.",

However, its inherent random exploration mechanism leads to low efficiency, especially in complex environments where the time complexity of strategy exploration is high. To overcome this challenge, we propose a Deep Q-Learning based on the Generative Adversarial Model algorithm (DQN-GAN), aiming to improve exploration efficiency in deep reinforcement learning. The core of the DQN-GAN algorithm is to generate more diverse actions, thereby effectively simplifying the complex exploration process. Specifically, the proposed algorithm utilizes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to train a generator that generates diverse actions, enriching the exploration space. Meanwhile, a discriminator is trained with real demonstration data to ensure that the generated actions are highly consistent with actual data. Experimental data demonstrates that the integration of GAN into deep Q-learning exhibits significant performance improvements in OpenAI Gym environments. The proposed algorithm not only optimizes the exploration process but also enhances learning efficiency.",

AI in healthcare is examined through fall detection systems for vulnerable populations, the potential for data bias in personalized medical devices, and the ethical implications of off-label device use, such as continuous artificial hearts. The use of AI in witness testimonies is considered through the example of the AIWitness chatbot designed to automate witness statements. Ethical considerations surrounding facial recognition are explored in the context of airport boarding, using a hypothetical scenario based on Brighton International Airport's pilot program, FaceBoard. The project also considers self-driving taxis' ethical and practical implications, using a hypothetical scenario in San Francisco. The ecological impact of generative AI is analyzed, referencing studies from Stanford University on energy consumption and water usage for cooling systems. The ethical challenges of AI in marketing processes are addressed, including the generation of content like text, images, and voice, along with concerns about job displacement, fake content creation, and authorship issues. The use of AI in assessing historic photos is examined, focusing on selection bias, the potential for surfacing insulting content, the need for transparency, and the potential prioritization of profit over ethical considerations. Finally, the paper addresses the pervasive issue of bias in data, particularly within the field of data science. The main contribution of the paper is the development of a structured template for creating AI ethics case studies, which we already tested with smaller groups of teachers and students and refined based on their feedback.",

Employing an online survey methodology, primary data were gathered from 220 frontliners working in selected hotels in Makassar, Indonesia. The findings reveal a significant negative impact of job demands on employee well-being, underscoring the adverse effects of factors such as workload, time pressure, and emotional demands on hotel frontliners. Conversely, job resources are found to have a positive and significant influence on employee well-being, emphasizing the pivotal role of supportive factors such as autonomy, social support, and opportunities for skill development in enhancing well-being. Moreover, the study identifies generative AI as a noteworthy moderator in this context. These findings hold implications for both theoretical understanding and practical applications in human resource management within the hospitality industry. As the hospitality sector continues to integrate AI technologies, prioritizing employee well-being emerges as a critical factor in sustaining a motivated and productive workforce.",

These tools can produce striking visuals in a short amount of time and at significantly lower costs than human artists, making them accessible even to individuals with limited art skills. However, AI has also triggered debates over copyright, ethics, and the broader impact on artistic value, particularly regarding commissions and style replication. This paper offers a concise review of notable AI systems and presents qualitative insights from focus group discussions and interviews with senior Thai artists, professionals who have long served as both educators and practitioners. Although AI can aid rapid idea generation and stylistic experimentation, the participating artists emphasize the enduring importance of foundational skills–such as sketching and color theory–in achieving a genuine aesthetic. Rather than viewing AI as a threat, they acknowledge its potential to inspire creativity, yet they also stress that handmade art remains vital for cultural preservation, educational value, and personal artistic identity. By integrating these expert perspectives with established research, this study underscores both the advantages and drawbacks of AI-driven art, ultimately advocating for balanced curricula, transparent ethical guidelines, and collaborative strategies to ensure that technology supports, rather than overshadows, the human aesthetic experience.",

Instead of directly minimizing the 1-Wasserstein distance between real and generated data distributions, as in WGANs, the proposed method leverages the quantile loss to encourage the generator to produce a diverse range of outputs. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the output space of the discriminator and the gradients of fake samples to identify the root causes of mode collapse. Our study reveals that constraining the discriminator to specific values can lead to mode collapse. The proposed QR-GAN method exhibits a high level of robustness against mode collapse and significantly improves the generation performance, as measured by the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) metric, compared to other GAN variants. These findings suggest that the proposed QR-GAN method has the potential to advance the state-of-the-art in GAN research and improve their applicability in a variety of domains.",

    abstract = "The introduction and rapid adoption of particular Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as Large Language Models, where among other, Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a prominent one, have caused a significant increase in research interest for prompt engineering. Prompt engineering can be loosely described as a new emerging field where one attempts to develop particular methods, strategies, and frameworks with the main aim of organizing and structuring inputs in such a way that sophisticated AI systems can perform different tasks. These methods, techniques, and frameworks can be concepts like in-context learning, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Retrieval Augmented Generation, ReAct prompting, and Directional Stimulus Prompting. These approaches are mainly developed so users can communicate more effectively and accurately with AI language models and enable obtaining better outputs or responses tailored to queries or goals they set. As an extension and new contribution to the mentioned research field, this conceptual paper aims to introduce, propose, and theorize the notion of ‘educational promptization’. This will be done by connecting prompting to a particular social scientific practice perspective, sociomateriality. The rationale for arguing, however, is related to a need to develop an alternative research perspective to those that already dominate the mentioned research field, a research stream this conceptual paper also aims to engage with. Educational promptization is suggested as there is a demand to develop a more student-centric media literacy, especially as students and teachers engage with AI language interpreters on a daily basis. This means that the proposed educational promptization can arguably be considered to be part of a future AI literacy. An essential component of it is that one has to encompass the relational and symmetrical engagement with AI models. This is perhaps required because students will most likely be challenged to master the knowledge and skills in designing prompts, while simultaneously being capable of critically and meaningfully assessing the output of the prompts they created. In other words, mastering the complex input-and-output engagements with an AI system will be essential in students’ future learning processes.",

The framework uses large language models to interpret an analysis request, devise a solution based on ODC and AlgoHub tools, and execute the analysis. Our experimental investigations demonstrate that an LLM, with its embedded contextual knowledge, can effectively discern and sequence the necessary processing steps required to fulfill Earth observation analysis requests. This research demonstrates the potential of Generative AI (LLMs) in streamlining and enhancing EO analyses and empowering the observation community.In summary, Generative AI (LLMs) can enhance the capabilities of Earth observation analysis by automating tasks, providing natural language interfaces, and facilitating the extraction of valuable insights from the vast and complex datasets generated by remote sensing and EO technologies.",

The focus of TALIAT is to identify the most relevant elements of GAI grammar and establish how they would reflect on Learning and Teaching practices. GAIsupported systems are generally perceived beneficial as they ensure resource availability, quick and ongoing feedback, higher level of interactivity, and continued engagement. GAI tools also inculcate the ability to perform independent research through progressive and systematic probing and consequent delivery of information. Nonetheless, issues pertaining to trust, liability, transparency, honesty, fairness in judgement and trustworthy reporting of student success need to be addressed for proper adoption of GAI applications. It is being acknowledged now that various stakeholders like system developers, administrators, policymakers, psychologists, educators, sociologists, and legal experts need to work together and agree upon standards and frameworks for producing professionally, ethically, and legally acceptable GAI systems. For these stakeholders to work together, an easy to follow and adopt assessment tool needs to be designed. This would facilitate establishing methods, and processes for confidently determining impacts of GAI technologies on Learning and Teaching. The current literature has yet to provide such facilitation. Such enablement would: improve teacher's perception of, and users' confidence in, GAI systems as tools like TALIAT would assist in assessing impacts of GAI tools prior to their deployment. The proposed TALIAT could also safeguard quality of information, student competence reporting, academic culture, and social and ethical values. TALIAT projects sixteen elements of grammar on seven important aspects of GAI implications namely, handling biases, prompt tuning and evaluation, output fairness, regulatory compliance, error detection, accountability and explainability. These seven aspects are deemed important for investigating the purpose, impetuses, scope, and L\&T impact mitigation strategies of GAI applications. A set of thirty-two questions is included in TALIAT for GAI tools' impact assessment. TALIAT will be useful for the GAI stakeholders to work together as it enables informed decision making about adopting GAI systems and places rail guards for development of trustworthy GAI systems.",

    abstract = "Semantic communication (SC) leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to extract task-relevant semantic information based on specific requirements, enabling more efficient communication, which is regarded as one of the critical components for future 6G intelligent networks. Meanwhile, generative AI (GAI), a significant technological breakthrough in recent years, is renowned for its semantic extraction capabilities and data generation creativity. Inspired by this, in this paper, we explore the integration of GAI into SC, focusing on technological intersection and security risks. We begin with a comprehensive overview of SC and GAI, analyzing the current challenges. Subsequently, we elaborate on how GAI can optimize SC from multiple perspectives, including semantic extraction, data transmission, and cloud-edge deployment. In particular, we focus on security and privacy issues within the GAI-enhanced SC architecture. Finally, we validate the feasibility of our theory through a case study and outline potential directions for future research.",

In healthcare, the utilization of digital twin and data-driven models has proven to enhance clinical decision support, particularly in the treatment and assessment of chronic wounds, leading to improved clinical outcomes. This article proposes the implementation of a digital twin in the domain of healthcare, specifically in the management of chronic wounds, by leveraging artificial intelligence techniques. The digital twin is composed of data collection, data processing, and AI models dedicated to wound healing. A novel AI pipeline is utilized to track the healing of chronic wounds. The digital twin, serving as a virtual representation of the actual wound, simulates and replicates the healing process. Furthermore, the proposed wound-healing prediction model effectively guides the treatment of chronic wounds. Additionally, by comparing the actual wound with its digital twin, the system enables early identification of non-healing wounds, facilitating timely adjustments and modifications to the treatment plan. By incorporating a digital twin in healthcare, the proposed system enables personalized and tailored treatments, potentially playing a crucial role in proactive problem identification.",

This paper provides an overview of the current literature. Within the frontier AI’s crucial application in developing defense mechanisms for detecting deepfakes, we highlight the mechanisms through which generative AI based on large models (LM-based GenAI) craft seemingly convincing yet fabricated contents. We explore the multifaceted implications of LM-based GenAI on society, politics, and individual privacy violations, underscoring the urgent need for robust defense strategies. To address these challenges, in this study, we introduce an integrated framework that combines advanced detection algorithms, cross-platform collaboration, and policy-driven initiatives to mitigate the risks associated with AI-Generated Content (AIGC). By leveraging multi-modal analysis, digital watermarking, and machine learning-based authentication techniques, we propose a defense mechanism adaptable to AI capabilities of ever-evolving nature. Furthermore, the paper advocates for a global consensus on the ethical usage of GenAI and implementing cyber-wellness educational programs to enhance public awareness and resilience against m/disinformation.

However, the difficulty of object detection is exacerbated by the high proportion of small and obscure objects in the captured images. To address the mentioned challenges, we present an efficient multiband infrared small object detection approach for low-altitude intelligent surveillance services. First, we propose the multiband infrared image fusion algorithm based on cascade-GAN (MIF-CGAN), which produces fused images with high information entropy and high contrast. Then, the Transformer-based multiscale dense small object detection (MsDSOD) algorithm is proposed. The algorithm consists of the global-local object detection (G-LOD) network, the object dense area extraction (O-DAE) module, and the weighted boxes fusion (WBF) module. It extracts small objects features at different scales from infrared images and fuses the global and local detection results to accurately identify small objects in dense scenes. Furthermore, compared to the traditional algorithms, the mean average precision (mAP) of MsDSOD is improved by 0.80\% and the average precision in small object detection $({\mathrm { AP}}\_{s})$ is improved by 0.72\%. The proposed algorithm is optimally suited to deal with complex scenes with dense small objects and background occlusion.",

    abstract = "In this research-to-practice full work, we will explore how innovative educational strategies can improve students' learning experiences. Specifically, we will focus on the early development of skills in engineering students, such as numerical manipulation for problem-solving, proficient spreadsheet management, experimental implementation, and mastery of mathematical modeling complemented by informed decision-making with graphics understanding and interpretation. The effective utilization of available technological resources helps to enhance the student learning experience and prepare them for the challenges in their engineering professional practice. Physics courses often present high rates of low academic performance, but these innovative approaches can enhance active student engagement and help nurture essential skills. However, integrating technology into innovative teaching methods can have implications; one seen recently is the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (G-AI) in many instruction courses; as a technology of easy access and manipulation, it can result in a confused tool if students don't have the appropriate instruction in its use. Therefore, educating students on the ethical and proper use of AI technology is crucial, guiding them in formulating relevant questions and accurately interpreting the results. To achieve this, we used the Learning Science and Engineering with Electronic Spreadsheets Cycle (LSEESC) methodology, which has been rigorously tested across various contexts over the last four years and has shown promising results. We will support its implementation with comprehensive guidance and use Artificial Intelligence as a prompt/chat tool (e.g., Chat GPT) as a supplementary tool. This strategy aimed to help students develop effective study habits for independent study sessions and promote autonomous learning. We examine how students ask for help from AI, including their choice of words and language. We will also investigate the effects of using casual or informal language and suggest guidelines for constructing practical questions. Our goal was to assist students in obtaining a better understanding and explanations of physics concepts and problem-solving exercises with the help of AI combined with a well-defined methodology, like the LSEESC, which promotes the development of skills like numerical manipulation, mathematical modeling, variables understanding, graphics generation, interpretation, and understanding. The learning intervention considers N = 140 students for working on the LSEESC methodology and using G-AI in physics courses during spring 2024, with students in the first year of academic engineering programs. The topics to evidence the learning process are kinematics and electrics. The results were analyzed with the Normalized Conceptual Gain (NCG) given a value of <g> = 0.75 and 0.67, the Concentration Factor (CF), Rasch's index, and qualitative students' question formulation. This is particularly important because, in some instances, the results provided by G-AI were incorrect owing to the system's inability to detect specific implications that a human can easily recognize; the teacher explained the confused results presented by G-AI and student received the corresponding feedback about these issues with artificial intelligence.",

Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis (CS2) course covers extremely important knowledge and skills of becoming a computer scientist. However, students might fail to meet the learning outcomes of CS2 course, somewhat due to the abstract nature of concepts but also because of a misunderstanding of concepts, the selection of inappropriate data structure and algorithm, a lack of effective debugging skills, and writing inefficient code. Currently we are in an Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, and generative AI (also widely known as AI chatbots) are already popular across college and university campuses. Generative AI that are designed to learn and mimic human conversation is capable of generating, translating, or paraphrasing text and answering questions in a way that is often indistinguishable from human-generated content. We investigate the above-mentioned potential challenges faced by students while learning CS2 course at Oklahoma State University (OSU) and redesign the course homework in Fall 2023 semester. The objectives of the redesigned course homework are to provide students with opportunities to use generative AI to support their learning in the CS2 course as well as measure the effectiveness of utilizing generative AI to improve student learning outcomes in the CS2 course. At the end of Fall 2023 semester, we conducted a student perception survey in the CS2 course and collected valuable feedback from 47 out of 61 students (77\% response rate). In summary, 85.1\%, 76.6\%, 74.5\%, 63.8\%, and 70.2\% respondents indicated that generative AI help to understand testing and debugging better, improve coding skills and code quality, design and implement efficient data structures and algorithms, select appropriate algorithms and data structures with the assistance of generative AI, and under-stand the importance of designing and implementing efficient data structures and algorithms, respectively. In this paper, we summarize the experience of redesigning CS2 course homework at OSU, share lessons learned, and provide candid suggestions for utilizing course homework in CS2 courses at other institutions.",

Marketing can be enhanced by the use of advanced model AI in generating more profound approaches that can be adopted in creating marketing material in order to take up a business a notch higher. Thus, this paper aims at proposing a new method that complements the use of GPT-4 and Variational Autoencoders (VAE) in generating good business content and synthetic data as compared to conventional approaches. The applied in this paper is a python-based methodology that comprises of data collection process which involves Kaggle datasets encompassing market trends, customer behavior, and competitors analysis. Specifically, web scraping and data augmentation are used in preprocessing with the help of BeautifulSoup, Scrapy as well as SMOTE to improve the quality and variability of the dataset. Feature engineering employs PCA and TF-IDF to select and transform the features for improving the decision boundary of the dataset and to obtain the textual patterns. The GPT-4 model is used for the generation of contextualised and business relevant text, which helps the VAEs in the creation of synthetic data that improves the models capability in data sparse situations and for various business scenarios. The procedure of fine-tuning of the parameters of the model to enhance accuracy and relevance of the AI generated outputs is known as Bayesian Optimization. The suggested approach performs better than the existing literature including better BLEU scores, cross-validation accuracy, and runs faster. Essentially, this research offers a strong basis for employing generative AI in business while presenting notable improvements over prior models and improving business strategy implementation.",

In this paper, the algorithms of Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost, Linear Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used for the classification and prediction of course success. Among these, the most accurate performance, quantified for example by R2 score, Mean Absolute Error and Mean Squared Error, was given by RF, with a probability of being correct at 83.81\%. The results indicate that midterm exams have a significantly stronger influence on predicting course success, while short quizzes play an important role in maintaining consistent student engagement and reinforcing foundational concepts.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a key component of this change, and it can assist doctors with various healthcare systems and intelligent health systems. AI is crucial in diagnosing common diseases, developing new medications, and analyzing patient information from electronic health records. However, one of the main issues with adopting AI in healthcare is the lack of transparency, as doctors must interpret the output of the AI. Explainable AI (XAI) is extremely important for the healthcare sector and comes into play in this regard. With XAI, doctors, patients, and other stakeholders can more easily examine a decision's reliability by knowing its reasoning due to XAI's interpretable explanations. Deep learning is used in this study to discuss explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in medical image analysis. The primary goal of this paper is to provide a generic six-category XAI architecture for classifying DL-based medical image analysis and interpretability methods.The interpretability method/XAI approach for medical image analysis is often categorized based on the explanation and technical method. In XAI approaches, the explanation method is further sub-categorized into three types: text-based, visual-based, and examples-based.

Digital pathology comprises the digitalization of Histopathological slides using a Whole-slide scanner which is a microscope under robotic and computer control and analysing these digitalized images or whole-slide image using a Computational approach. This digitalization creates a high-resolution, enhanced pixel image of pathological specimen that ultimately generates a tremendous amount of data up to gigabytes per biopsy. Because of algorithmic advancement and more convenient computing power, in the past few decades, Artificial Intelligence and machine learning have spread their roots into healthcare and clinical applications.

Subsequently, ChatGPT became available in November 2022, and the various potential applications of ChatGPT and other generative AIs and the associated risks have attracted attention. In this study, we examined how the emergence of generative AI affects the relationship between AI and security. The results show that (a) the need for the four perspectives of AI and security remains unchanged in the era of generative AI, (b) The generalization of AI targets and automatic program generation with the birth of generative AI will greatly increase the risk of attacks by the AI itself, (c) The birth of generative AI will make it possible to generate easy-to-understand answers to various questions in natural language, which may lead to the spread of fake news and phishing e-mails that can easily fool many people and an increase in AI-based attacks. In addition, it became clear that (1) attacks using AI and (2) responses to attacks by AI itself are highly important. Among these, the analysis of attacks by AI itself, using an attack tree, revealed that the following measures are needed: (a) establishment of penalties for developing inappropriate programs, (b) introduction of a reporting system for signs of attacks by AI, (c) measures to prevent AI revolt by incorporating Asimov's three principles of robotics, and (d) establishment of a mechanism to prevent AI from attacking humans even when it becomes confused.",

Brain signals, serving as potential reflections of how the brain interprets external information, exhibit a distinctive one-to-many correspondence with various external modalities. This correspondence makes brain signals emerge as a promising guiding condition for multimodal synthesis (e.g., image, text, and audio), which is crucial for developing practical brain–computer interface systems and unraveling complex mechanisms underlying human perception. This survey comprehensively examines the emerging field of brain-conditional multimodal synthesis, termed AIGC-brain, to delineate the current landscape and future directions. To begin, related neuroimaging datasets and generative models are introduced as the foundation of AIGC-brain decoding and analysis. Next, we present a comprehensive taxonomy according to AIGC-brain methodologies, followed by task-specific representative work and implementation details to facilitate in-depth comparison and analysis. Quality assessments are then introduced for both qualitative and quantitative evaluation. Finally, this survey explores insights gained, outlining current challenges and prospects of AIGC-brain. As a pioneering survey, this article paves the way for future advances in AIGC-brain research.",

Aiming at the characteristics and complex correlation of high dimensional telemetry data, this paper proposes a novel anomaly detection method based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for telemetry data anomaly detection. Instead of treating each variable independently, our proposed method captures the latent representation amongst multi-dimensional time series. For normal data, the GAN-based anomaly detection method can obtain a reconstructed time series similar to the original time series, learning the probability distribution model of normal data. For abnormal data, the reconstructed time series deviates greatly from the original time series. In the GAN framework, we use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as the network structure of generator for time series reconstruction and discriminator for calculating the probability of being the real time series, which can learn the temporal features of telemetry data. We also propose a novel anomaly score called GDScore, which comprehensively considers the reconstruction error of the generator and the output of the discriminator. We conduct experiments with two telemetry datasets, which verifies that our proposed GAN-based anomaly detection method can effectively detect outliers.",

On the hand G aims to understand the underlying distribution of the data. By training G to maximize the likelihood of D making mistakes a competitive environment is established. There are applications for G and D but one particularly notable solution emerges. D consistently evaluates any input as if it came from training data while G effectively captures the details of that training data distribution. Notably this system can be trained using known techniques like backpropagation when implementing G and D as multilayer perceptrons. This eliminates the need for inference networks or intricate Markov chains, during both training and sample generation processes. Thorough evaluations of the generated samples confirm the potential of this framework as demonstrated through testing. This innovative approach offers an efficient means to capture data distributions, which could potentially revolutionize generative modeling.",

The CGAN not only learns to represent channel effects through feature extraction but also facilitates gradient back-propagation between the receiver and the transmitter, thereby enhancing the system's adaptability. This paper extends the CGAN-based end-to-end system from single input single output channels to multiple input multiple output (MIMO) scenarios.

Our loss function combines pixel-wise, perceptual, and adversarial losses to simultaneously optimize fidelity and realism.

Nevertheless, owing to the unique complexity of the underwater environment, captured underwater images often face the challenge of information loss, manifested as blurry images, low signal - to - noise ratios, and poor color quality. These issues significantly limit the effective utilization and value of high - quality underwater images in scientific research and engineering practices. Currently, common problems in the field of underwater image enhancement research include high algorithm complexity and insufficient feature extraction capabilities. Therefore, to address the problems of insufficient feature extraction of the target information under test, we adopted the generative adversarial network (GAN) as the main architecture and incorporated an attention mechanism into the network generator. This enables us to centre around the key information of the image during feature extraction, resulting in clearer images.

The network first extracts and strengthens local and global features in the image through a feature enhancement module, effectively solving the problem that traditional dehazing methods cannot fully capture image details and global semantic information. Then, channel attention and coordinate attention are introduced to process the dense fog area and high-frequency area of the image from different angles. Finally, a multi-scale fusion module is designed to replace the original ordinary feature splicing operation and enhance the detail fidelity of the image.In the discriminator part, a fusion discriminator (FDG-D) is constructed to enhance the ability to distinguish the source of the image by introducing the high-frequency and low-frequency information of the image as additional priors.

The overall network architecture consists of two sub-networks, i.e., a semantic preserving generative adversarial network module and a discriminative hashing module. The generator maps text features into the image feature space. And the discriminator judges whether the feature representations are real image features or generated image features. The adversarial learning process can effectively reduce modality difference and preserve information of the image modality as much as possible. The discriminative hashing module projects the real and generated image features into a Hamming space to obtain hash codes, and explores semantic similarities for enhancing the discriminant ability of hash codes. Experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate that SPGAN can outperform state-of-the-art related works.",

This exploratory study hypothesizes that enhancing the mental health of AI systems can mitigate energy consumption. By drawing parallels between AI challenges, such as attention scatter, computational dyscalculia, and overfitting-and human mental disorders, we seek to develop novel strategies for optimizing AI efficiency. We propose that incorporating psychiatric expertise during AI training and development could steer models towards more energy-efficient operations, potentially revolutionizing training methodologies in the forthcoming years. These AI-related issues contribute to operational inefficiencies, prompting frequent algorithmic adjustments and heightened computational resource demands. Improving the management of these challenges within AI could reduce errors and redundant processes, refine decision-making, and lessen the necessity for retraining. We assessed the environmental impact of Gen-AI, focusing on energy expenditures during training and inference phases. For instance, training models like GPT-3 reportedly consume approximately 1,287 megawatt-hours, with ongoing inference contributing to even higher emissions. We contend that enhancing AI mental health and utilizing algorithms such as CarbonMin-which allocate computational tasks to regions with lower carbon footprints-can significantly reduce emissions by an estimated 35\% currently and up to 71\% by 2035. Advancements in hardware and software efficiencies could further diminish the carbon footprint by as much as a thousandfold compared to traditional models. This preliminary research suggests that integrating psychiatric principles into AI development could optimize performance and substantially lower energy consumption and carbon emissions, unveiling new avenues for future investigation.",

    abstract = "Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can significantly improve cyber security operations if tasks and responsibilities are effectively shared between human and machine. AI techniques excel in some situational understanding tasks; for instance, classifying intrusions. However, existing AI systems are often overconfident in their classification: this reduces the trust of human analysts. Furthermore, sophisticated intrusions span across long time periods to reduce their footprint, and each decision to respond to a (suspected) attack can have unintended side effects. In this position paper we show how advanced AI systems handling uncertainty and encompassing expert knowledge can lessen the burden on human analysts. In detail: (1) Effective interaction with the analyst is a key issue for the success of an intelligence support system. This involves two issues: a clear and unambiguous system-analyst communication, only possible if both share the same domain ontology and conceptual framework, and effective interaction, allowing the analyst to query the system for justifications of the reasoning path followed and the results obtained. (2) Uncertainty-aware machine learning and reasoning is an effective method for anomaly detection, which can provide human operators with alternative interpretations of data with an accurate assessment of their confidence. This can contribute to reducing misunderstandings and building trust. (3) An event-processing algorithm including both a neural and a symbolic layer can help identify attacks spanning long intervals of time, that would remain undetected via a pure neural approach.

    abstract = "With the growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into higher education, learners’ trust in AI systems has attracted increasing attention. This meta-analysis synthesized 78 independent effect sizes from 42 empirical studies (N = 28,970) to examine key antecedents and consequences of AI trust. Four categories of antecedents were assessed: technological performance, user experience, ethics and safety, and sociodemographic and individual differences. Trust in AI was also analyzed in relation to behavioral intention to use, learning outcomes, and AI acceptance. Results showed that technological performance was the strongest predictor of trust, followed by user experience and individual differences, while ethics and safety had a relatively weaker impact. Trust in AI significantly predicted all three outcomes, underscoring its mediating role. Moderator analyses revealed that high-level feedback enhanced the effects of technological performance and ethics on trust, and that trust was generally higher in learning-support tasks than in academic writing tasks. These findings offer theoretical and practical insights for optimizing educational AI design and promoting adaptive, trustworthy systems.",

Taking this into account, the efficient management and orchestration of both telecommunication and computational resources across the network domains, i.e. access, transport and core presents a considerable challenge, even for network experts. To tackle this complexity, this paper explores the implementation of an intent-based management framework. The framework receives a high-level description of the desired network capabilities along with supplementary files, e.g. deployment descriptors, and translates them into configuration files consumable by the network itself. In order to achieve this, the paper establishes a translation pipeline that leverages the employment of emerging multimodal generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), and open industry-ready standard templates. The adoption of those two emerging technologies offers high dynamicity on the interpretation process of the user’s intent, while ensuring that its outcome is compatible with every orchestrator or next-generation Operating Support System (Next-gen OSS) that adheres to those standards.",

In response, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has emerged as a promising solution, equipping EI to produce diverse Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) for ubiquitous edge services. However, existing cloud-based GAI capabilities, which are mostly provided via the web and the Internet, introduce unacceptable latency overhead and heightened security risks for vehicular services. To address the above shortcomings and the lack of endogenous mechanisms for applying GAI to IoV scenarios, in this paper, we propose a layered vehicular GAI framework that seamlessly integrates GAI and EI. Within this framework, we devise a distributed collaborative inference mechanism between Road-Side Units (RSUs) and vehicles. Furthermore, we formulate the shared and local inference splitting problem, a pivotal challenge influencing both GAI service latency and content-generation capability. To tackle this issue, we introduce a backward induction-based algorithm, which enables the system can make splitting decisions using a simple threshold-based policy. Simulation results underscore the remarkable performance of the proposed system and vehicular collaborative inference mechanism, promising to facilitate diverse content generation within vehicular networks.",

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel HIF diagnosis method based on conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WCGAN). By adversarial training, WCGAN can generate sufficient labeled zero-sequence current signals, which can expand the limited training set and achieve the balanced distribution of the samples. In addition, the Wasserstein distance was introduced to improve the loss function.

To improve the generating ability of GANs, various loss functions are introduced to measure the degree of similarity between the samples generated by the generator and the real data samples, and the effectiveness of the loss functions in improving the generating ability of GANs. In this paper, we present a detailed survey for the loss functions used in GANs, and provide a critical analysis on the pros and cons of these loss functions. First, the basic theory of GANs along with the training mechanism are introduced. Then, the most commonly used loss functions in GANs are introduced and analyzed. Third, the experimental analyses and comparison of these loss functions are presented in different GAN architectures. Finally, several suggestions on choosing suitable loss functions for image synthesis tasks are given.",

    abstract = "Artificial intelligence (AI) trends vary significantly across global regions, shaping the trajectory of innovation, regulation, and societal impact. This variation influences how different regions approach AI development, balancing technological progress with ethical and regulatory considerations. This study conducts a comparative analysis of AI trends in the United States (US), the European Union (EU), and Asia, focusing on three key dimensions: generative AI, ethical oversight, and industrial applications. The US prioritizes market-driven innovation with minimal regulatory constraints, the EU enforces a precautionary risk-based framework emphasizing ethical safeguards, and Asia employs state-guided AI strategies that balance rapid deployment with regulatory oversight. Although these approaches reflect different economic models and policy priorities, their divergence poses challenges to international collaboration, regulatory harmonization, and the development of global AI standards. To address these challenges, this paper synthesizes regional strengths to propose an adaptive AI governance framework that integrates risk-tiered oversight, innovation accelerators, and strategic alignment mechanisms. By bridging governance gaps, this study offers actionable insights for fostering responsible AI development while ensuring a balance between technological progress, ethical imperatives, and regulatory coherence.",

    abstract = "Limited operating data resulting from complex and changeable working conditions significantly undermines the performance of deep learning-based methods for rolling bearing fault diagnosis. Generally, this problem can be solved by using the generative adversarial network (GAN) to augment data. Most GAN-based methods, however, seldom comprehensively consider the global interactions and local dependencies in raw vibration signals during data generation, leading to a decline in the quality of the generated data and compromising the diagnostic accuracy. To address this problem, a fault diagnosis method based on integrated convolutional transformer GAN (ICoT-GAN) is proposed to improve the diagnostic performance under limited data conditions by generating high-quality signals. First, a new data augmentation model ICoT-GAN is developed. In ICoT-GAN, a novel ICoT block is designed to construct the generator and discriminator. The ICoT block achieves the integration of attention-based global information capture and convolution-based local feature extraction through the incorporation of convolution within the transformer encoder. This design allows the ICoT-GAN to comprehensively extract both global and local time-series features of raw signals and generate high-quality signals. Second, a novel data evaluation indicator, referred to as the multiple time-domain features indicator (MTFI), is designed to quantitatively evaluate generated signals’ quality by calculating the similarity of time-domain features between the real and generated signals. The MTFI can complement probability distribution indicators and provide a comprehensive evaluation of the data augmentation model’s generation ability by considering both time-series feature similarity and probability distribution differences. Finally, the effectiveness of our proposed method has been successfully demonstrated under limited data conditions using the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and Center for Intelligent Maintenance System (IMS) bearing datasets. With only 16 training samples per class, our proposed method achieves diagnostic accuracy of 99.99\% and 99.70\%, respectively. Additionally, the data generation time is only 1163.31 s, indicating the efficiency of our proposed method.",

It should also be remembered that the exam is a time to learn, not just a time to check what has been learnt. Based on these approaches, an analysis of the use of generative AI applications and tools in engineering education was carried out on the subject of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC).

The method allows for the creation of parts to be completed in a shorter time frame and has the objective of achieving multiple sustainability goals with minimal information provided at the outset. This article will present a practical case study of this method on an automotive Engine mounting bracket, a complex part that must meet a range of requirements, including those related to rigidity, strength; and sustainability. The initial 3D model will define the space constraints (design space), operating conditions, and objectives to be achieved. These may include, for example, improvements in rigidity, lightweighting and fatigue, reductions in CO2 impact, and improvements in autonomy. The result is a set of designs that respect the constraints and maximize the objectives. Subsequently, the designer may select the design that is most aligned with their preferences, taking into account additional considerations such as manufacturing simplicity, or cost. A comparative analysis was conducted between generative design and traditional design, which relies on human expertise, CAD (computer-aided design) tools, and algorithms. The weight, deformation, stress, fatigue, CO2 emissions and self-sufficiency performance of the two methods were evaluated. It was found that generative design allows for a 30\% reduction in the weight of the part compared to traditional design, while simultaneously improving its rigidity and strength. The total weight reduction of many brackets for the same vehicle also results in a decrease in CO2 by 3.5 g/km and an increase in autonomy by 2.8 km.",

The internal generative mechanism (IGM) indicates that the HVS actively infers the primary content (i.e., meaningful information) of an image for better understanding. Inspired by that, this paper presents a novel BIQA metric by mimicking the active inference process of IGM. Firstly, an active inference module based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) is established to predict the primary content, in which the semantic similarity and the structural dissimilarity (i.e., semantic consistency and structural completeness) are both considered during the optimization. Then, the image quality is measured on the basis of its primary content. Generally, the image quality is highly related to three aspects, i.e., the scene information (content-dependency), the distortion type (distortion-dependency), and the content degradation (degradation-dependency). According to the correlation between the distorted image and its primary content, the three aspects are analyzed and calculated respectively with a multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) based quality evaluator. As a result, with the help of the primary content obtained from the active inference and the comprehensive quality degradation measurement from the multi-stream CNN, our method achieves competitive performance on five popular IQA databases. Especially in cross-database evaluations, our method achieves significant improvements.",

Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to AI systems, with backdoor attacks emerging as a potent form of attack. Consequently, it becomes imperative to focus research efforts on mitigating discrimination and bias in AI models, emphasising ethical considerations and model interpretability. Adversarial machine learning (AML) is a critical field within AI that specifically addresses the vulnerabilities and countermeasures associated with the manipulation and subversion of machine learning models by adversarial actors. Previous research on AML focused on model vulnerabilities, attacks, and defences.

    abstract = "In-vehicle controller area network (CAN) is susceptible to various cyberattacks due to its broadcast-based communication nature. An attacker can inject false messages to a vehicle’s CAN via wireless communication, the infotainment system, or the onboard diagnostic port. Thus, an effective intrusion detection system is essential to distinguish authentic CAN messages from false ones. In this study, we developed a hybrid quantum-classical CAN intrusion detection framework using a classical neural network (NN) and a quantum restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). The classical NN is dedicated to feature extraction from CAN images generated from a vehicle’s CAN bus data. In contrast, the quantum RBM is dedicated to CAN image reconstruction for classification-based intrusion detection. The novelty of the study lies in utilizing the generative ability of an RBM to reconstruct the pixels in a CAN image, a portion of which is dedicated to labeling. Then, that portion of the reconstructed image is used to classify the image as an attack image or a normal image. To evaluate the performance of the hybrid quantum-classical CAN intrusion detection framework, we used a real-world CAN fuzzy attack dataset to create three separate attack datasets, where each dataset represents a unique set of features related to the vehicle. We compared the performance of our hybrid framework to a similar but classical-only framework. Our analyses showed that the hybrid framework performs better in CAN intrusion detection compared to the classical-only framework. For the three datasets considered in this study, the best models in the hybrid framework achieved 97.5\%, 97\%, and 98.3\% intrusion detection accuracies and 94.7\%, 93.9\%, and 97.2\% recalls, respectively. In contrast, the best models in the classical-only framework achieved 92.5\%, 95\%, and 93.3\% intrusion detection accuracies and 84.2\%, 89.8\%, and 88.9\% recalls, respectively.",

Emotion analysis showed that negative emotions dominated at 58.46\%, including anger (22.85\%) and disgust (17.26\%). Sentiment analysis echoed this negativity, with 70\% negative. The triangulation of thematic, emotional, and sentiment analyses highlighted a polarized public stance: recognition of GenAI's transformative potential is tempered by significant concerns about its implications. The findings offer actionable insights for engineering managers and policymakers.

It is an unsupervised learning framework that involves automatically learning a model from input data to produce a synthetic output that closely resembles the original input. GANs create datasets by making copies of false outputs based on specific inputs. GANs allow machines to generate unique content that is different from human-generated data. GANs are widely used in various image-related fields, such as image-to-text conversion, next-generation faces, high-resolution image conversion, etc. The general growth of artificial intelligence and its medical applications is increasing the efficiency of the healthcare system for patients who need rapid care. Chronic diseases, especially stroke, are now the leading cause of death worldwide. Diagnosis of stroke is often based on imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, CT scans are more common and readily available in many African hospitals, especially in Senegal. However, the need for rapid image interpretation of stroke is sometimes problematic due to variable image quality, highlighting the need for improvements to achieve better image quality. This article focuses on improving the resolution of CT images, a commonly used method in medical imaging. However, obtaining a high-quality CT scan often requires lengthy wait times and the use of limited laboratory equipment. In addition, radioactive radiation poses health risks and results in poorer image quality. Super-resolution GAN has the potential to solve this problem. Super-resolution is a method of generating high-resolution images from low-resolution images. We use the input CT dataset to generate higher quality images while keeping parameters unchanged. We found that using ResNet with GANs produced higher quality images than the original input images.",

However, the possibility of hallucinations prevents their adoption of risk-sensitive applications, such as generating materials for communicating climate change. To demonstrate this issue, we train a generative adversarial network (GAN, pix2pixHD) to create synthetic satellite imagery of future flooding and reforestation events. We find that a pure deep learning-based model can generate photorealistic flood visualizations but hallucinate floods at locations that are not susceptible to flooding. To address this issue, we propose to condition and evaluate generative vision models on segmentation maps of physics-based flood models.

However, few studies have investigated the transformative impact of GAI on business operations, with a specific focus on research and development (R\&D) and advertising facilitated by AI-generated content (AIGC) empowerment; particularly, there is a lack of analysis on the impact of AIGC iteration on firms’ decision-making. The study uses the optimal control and learning-by-doing method to examine two types of AIGC strategies, the single AIGC (enhancing R\&D exclusively) and the dual AIGC (simultaneously boosting R\&D and advertising), to delve into their dynamic iteration effects on firms’ performance. Our findings reveal that, under the single AIGC strategy, focusing on investments in the AI training R\&D sector alone can enhance the GAI smartness level more effectively than adopting the dual AIGC strategy. Conversely, under the dual AIGC strategy, firms initially tend to select GAI empowerment toward the downstream advertising sector more than the upstream R\&D sector. Both strategies demonstrate enhanced profits and increased demand with higher rates of AIGC self-learning. Notably, considering the limited budget, firms prioritize allocating AI training resources to the R\&D sector under the dual AIGC strategy, guaranteeing their long-term success.",

    abstract = "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are increasingly being explored and used for a variety of classification tasks in medical imaging, but current methods for post hoc explainability are limited. Most commonly used methods highlight portions of the input image that contribute to classification. While this provides a form of spatial localization relevant for focal disease processes, it may not be sufficient for co-localized or diffuse disease processes such as pulmonary edema or fibrosis. For the latter, new methods are required to isolate diffuse texture features employed by the CNN where localization alone is ambiguous. We therefore propose a novel strategy for eliciting explainability, called Feature Interpretation using Generative Adversarial Networks (FIGAN), which provides visualization of features used by a CNN for classification or regression. FIGAN uses a conditional generative adversarial network to synthesize images that span the range of a CNN’s principal embedded features. We apply FIGAN to two previously developed CNNs and show that the resulting feature interpretations can clarify ambiguities within attention areas highlighted by existing explainability methods. In addition, we perform a series of experiments to study the effect of auxiliary segmentations, training sample size, and image resolution on FIGAN’s ability to provide consistent and interpretable synthetic images.",

The findings highlight the role of AI in revolutionizing pedagogy, enhancing student engagement, and optimizing administrative workflows. Educators reported improvements in teaching strategies driven by AI-powered adaptive learning platforms and AI-generated resources, which enable personalized and dynamic learning experiences. However, the research also revealed key challenges, such as resistance to AI adoption, concerns over data privacy, and infrastructure limitations that hinder effective integration. A cross-case analysis emphasized the evolving role of educators, highlighting shifts in teacher-student dynamics and potential increases in job satisfaction, tempered by new responsibilities. While students benefit from personalized learning paths, they also face hurdles related to digital literacy and unequal access to AI-driven resources. Ethical considerations around AI deployment emerged as critical, underscoring the need for clear guidelines and strong policies. The study concludes by offering recommendations for educational institutions, policymakers, and AI developers to collaborate in fostering an innovative, inclusive, and ethically responsible educational landscape.

    abstract = "Whilst the task of creating music sequences through artificial intelligence has been met with a lot of attention, current approaches tend to stumble when it comes to capturing rich structures and subtle detail in musical compositions. Conventional models lack the capacity to build temporal dependencies as well as incorporate condition mechanisms (such as genre or mood), counteracting in less-ideal generation quality. In this work we address the above limitations and propose a hybrid model incorporating Dynamic Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) [15] and Generative Adversarial Network for music sequence generation from MIDI files. Our proposed approach utilizes a piano-roll representation and an event-based encoding for pre-processing, retaining structural as well as temporal complexities of music samples at the level of events. Meanwhile, the CVAE part (in a Seq2Seq architecture) is introduced to model conditioned latent distribution over music sequence attributes such as genre or composer identity in order contribute both generation and reconstruction of realistic musical samples. Furthermore, a Conditional GAN (cGAN) along with Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) is utilized for generating sequences of better quality by creating more realistic and conditionally plausible music samples. The results we show demonstrate that this hybrid CVAE-GAN framework can not only significantly improve the quality of generated music sequences (in terms like FAD) but also allow for a better listening experience, outperforming state-of-the-art evaluation methods. The work sets up a potential future in which AI helps musicians compose more nuanced music that is almost indistinguishable from the product of human creativity.",

Traditional visual image generation technologies struggle to meet these demands, particularly in terms of detail representation, semantic consistency, and the efficiency of image generation. In this study, we propose a method based on a Dynamic Attention-enhanced Generative Adversarial Network (DA-GAN). By constructing a network architecture that includes a progressive upsampling generator embedded with a CBAM module and a discriminator combining PatchGAN with global average pooling, we optimize the model using an improved Wasserstein GAN adversarial loss, a perceptual loss based on a pre-trained VGG-19 model, and a style loss calculated via the Gram matrix. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to methods such as StyleGAN2 and SAGAN, DA-GAN achieves significant improvements in metrics like PSNR and SSIM, exhibits a lower FID value, and generates images with richer details and stronger semantic consistency. Additionally, DA-GAN offers notable advantages in computational efficiency and exhibits lower growth in memory consumption. This study provides an effective solution to the challenges faced by traditional visual image generation technologies in detail representation, semantic consistency, and generation efficiency, with broad application prospects.",

    abstract = "Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way programming is taught and learnt and is redefining t he way programming skills are assessed in the continuously changing field of computer science education. This paper introduces a novel approach for teaching and evaluating programming knowledge by reversing Bloom's taxonomy in order to accommodate AI-powered learning. Traditionally, Bloom's taxonomy progresses from basic cognitive skills like remembering and understanding to advanced skills like creating. With AI tools such as WebSim.ai and Anthropic Artifacts now capable of generating sophisticated outputs, the focus shifts away from students' ability to create, as these tools handle that task effectively. Instead, this paper proposes placing a higher emphasis on students' ability to understand and critically analyze AI -generated solutions, assessing their comprehension and ability to reverse-engineer existing work. We call this the Reverse Bloom Taxonomy, where students begin with creation and then move toward deeper understanding of the subject matter. This paper outlines the methodology for applying this reversed framework in programming education and presents a promising concept for improving student learning outcomes. The discussion addresses challenges in implementation and emphasizes the strategic integration of AI -driven learning to prepare students for a technology-driven workforce.",

However, current semantic systems suffer from black-box decision-making, while existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods face two key challenges: explicability granularity mismatch and closed-loop optimization gap. To address these, we propose a semantic communication framework integrated with XAI (XAI-SCS). Specifically, we first design an explainable semantic codec architecture enhanced by Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KAN), where traditional fixed activation functions are replaced with learnable and parameterized ones, enabling function-level visualization to improve model explainability. Second, we develop an explainable semantic transmission module driven by contrastive learning that enhances the robustness of semantic transmission, and incorporating a semantic separability metric to quantify channel impacts on semantic integrity. Third, we introduced a KAN-enhanced causal semantic decoder, which integrates counterfactual interventions to generate pixel-level difference maps. We also propose a contrastive explanation consistency metric to evaluate the sensitivity of key features, enhancing the quality of the reconstruction. The experimental results show that our approaches enhance explainability across the entire decision process, achieve a significant accuracy improvement of up to 55\% on the CIFAR-10 dataset with a bandwidth compression ratio of 1/25, and also obtain competitive image reconstruction quality in increasing compression levels.

    abstract = "In the wave of technological innovation, generative artificial intelligence tools provide college students with personalized learning experience, promote autonomous learning and exploratory learning, and improve learning outcomes through intelligent tutoring and instant feedback. However, existing research shows that generative artificial intelligence tools still face multiple obstacles in practical application, such as differences in students' acceptance of new technologies, privacy protection challenges, and difficulties in integrating with the existing education system. This study is based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), a technology acceptance model, and specifically introduces perceived risk as a moderating variable. Combining key factors such as college students' cognitive characteristics and technological environment, this study constructs a theoretical model that affects college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools.The study found that performance expectations, effort expectations, social influence, and convenience conditions have a significant positive impact on college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools; effort expectations have a positive impact on performance expectations; convenience conditions have a positive impact on effort expectations; effort expectations mediate the relationship between convenience conditions and willingness to use; and perceived risk negatively moderates the impact of convenience conditions on willingness to use. It is expected that through this empirical study, the key factors that affect college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools will be deeply explored, and valuable suggestions and references will be provided for guiding technology optimization and education integration practices, which will help develop generative artificial intelligence tools that better meet the needs of college students and promote innovation and improvement of online education models.",

    abstract = "Before CNN, image recognition methods mainly relied on artificial design features, which can only represent the medium and low-level information in the image, and it is difficult to extract the deep-level information of the image. CNN simulates the human brain by establishing a deep neural network to analyze, learn and interpret data. It has strong expression ability and generalization ability, and can better represent the deep-seated information of images. At present, CNN has been widely used in many scenes, including image classification, speech recognition, video analysis, document analysis and so on. Most of the existing artificial intelligence image recognition systems are implemented by software and often accelerated by GPU. However, GPU has high power consumption and is not suitable for CNN reasoning, so it can not make use of the parallel computing power of CNN. To solve the above problems, this paper studies the application method of CNN image recognition acceleration and Optimization Based on FPGA, designs and optimizes the CNN forward model by using Intel FPGA board. The experimental results show that FPGA has low power consumption, the power consumption of CPU is 2.1 times, while the power consumption of GPU is 6.5 times. The average recognition time of the algorithm is 50\% shorter than that of Lenet-5,AlexNet and VGG16, and the recognition time of 10000 sample pictures is 165μs. Compared with 426.6μs required by DSP chip system. Compared with the methods proposed in the literature in related fields in recent years, the proposed method has higher throughput and computational performance.",

To address these concerns, various AI text detection software tools have been developed to evaluate whether a text is AI generated or human generated. The aim of this research is to empirically examine the accuracy of AI detection tools in identifying AI-generated texts. An experiment was conducted using textual data generated by ChatGPT, which was assessed using Turnitin and four other AI detection tools. Through multiple iterations and interventions, the text was paraphrased by ChatGPT until it appeared original and could not be detected as AI-generated by Turnitin’s AI detection tool. The findings revealed that all the AI detection software tools that were examined failed to detect the AI-generated text by ChatGPT in the final iteration. The findings provide valuable insights that have implications for various stakeholders, including educators, researchers, and AI text detection software developers. Based on the tools examined, educators and researchers do not need to set a specific threshold or percentage, including 0\%, to determine what qualifies as acceptable AI-generated text. This is because establishing such a threshold can be misleading, considering the current limitations in the algorithms of these tools. Furthermore, the data generated in this paper can provide a solid basis for replicated research or software testing and assessment. It can be utilized to evaluate the accuracy of alternative AI detection tools and any future advancements in the tools mentioned in this investigation.",

These attacks often employ gradient matching strategy to align the gradients of the reconstructed dummy data with the real data, thereby bringing the dummy images look similar to the actual private images. However, due to the inherent characteristic of high dimensional search space, directly optimizing the dummy images is easy to cause reconstruction failure. In addition, the quality of restored images is significantly sensitive to the data initialization method. Therefore, in this paper, we would like to introduce a novel generative gradient inversion, named GGI, attack algorithm where the dummy images are generated on low-dimensional latent vectors through a pre-trained generator. Compared to the common entire data reconstruction, optimizing the random vectors dramatically reduce the dimension of search space. Our empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively enhance the quality of restored images.",

Artificial intelligence (AI) has played a crucial role in advancing technical development throughout many areas. Evidence points toward the likelihood of major developmental breakthroughs unfolding soon in those sectors. Education is one such area. While there is certainly a possibility for hype and unfulfilled promises, the advent of available GAI platforms, such as ChatGPT, has caused a surge of scholarly interest in the impact of these technologies on CS education. Amid the growing debate, both the potential benefits and concerns of GAI in this sector are increasingly coming to the fore as people grapple with the tradeoffs associated with these technologies when applied in education settings. One can imagine the range of conversations around the topic, but that is difficult to use as input for policymakers and administrators without a more concrete understanding. To wit, there remain open questions about which benefits and concerns people tend to focus on when discussing GAI in education. This large-scale qualitative study addresses that gap by exploring the public's perspectives on GAI in CS education. We engage in this work by collecting and analyzing data from social media platforms, specifically Reddit comments. The social media dataset was analyzed using machine learning (ML) techniques to identify topics based on sentiment analysis. The study's objective was to document and characterize the public's perspectives concerning the general characteristics of GAI, its features related to learning, and its usability in educational settings. Through sentiment analysis using Large Language Models (LLM), the study revealed an overall positive public perception toward using generative AI in CS education, with over 57\% of comments being favorable, while also identifying prominent topics of interest and concerns, such as the potential benefits of personalized learning support and automated grading, as well as issues like academic dishonesty, perpetuation of biases, over-reliance on AI hindering critical thinking, displacement of human instructors, and the need for updated curricula. The insights gleaned from the analysis will be instrumental in computing educators gaining a more profound comprehension of GAI 'srole in education and the subsequent development of GAI -enriched curricula.",

We examined 26 peer-reviewed articles published between 2019 and 2024, selected from key databases, including Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, and Google Scholar, using PRISMA methodology. We identified three primary defense mechanisms through thematic analysis: AI-enhanced threat detection systems, adaptive security frameworks, and human-AI collaborative approaches. Our findings indicate that organizations implementing AI-based defense systems showed a 40\% improvement in threat detection rates. However, 73\% of organizations needed help maintaining up-to-date AI models against evolving threats. The review reveals a critical need for dynamic defense architectures that combine real-time AI adaptation with robust human oversight. These findings contribute to theory and practice by providing a comprehensive framework for organizational resilience against AI-driven cyber threats. Future research should address the identified gaps in real-time threat response systems and explore the ethical implications of AI-driven cybersecurity measures.",

The data generated by these devices is utilized for analysis and services, especially in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) applied to IoT, known as AI of Things (AIoT). The enhancement of edge device computing power in the IoT has led to the emergence of research areas like edge–cloud synergy AI theories and application services. In the context of lifelong learning and real-time processes in AIoT edge–cloud synergy services, addressing unseen tasks becomes crucial. Unseen tasks arise when inference requests from edge devices involve models not present in the cloud’s model repository. Addressing these challenges involves generating data to either augment small sample problems or alter the data distribution for heterogeneous sample issues. As the application of large language models (LLMs) for data generation gains traction, challenges emerge in the context of AIoT edge–cloud synergy services. First, fine-tuning LLMs with heterogeneous data exacerbates model bias issues. Second, the substantial data requirements for training LLMs pose a contradiction. Finally, the involvement of manual annotation in LLM-based data generation introduces complexity and cost. This article proposes a framework Seafarer to these challenges using generative adversarial networks and self-taught learning. Seafarer avoids model bias, reduces data requirements, and eliminates the need for manual annotation. The design demonstrates effectiveness theoretically and is validated on the Cityscapes data set, achieving an 80\% reduction in training loss and improved validation loss stability.",

    abstract = "Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) stands at the forefront of the banking sector's technological revolution, promising enhancements in decision-making, risk management, and customer interaction. This paper examines Gen AI's potential to inject innovation and efficiency into banking services, with an estimated value addition of up to $340 billion annually. Grounded in advancements in NLP through Transformer architecture and evolving GPT models, Gen AI's applications in the banking industry are extensive. They range from personalizing customer service with AI-driven chatbots to revolutionizing credit scoring and trading strategies. However, alongside these opportunities, the paper addresses the significant challenges of regulatory compliance, ethical data usage, and the technical integration of AI systems. With the impending release of the EU's AI Act and existing GDPR and DORA, financial institutions must strategize to align with new standards while harnessing Gen AI's capabilities for process optimization and enhanced service delivery. The role of international standards such as ISO/IEC 42001:2023, ISO 31000:2018, ISO/IEC 23894:2023, NIST AI 600-1 and ISO/IEC 23053:2022 is considered to be beneficial in establishing a common framework for managing AI systems, ensuring data integrity and promoting transparency. By adopting these standards, banks can facilitate compliance across various jurisdictions, enhancing operational consistency and reliability – but certain significant limitations in addressing specific regulatory requirements must be taken into account. The paper concludes that Gen AI's future in banking will be transformative, driven by the industry's need to balance technological innovation with ethical and regulatory requirements and process standardization, which will lead to more transparent, personalized and efficient banking services.",

Despite growing concerns among journalists about the privacy risks of AI tools, there is limited scholarly research on how journalists understand AI-related privacy, security, and data protection, particularly in Africa. To address this gap, this study investigates journalists' mental models around privacy policies and data handling by Artificial Intelligence companies responsible for the tools they use. We conducted a qualitative study which interviewed 20 journalists working in Nigeria about their use of GenAI tools in fulfilling their duties, ranging from information verification to reporting. The data collected was analysed using reflexive thematic analysis to draw patterns in the journalists' assumptions about GenAI privacy and the security of their data when interacting with these AI tools. Nigeria was chosen as our case study due to its significance as Africa's largest democracy, and as a country whose AI policy acknowledges and seeks to promote data privacy and security. Our interviews found that journalists have a less-than-ideal mental model of privacy policies and data handling practices by AI companies, leading to potential risk in AI-assisted journalism. We also noted a willingness to share data with AI companies in exchange for some form of value, including better technology, and journalism-specific agentic AI. We conclude that the journalists are willing to do the right thing but lack the time, resources and guidance to do so.",

This presents serious threats to security and privacy. Since deepfakes can be used maliciously to distort photos, movies, and sounds, it is imperative that they are detected as soon as possible. In this paper, a hybrid deep learning model that combines the advantages of Residual Neural Networks (RESNET) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Channel-Wise Attention Mechanisms is presented as a comprehensive method for deepfake detection. The suggested model seeks to precisely detect regions of the face that have been altered and classify faces as authentic or modified. To focus on important facial traits, the model combines the generative capacity of GANs with the discriminative skills of RESNET, which are enhanced by Channel Wise Attention Mechanisms. DFDC, FaceForensic++, CelebDF, and other benchmark datasets are used to assess the performance of this hybrid model. With a precision of 0.79, recall of 0.88, F1-score of 0.83, accuracy of 0.83, and ROC AUC Score of 0.825, it has high performance characteristics. Furthermore, the model undergoes testing against hostile attacks and proves its resilience in actual situations. In addition to accurate deepfake identification, our method offers comprehensive localization of changed regions, which provides important information about which specific facial features have been altered. This feature improves the model’s usefulness in cybersecurity, social media content moderation, and identity verification. This research extends the field of deepfake identification and helps to build more dependable and secure digital systems by tackling the detection as well as the localization of fake characteristics.",

This article explores how generative AI models (like variational autoencoders [VAEs], generative adversarial networks [GANs], or transformer-based architectures) can help to forecast optimal level settings for a beam in real-time.Using huge amounts of satellite telemetry, weather patterns and user traffic data, generative AI can synthesize realistic future network states, cut down on latency and improve signal coverage.AI-driven beamforming entails architectural considerations, training methodologies, and deployment issues. In addition to our review of the performance metrics such as beam alignment accuracy or spectral efficiency, we match nextgeneration predictive models against traditional methods based on statistical analysis and other data manipulation techniques. The results suggest that generative AI can bring a great enhancement to satellite Internet services. This new technology will not only improve coverage but also reduce handover failure rates and power allocation, establishing the groundwork for nextgeneration satellite communication systems that are AI-first.",

The objective of this research is to remove the facial mask on face images using generative adversarial network, or GAN, model. We set up three different training process to explore how to remove a facial mask effectively.

We need to establish intelligent auxiliary diagnosis methods for facial palsy, in which AI-based methods rely on a large number of training samples. However, facial paralysis image samples are small, resulting in low model accuracy, which cannot meet the needs of clinical applications. Therefore, we plan to expand the facial palsy samples through data augmentation methods to reduce the training sample requirements and improve the accuracy of facial palsy grading. We propose the method of fusing generative adversarial networks, where the collected facial paralysis samples are trained by DragGAN model to expand the sample space, and then input into ResNet152 model for classification training. The classification effect of facial palsy images is effectively improved by the principle of data augmentation before classification. The accuracy of this experimental method on the MEEI facial palsy dataset is 85.5\%, the recall is 81.4\%, and the F1-score is 80.7\%, which are 13.1\%, 16.7\%, and 15.8\%, respectively compared to the method without data augmentation. A facial palsy classification model incorporating generative adversarial networks achieves higher classification accuracy compared to methods without data augmentation, providing a new approach to facial palsy classification.",

    abstract = "Zero-shot learning casts light on lacking unseen class data by transferring knowledge from seen classes via a joint semantic space. However, the distributions of samples from seen and unseen classes are usually imbalanced. Many zero-shot learning methods fail to obtain satisfactory results in the generalized zero-shot learning task, where seen and unseen classes are all used for the test. Also, irregular structures of some classes may result in inappropriate mapping from visual features space to semantic attribute space. A novel generative mixup networks with semantic graph alignment is proposed in this article to mitigate such problems. To be specific, our model first attempts to synthesize samples conditioned with class-level semantic information as the prototype to recover the class-based feature distribution from the given semantic description. Second, the proposed model explores a mixup mechanism to augment training samples and improve the generalization ability of the model. Third, triplet gradient matching loss is developed to guarantee the class invariance to be more continuous in the latent space, and it can help the discriminator distinguish the real and fake samples. Finally, a similarity graph is constructed from semantic attributes to capture the intrinsic correlations and guides the feature generation process. Extensive experiments conducted on several zero-shot learning benchmarks from different tasks prove that the proposed model can achieve superior performance over the state-of-the-art generalized zero-shot learning.",

    abstract = "Recently, the rapid growth of cloud computing has created a vast attack surface for malware threats. The existing Support Vector Machine (SVM) accurately detected malwares although the dynamic nature of cloud environments led to high-dimensional data and class imbalance issues. Hence, this research proposes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to address the class imbalance by creating synthetic malware samples. Initially, the input data is collected and fed into the analysis phase with Cuckoo Sandbox to generate malware behavior report in JavaScript Objective Notation (JSON) format. After that, Trend Micro Locality Sensitive Hashing (TLSH) is employed to measure the similarity among files and then the clustering phase groups the similar files as a cluster according to hash values. Further, the features are extracted from JSON format which contains information on Application Programming Interface (API) calls and their return codes. Then, the optimal features are selected using Chi-square to calculate the statistical independence on each feature and finally, GAN model is used to detect malware in cloud environments. From the results, the proposed GAN achieved better results in terms of accuracy (99.61\%) when compared to existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN).",

    abstract = "Autonomous systems are making their way to the market. The transition from tasks performed by humans to tasks performed by machines begs for an answer to one of the most challenging questions in this area of research: Will humans understand and trust what a machine does? Analyzing human and machine behaviors offers the foundational steps toward finding answers to this question. This paper contributes a novel methodology for transforming low-level actions by each agent into high-level categorization of strategies to contrast the behaviors of humans and machines using a computational red teaming environment with a red (evader) and a blue (pursuer) agent. Two orthogonal sources of uncertainty were examined: the uncertainty in the blue agent's situation awareness about the red, and the red agent's uncertainty resulting from deceptive actions by the blue. For each uncertainty source, two different experiments were conducted by varying the controller of the red agent. In one experiment, the red agent was controlled by one of the 34 human subjects; and in the second, by an evolved neural network. The blue agent was controlled by a scripted rule-based system. In this time-critical task, the results revealed that humans tend to follow systemic and consistent strategies, sometimes ignoring the information available to them. On the other hand, machines tend to evolve more complex and diverse strategies. This finding calls for new computational intelligence techniques to enable the fusion of these different strategies into forms that each party can understand and use effectively.",

In this study, we introduce xAAEnet, a novel xAI model applied to the assessment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) severity. OSA is a prevalent sleep disorder that can lead to numerous medical conditions and is currently assessed using the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI). However, AHI has been criticized for its inability to accurately estimate the effect of OSAs on related medical conditions. To address this issue, we propose a human-centric xAI approach that emphasizes similarity between apneic events as a whole and reduces subjectivity in diagnosis by examining how the model makes its decisions. Our model was trained and tested on a dataset of 60 patients’ Polysomnographic (PSG) recordings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model, xAAEnet, outperforms models with traditional architectures such as convolutional regressor, autoencoder (AE), and variational autoencoder (VAE). This study highlights the potential of xAI in providing an objective OSA severity scoring method.Clinical relevance— This study provides an objective OSA severity scoring technique which could improve the management of apneic patients in clinical practice.",

In this paper, we propose a stronger text encoder which employs a text Transformer to extract semantically meaningful parts from text descriptions. With the stronger text encoder, the generator can obtain more meaningful text information to synthesize realistic and text-matching images. In addition, we propose a Dynamic Convolutional text-image Fusion Generative Adversarial Network (DCFGAN) which employs the Dynamic Convolutional Fusion Block to fuse text and image features efficiently. The Dynamic Convolutional Fusion block adjusts the parameters in the convolution layer according to different text descriptions to synthesize text-matching images. It improves the efficiency of fusing text features and image features in generator network. We evaluate the proposed DCF-GAN on two benchmark datasets, the CUB and the Oxford-102.

Specifically, we model complex task offloading in edge computing as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).

Experimental results demonstrate that GAQN exhibits good stability and convergence with proper training, yielding optimal Q values.

First, a lot of new X-ray prohibited item images are generated using the improved Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN). Next, a Cycle GAN based method is proposed to transform the item natural images into the X-ray images. It can enrich the diversity of the new images, including item shape and pose. Then, we combine the prohibited item images with background images to synthesize the new X-ray security checking images. Finally, two single shot multi-box detector (SSD) models are applied to verify whether the enlarged database has achieved data augmentation.

Despite the growing interest in such DTs, the literature lacks a unified framework for their development and implementation. Objective: This study aims to map the existing knowledge on AI-enabled DTs for clinical decision-making, and develop a comprehensive framework for their development and implementation. Methods: Informed by frameworks established by Arksey and O'Malley, and the Joanna Briggs Institute, we performed a scoping review of studies on the development and implementation of AI-enabled DTs for clinical decision-making in any healthcare setting. The search strategy was developed by a librarian for three databases from the date of inception until August 2023. We also conducted a grey literature search on Google Scholar. One reviewer screened titles and abstracts, full-text articles, and charted data, and the second reviewer verified them. Quantitative data were summarized using frequency and proportions, and qualitative data were summarized using content analysis. Key steps in DT development were identified to create the DECIDE-Twin framework. Results: Eleven articles were included: seven reviews and four empirical studies. The reviews contained either a framework or information that was used to construct our comprehensive framework. The empirical studies reported the DT development, and one reported a common infrastructure for a wide range of DT applications. Conclusion: We developed the DECIDE-Twin framework that could serve as a guide for researchers and practitioners in DT development and implementation for clinical decision-making. Further research is needed to validate and implement this framework for various clinical applications.",

    abstract = "Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have the promise to revolutionize the field of digital pathology. However, these models demand considerable amounts of data, while the availability of unbiased training data is limited. Synthetic images can augment existing datasets, to improve and validate AI algorithms. Yet, controlling the exact distribution of cellular features within them is still challenging. One of the solutions is harnessing conditional generative adversarial networks that take a semantic mask as an input rather than a random noise. Unlike other domains, outlining the exact cellular structure of tissues is hard, and most of the input masks depict regions of cell types. This is also the case for non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type of lung cancer. Deciding whether a patient would receive immunotherapy depends on quantifying regions of stained cells. However, using polygon-based masks introduce inherent artifacts within the synthetic images – due to the mismatch between the polygon size and the single-cell size. In this work, we show that introducing random single-pixel noise with the appropriate spatial frequency into a polygon semantic mask can dramatically improve the quality of the synthetic images. We used our platform to generate synthetic images of immunohistochemistry-treated lung biopsies. We test the quality of the images using a three-fold validation procedure. First, we show that adding the appropriate noise frequency yields 87\% of the similarity metrics improvement that is obtained by adding the actual single-cell features. Second, we show that the synthetic images pass the Turing test. Finally, we show that adding these synthetic images to the train set improves AI performance in terms of PD-L1 semantic segmentation performances. Our work suggests a simple and powerful approach for generating synthetic data on demand to unbias limited datasets to improve the algorithms’ accuracy and validate their robustness.",

For each of these directions, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art, with emphasis on techniques that are more relevant for the project. Collectively, these four threads can be seen as enforcing Trustworthy AI and pave the way to transparent and responsible AI systems that are adopted by end-users and may thus unleash the full potential of AI.",

    abstract = "Foundation models have attracted significant attention for their impressive generalizability across diverse downstream tasks. However, they are demonstrated to exhibit great limitations in representing high-frequency components and fine-grained details. In many medical imaging tasks, precise representation of such information is crucial due to the inherently intricate anatomical structures, sub-visual features, and complex boundaries involved. Consequently, the limited representation of prevalent foundation models can result in considerable performance degradation or even failure in these tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pretraining strategy for both 2D images and 3D volumes, named Frequency-advanced Representation Autoencoder (Frepa). Through high-frequency masking and low-frequency perturbation combined with embedding consistency learning, Frepa encourages the encoder to effectively represent and preserve high-frequency components in the image embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an innovative histogram-equalized image masking strategy, extending the Masked Autoencoder approach beyond ViT to other architectures such as Swin-Transformer and convolutional networks. We develop Frepa across nine medical modalities and validate it on 32 downstream tasks for both 2D images and 3D volumes. Without fine-tuning, Frepa can outperform other self-supervised pretraining methods and, in some cases, even surpasses task-specific foundation models. This improvement is particularly significant for tasks involving fine-grained details, such as achieving up to a +15\% increase in dice score for retina vessel segmentation and a +8\% increase in IoU for lung tumor detection. Further experiment quantitatively reveals that Frepa enables superior high-frequency representations and preservation in the embeddings, underscoring its potential for developing more generalized and universal medical image foundation models.",

Low frequency and high collection cost of partial discharge faults lead to the problems of small sample size and imbalance sample, which bring challenges to partial discharge fault detection of 5G based power intelligence system. Hence, in this paper, an data augmentation method that named SVAEWGAN is proposed, which based on stacked variational autocoding and Wasserstein generative adversarial network for partial discharge fault samples in transmission lines to generate fault samples and improve the diversity of samples. Firstly, the stack variational autoencoder is used to extract the depth features of the fault waveform. Secondly, a partial discharge fault sample generation model is constructed by combining stacked variational autocoding and Wasserstein generative adversarial network, and a partial discharge fault detection framework based on the data augmentation method is proposed. Finally, the performance of partial discharge fault detection algorithm based on LightGBM and Bi-LSTM-Attention before and after using data augmentation method is compared and analyzed based on VSB fault detection dataset by selecting accuracy and F1 score, etc. Experiments show that the data augmentation method can effectively improve the performance of partial discharge fault detection, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Traditionally, researchers construct the single generative model based on the whole dataset, which may suffer from mode collapse and scalability problem. In order to overcome these problems, we propose Multi-level Generative Pretrained Transformer (MLGPT) which organizes multiple GPTs in the tree. Each GPT in the tree can learn the unique pattern of malware language for one malware subfamily. Consequently, MLGPT has great potentials to produce more diverse and realistic malware variants than the single generative model. Experimental results show that performance improvement of MLGPT is statistically significant as compared to the single generative model while the construction time of MLGPT is comparable to the single generative model due to the parallel strategy.",

To understand the limitations of this approach to generating reasoning we argue that we need to consider the architectural constraints of these systems. Consideration of the latent variable structure of transformer-decoder models allows us to design reasoning tasks that should probe the boundary of their capacity to reason.
