  pages={49261-49274},
  abstract={Image-generating AI provides diverse sources for ideation in fashion design education. This study explores how collaborative fashion ideation with AI influences image thinking and creativity in a changing media environment. The research method employed design workshops and in-depth interviews with 10 students. The findings reveal that collaborative fashion ideation with AI influences image thinking through visual expansion, exploration of its applicability in fashion, and identifying and lack of sociocultural understanding and identity in idea combination. Collaborative fashion ideation with AI emphasizes creative properties, such as originality, fluency, and flexibility. The results of design workshops, evaluated by experts, indicate higher originality and novelty compared to the control group. The results imply that various factors, such as individual aesthetic presence and the identity of fashion brands, contribute to fashion ideation. Therefore, in collaborative ideation with AI, rather than relying solely on AI tools, it is essential to perceive and approach them as auxiliary tools. This study contributes to elucidating students’ image thinking and creative attributes in fashion ideation, highlighting the impact of collaborative ideation with AI.},

  abstract={How will national cybersecurity stakeholders react to increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) products in the decision-making loop? Diverse AI applications, already a component of military operations, stand to further revolutionize threat-intelligence analytics, curation, and presentation in years to come. In doing so, they portend heightened efficiency and higher tempos of security operations while minimizing risk potential. And yet, challenges abound. AI inputs to deliberative processes may be perceived as more or less robust, accurate, or generalizable according to a range of factors that influence decision-makers. Then these habits and preferences might be reintroduced to the information loop in several ways, as the algorithm, the design/implementation process, and institutions adapt to accommodate the human element. Malicious actors are even likely to target this action-reaction loop to influence AI systems. This two-phase cycle is perhaps most worrisome in relation to cyber conflict, where informational ambiguity, functionally diverse workforces, and an expansive and fragmented threat environment combine to produce an immense opportunity for baking bias into the loop. This paper presents the results of two experiments designed to explore different manifestations of AI systems in the cyber conflict decision-making loop. Though findings suggest that technical expertise positively impacts respondents’ ability to gauge the potential utility and credibility of an input (indicating that training can, in fact, overcome decision-maker bias), the perception of human agency in the loop even in the presence of AI inputs mitigates this cautionary effect and makes decision-makers more willing to operate on less overall information.},

  abstract={In recent years, generative AI models such as ChatGPT, based on Transformer architectures, have developed rapidly and become a hot topic in society. They are widely used in programming, audio, and video processing fields, significantly enhancing productivity in these areas. However, various problems have also arisen during their application. At its core, generative AI still relies on symbolic formal logic and lacks the ability to simulate human cognitive patterns of understanding the world through prior logic or even dialectical logic. As such, it is impossible for these systems to achieve strong artificial intelligence as we know it. Currently, computer systems are founded on discrete mathematics and symbolic logic. This paper proposes an idea that combines prior logic theory with object-oriented programming techniques, using categorical judgment methods as a foundation to mimic human cognition patterns and discusses a possibility of approaching the realization of strong artificial intelligence.},

The study was carried out within the frame of teaching natural science discipline “Chemistry” and socio-cultural ones (“Cultural Studies” and “Sociology”). It involved all types of educational activities and resources for all kinds of classes in these disciplines. It was found that effectiveness of applying artificial intelligence to support these students in mastering disciplines is determined mainly by specifics of a their educational and rehabilitation background. Research has confirmed that generative artificial intelligence can be a good assistant to students only provided that they have developed verbal and so called “21st century skills”: critical and analytical thinking, mastering complex content and working in digital environments.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present the results achieved by performing a test addressed to evaluate the capabilities of the so-called AI content Detectors or AI Detection Systems. Such systems promise to find out whether a given text was written by a human or created by an artificial intelligence (AI). The ability to identify the “synthetic” nature of a text is paramount in many workplaces as well as in the educational field, where we focused our research. More specifically, we considered the academic environment and the frequent request by faculty to students to write term papers on a wide variety of topics. Then, it is essential for teachers to be able to evaluate content quality as well as their authenticity. Until now, anti-plagiarism tools have been widely used to verify that homework assignments were not copied, but the recent advent of generative artificial intelligence-based tools changed the game, moving the focus to automatic generation. In both cases, we are facing a violation of the educational pact by a student, versus a teacher, if not outright an offence. Conversely, an unfounded accusation of fraud by a teacher toward a student would be equally serious. Therefore, to use automatic detection tools one must have a guarantee on the reliability of their output.},

  abstract={The advent of ChatGPT has initiated a boom in the use of artificial intelligence tools in society. From their initial spontaneous application in education, we are gradually moving toward a more thoughtful and systematic approach. To better understand the current state of AI utilization in education, we conducted our own EU Code Week 2024 activity titled “Programming an Animated Music Clip”. The aim of this activity was to foster positive attitudes toward programming among students and teachers, enhance their multimedia literacy, and encourage creativity using artificial intelligence tools. The outcome of this activity is a publicly available collection of animated music clips created by students and teachers from primary, secondary, and higher education institutions. In the article, we analyse the impact of AI utilization on the final projects of the authors. The analysis was carried out using automated tools (Formal Concept Analysis, Dr. Scratch, custom automated tool, R program) and human evaluation. We examined the projects from various perspectives, such as the artificial intelligence tools used, the proportion of multimedia created by humans versus AI, the programming complexity of the projects, and the level of creativity of the authors. In the subsequent section of the article, we present the identified relationships between these aspects and provide recommendations for integrating AI into the teaching process.},

  abstract={In recent years Artificial Intelligence (AI) has found its way into the creative and cultural industries, opening up new challenges and opportunities, poorly sufficiently explored today. However, when it comes to culture and creativity, many social and political cost factors should be taken into account. It is crucial to identify the opportunities that AI can offer in terms of the preservation, use, promotion, and accessibility of Cultural Heritage (CH). However, ethical concerns should be outlined when applying AI in cultural settings, such as for the digital replica of official UNESCO heritage sites or an unbiased explanation and interpretation of a work of art. This paper provides a first attempt to define the main ethical findings on this topic and propose it as an ethical framework to assess different risks arising from the use of AI in the CH domain. The application of this disruptive technology in the arts is evaluated through the lens of ethical principles for trustworthy AI and it explores whether the wider accessibility and improved preservation techniques enabled by AI come at some cost in terms of interpretation, social and cultural inclusion, subjectivism, or other forms of bias. The main ethical principles that emerge from the literature for the application of AI in the cultural domain are the following: Shared Responsibility, Meaningful Participation, Explainability, Accessibility, Sustainability, Reliability and Dignity. The findings underline the importance of establishing specific sectoral ethical guidelines for AI in the field of tangible and intangible CH to support and enhance its sustainable development without compromising its values, significance, sense of belonging and strong social impact.},

  abstract={Summary <p>In response to the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), during the 2022&#x2013;2023 school year, educators voiced concerns over plagiarism, cheating, and the futility of many of their traditional assignments. Conventional plagiarism detection methods became obsolete as generative AI produced individual responses for each student. The development of generative AI technology offers a path to offloading much of the workload that happens behind the scenes of instructional time. AI can help outline curriculum, draft lesson plans, generate assessments, and draft communication and feedback for teachers. One of the fears echoing from most industries is about the future of the workforce in the age of AI. This chapter offers a framework for thinking about how to integrate AI into the educational systems. As AI technologies continue to advance and become more prevalent, educators will need to be prepared to show examples of successful AI integration in education and preemptively answer questions and concerns from stakeholders.</p>},

  abstract={This study examines public opinions, emotional tendencies, and psychological linguistic characteristics associated with the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and the advanced video generation model, Sora, by analyzing discussions on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. A total of 24,727 valid user-generated texts (1,762,296 words) were collected and analyzed using Python and its associated APIs. Word co-occurrence network analysis, topic modeling based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and emotional characteristics based on the DLUT Emotion Ontology and psycholinguistic analyses based on the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionary were employed to explore public views on these generative AI technologies. The findings reveal a shift in public focus over time, from initial excitement about technological advancements to growing interest in commercialization, labor, education, ethics, and global competition. The public’s emotional responses to AI were a mix of excitement and apprehension. The study identifies seven distinct emotional types, providing a nuanced understanding of public psychological reactions, which contrasts with previous binary classifications. This research contributes valuable insights for policymakers, businesses, and researchers, highlighting the public’s evolving acceptance of generative AI technologies.},

  abstract={The advancements in automated problem-solving were explored by the agents of Artificial Intelligence (AI)Generated Content (AIGC). Although existing AIGC-based AI Agent systems can solve simple tasks, it is complicated to handle complex tasks due to inconsistent work logic. In this research, the operating mechanism of AI Agents was dissected to elucidate why AIGC is suitable as the foundation for AI Agents. Based on this technology, we proposed an AI Agent framework named SOP-GPT which has integrated the concept of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) from human workflow into AI Agents. SOP-GPT comprises three main elements: process, role, and skills. By combining the generative capability of AIGC with human SOP mechanisms, the quality of generation was enhanced to meet the expectations of human work requirements. We further explored how to assemble an AIGC engineering process for the division of labor and collaboration methods between various functional departments or units in enterprises in this framework. This research results provide a perspective for human management experience to enhance the capabilities of AI Agents and provide direction for future research.},

  abstract={This research explores the transformative role of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAl) for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) software developers. KSA is transforming from an oil-dependent economy to a diversified one to achieve Vision 2030. Technological advancement is among the strategic objectives of the Kingdom, facilitating the achievement of the ambitious vision. GenAl's ability to undertake tasks like code generation, debugging, and documentation may threaten developers whose jobs could be replaced. However, instead of replacing software engineers, GenAl will create more opportunities for programmers, increase the demand for more experienced developers, and evolve the role of software engineers. While the benefits of GenAl in software engineering are immense, the Kingdom should address the ethical challenges, inadequate transparency, accountability problems, and data privacy issues.

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The pervasive spread of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has borne increasing security risk, with static defense falling to dynamic, smart attacks. The Hybrid Adaptive AI Security Framework (HAASF), a novel framework that combines reinforcement learning (RL), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and swarm intelligence (SI) to provide strong, adaptive security for IoT ecosystems, is what this paper offers. HAASF employs a DQN-based RL defender to acquire dynamic defense prioritization, GANs for strong proactive learning through realistic attack model generation, and PSO-induced SI for IoT node distributed threat mitigation. Evaluated on an NS-3 simulated testbed smart home with 50 devices of diverse hardware, HAASF was compared with five types of attacks, i.e., DDoS, Man-in-the-Middle, Sybil, Data Tampering, and Replay attacks. Against baselines—single RL, signature-based IDS, and CNN-based anomaly detection—HAASF achieved a 95% detection rate, 4% false positive rate, 1.9-second response time, and 40 mW energy consumption. These are HAASF's capabilities in new threat detection, predicting attack patterns, and resource optimization combined against traditional IoT defenses. Through the combination of hybrid AI approaches, HAASF offers scalable, energy-efficient, and responsive security upon which scalable IoT systems can be based in increasingly interconnected and vulnerable systems.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the interaction of non-expert stakeholders with Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the energy urban domain, using the VIRTSI model and focusing on the capabilities of ChatGPT. VIRTSI (Variability and Impact of Reciprocal Trust States towards Intelligent systems), is a rigorous computational model for human-AI Interaction that simulates human trust states, spanning from overtrust to distrust, through user modelling and quantifies the efficiency of the interaction in VIRTSI-adapted confusion matrices. The research employed an 16-question survey, evaluating the accuracy and usefulness of ChatGPT's responses regarding energy consumption, cost-effective solutions, and renewable energy production for residential buildings in Greece. Each answer was assessed by human stakeholders who were non-expert in the energy Urban Domain (e.g house owners, building managers, etc.), who either accepted or rejected the responses based on validation processes. The analysis highlighted key aspects such as repetition, specification, and objections in the interaction with ChatGPT, offering insights into the effectiveness of AI in supporting energy-related decisions. The findings reveal that while AI can provide valuable information, user validation and expert consultation are critical for practical implementation. This highlights both the potential and limitations of integrating AI tools like ChatGPT in enhancing non-expert stakeholder engagement and decision-making in urban energy management, emphasizing the ongoing need for human expert involvement.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) image generation techniques have proved to be potential techniques in the development of the digital creative product design. However, integrating digital culture with modernity while classifying AI image generation technology was a major concern. In this research, the hyper parameter tuned Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Stochastic Gradient (DCNN-SGD) is proposed to overcome these drawbacks, by classifying $A I$ images of product design. The open source AI images are collected and pre-processed to achieve noise free images by applying Gaussian filter. The pre-processed images are then fed to the CNN to extract features. The creative product design process is analysed which includes research and analysis, design expression and the final evaluation. The DCNN with convolutional, pooling and fully connected layers are used for the classification and identification of cultural symbols. For the effective identification of cultural heritage, the hyperparameters of the DCNN are finetuned with SGD. The experimental results showed that the proposed DCNN-SGD achieved better performance with classification accuracy of $\mathbf{9 8. 6 7 \%}$, precision of $\mathbf{9 5. 7 7 \%}$, and recall of $94.26 \%$ when compared to the existing methods improved Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).},

  abstract={This study focused on the use of artificial intelligence to predict precipitation in Columbia. Accurate prediction of rainfall is a challenging problem. This is a serious issue due to the numerous deaths every year due to events caused directly by excess rainfall. While weather forecasting has advanced significantly throughout the years there is still significant room for improvement. One of the main factors detrimental to accurate weather prediction is the multitude of variables required to achieve accurate prediction. Our research seeks to use publicly available satellite imagery to achieve accurate prediction of rainfall with relatively little input data. We seek to achieve that goal by using a custom generative modelling approach to make predictions.},

  abstract={In order to solve the problem of uncivilized speech on campus, a detection method combining semi-supervised generative adversarial network and self-attention mechanism is proposed. The algorithm can use most of the unlabeled samples and a small part of the labeled samples to realize the abnormal detection of uncivilized speech, which solves the problems that the experimental samples are not easy to obtain and the cost of marking is high. In order to make full use of the latent representation learned by the encoder module in the auto-encoder, a new representation term is added to the anomaly score function part; in order to improve the problem of the traditional convolution local receptive field, a self-attention mechanism is introduced into the generative adversarial network Modules that help models learn long-range dependency representations of data. Experiments on self-made datasets show that the method proposed in this paper can improve the ability of model anomaly detection and improve the accuracy of anomaly detection.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of education due to its rapid expansion in educational technology by introducing personalized and efficient learning experiences. Several artificial intelligence (AI) tools are being integrated into this research project such as “Coursera Coach powered by Generative AI” which incorporates adaptive learning, “AI- assisted course building powered by Generative AI” which incorporates intelligent tutoring elements and “Turnitin” offers tools for grading and providing feedback to revolutionize teaching, learning, and assessment practices in higher education. Researchers evaluate the effectiveness of AI tools in enhancing student engagement, personalizing learning experiences, and optimizing assessment processes based on a variety of quantitative metrics. A comparison is made between experimental groups that follow AI-integrated teaching methods and control groups that follow a traditional approach to instruction. As part of the study, scores of pre- and post-assessment questions were collected, learning progression patterns were analyzed, and instructors and students provided qualitative feedback. As a result of the experimental data, it has been possible to discern which AI tools have strengths and limitations within the context of higher education. A variety of adaptive learning platforms are evaluated for their ability to adjust content to individual learning styles, while intelligent tutoring systems are assessed for their impact on comprehension, retention, and problem-solving skills. Automated grading tools are tested for their efficiency gains in assessment processes and their ability to improve feedback promptness and quality. A substantial amount of empirical evidence is provided by the findings of this study to the ongoing discourse on AI integration in higher education. This study provides a wealth of actionable insights for academic staff, technicians, and administrators seeking evidence-based strategies for implementing AI technologies in their educational frameworks.},

  abstract={Promoting student engagement in CSCL has been an important issue for educators. Previous studies have attempted to design retrieval-based conversational agents to assist students in completing collaborative tasks. However, few studies have explored how to integrate generative artificial intelligence with scaffolds to promote student engagement. Addressing the gap, this study developed a collaborative platform that integrates scaffolds with generative AI-based conversational agent. Additionally, a quasi-experiment involving 42 undergraduate students was conducted to examine the impact of this intervention on student engagement, including behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement. The results demonstrated that while the intervention did not significantly improve overall student engagement, it led to a notable increase in cognitive engagement. These findings suggest that generative AI-based agents, when combined with scaffolds, have the potential to target and enhance specific dimensions of engagement in CSCL environments.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is increasingly used by professionals and students to support creative tasks, raising ethical concerns about originality, and transparency. In this paper, we examine the interaction between developers of GAI models and design students, focusing on the nexus between ethics and functionality. Using a design class example, we show how GAI models can help students efficiently and responsibly explore design alternatives by quantitatively assessing their designs' novelty relative to the training data. Through the presented framework, it becomes apparent that the ethical use of GAI models will also require developers to implement specific network architectures. However, the joint interaction will greatly promote transparency in the creative process, support fair monetization of a student's intellectual property, and facilitate the development of high-quality training datasets for future GAI models. By addressing these considerations, we aim to promote the responsible use of GAI in design education and beyond.},

  abstract={Personality recognition from textual data plays a crucial role in various applications such as social media analysis, recommendation systems, and personalized marketing. In this study, we propose an effective personality recognition model leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence based Learning Principles (GAILP), which combines DenseNet feature extraction from user profile images with text-based features extracted using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model is implemented in Python, utilizing popular libraries such as TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and NLTK. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model on a Myers-Briggs Personality Type Dataset obtained from Kaggle, containing self-reported MBTI types and associated textual data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the GAILP model, achieving an accuracy of over 97% in personality recognition tasks. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating visual and textual cues for accurate personality recognition and underscore the potential of GAILP-based approaches in this domain.},

  abstract={This paper analyzes gaps in key safety issues for U.S. Food and Drug Administration and international approvals of artificial intelligence/machine learning-enabled medical devices (AIMD). National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides guidance for patient safety and AIMD security. For example, NIST Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-82r3, and NIST SP 1500-202, Section 2.3.3, suggest approximate patient safety analysis approaches. Related NIST security issues are identified in NIST guidance for artificial intelligence/machine learning risk management, such as NIST's adversarial machine learning guidance. An analytical literature review was conducted within the Johns Hopkins University Sheridan Libraries Catalyst databases to support stated objectives around selected NIST common language terms related to safety and security. The resulting analysis demonstrates that, in the U.S. and on an international scale, selected AIMD literature and guidance may not include or consistently use critical, integrated terms for AIMD security or safety, such as NISTIR 8312's four principles of artificial intelligence explainability. In conclusion, AIMD safety and security could be addressed with NIST common languages.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of Generative AI technology, especially the rise of large-scale language models and diffusion models, the field of semantic communication is facing new opportunities and challenges. Traditional semantic communication systems have some limitations in conveying semantic information in a dynamic environment, but generative artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to break through this bottleneck with its ability of context understanding and data generation. This paper proposes GenAI-SC, a generative semantic communication architecture that utilizes large-scale pre-training models for semantic information extraction and adopts a diffusion model as its core. The architecture extracts and compresses semantic information through large-scale models and utilizes diffusion models to achieve high-quality image recovery, which is especially suitable for complex communication environments. To verify the effectiveness of this architecture, this paper design two task modes, plain text diffusion image generation and text-image joint diffusion generation, to flexibly cope with different transmission tasks. The experimental results show that GenAI-SC performs well under different channel conditions and inference steps, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio environment, showing that GenAI-SC has good multitasking capability and communication robustness. This paper provides an innovative path for the design and implementation of semantic communication system.},

  abstract={Generative models are an important class of models in the field of artificial intelligence. Unlike models that aim to establish a mapping between inputs and outputs by extracting features, the goal of generative models is to learn the distribution of training data and generate new samples with similar features from a latent space. In the development of generative models, efforts have been made to improve the diversity of generated samples, progressing from VAE (variational auto-encoders). VAE achieves random sampling and generation of diverse images by transforming the bottleneck layer of the encoder from predicting low-dimensional feature maps to predicting positions sampled from a normal distribution. Subsequently, vector quantized variational autoencoders(VQ-VAE) and VQ-VAE-2 models were introduced, followed by the first-generation DALL-E model, and then diffusion models. We will discuss the basic principles of each model, the strengths and weaknesses of the models, and the innovations introduced by each model compared to its predecessors. After that, an overview of the evaluation metrics specific to generation models is provided. Finally, the applications that generation model enables are summarized. This review provides creative ideas for the future development of generative models.},

  abstract={The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Generative AI, is poised to bring significant changes to various aspects of the human world. While there is ongoing debate about the use of AI for writing manuscripts, completing assignments, and other working tasks, this research takes a step back to address a fundamental question: How accurate and efficient is AI in helping to conduct research? This research focuses on the initial step of research - literature search and screening. As the volume of academic literature grows exponentially, efficient and effective methods for synthesizing existing knowledge become crucial for scientific discovery. This research aims to explore the potential of AI-driven solutions in the literature screening process and compare them with traditional labor- and time-intensive approaches. Adopting a comparative analysis approach, this research examines both traditional manual screening techniques and AI-powered approaches and evaluates AI’ s performances. Data were collected from a comprehensive review of existing literature on the multidisciplinary topic of the digital divide. The analysis focuses on the accuracy, efficiency, and usefulness of AI in processing large volumes of literature. Results suggested that AI-driven approaches can reduce substantial manual work and time investment while maintaining certain levels of accuracy in identifying relevant studies. However, the challenge of algorithmic bias remains, and this calls for human intervention. Instead of AI replacing humans, our findings suggest a hybrid approach - combining AI capabilities with human expertise. Such an approach offers the most promising solutions for future literature review and screening processes, evidencing the synergy between AI and humans.},

  abstract={Night vision technology provides an important means for night observation by using infrared radiation of the target as the imaging basis. Recently, artificial neural network (ANN) has become a research hotspot. Realizing the classification and recognition of infrared images by ANN is helpful to the intelligent development of night vision technology, as well as improve the accurate judgment of the surrounding environment by unmanned vehicles at night, and better ensure the safety of people and vehicles. However, the existing infrared image data set contains a small number of images, and the types of scenes and targets presented in the images are single, which cannot support the training of ANN. ANN cannot obtain the classification function of infrared images through full learning. In this paper, an infrared image generative model based on generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed, which can convert the existing visible light data set into the infrared version of the data set in a short time, and then solve the problem of lack of infrared image data sets. To train ResNet by infrared version data set can realize its classification function for infrared images. The model with the existing image generative model is compared through several evaluation indexes. The results show that the model is more effective in generative infrared images. Inputting ImageNet data set into this model can generate ImageNet infrared version data set. ResNet trained by this data set has a classification and recognition accuracy of 91.28%, which is higher than the experimental results of existing image generative models. The design and implementation of infrared image generative model in this paper promote the application of artificial intelligence and depth learning in night vision technology and other fields.},

While recent initiatives, such as the European Union's AI Act and UNESCO's Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, have provided frameworks for ethical AI adoption, their practical implementation at the institutional level remains uneven. This study investigates how university faculty perceive the ethical implications of AI use in academic environments. Conducted as part of the EmpowerAI Erasmus+ project, a structured focus group involving 21 lecturers from the Technical University of Sofia in Bulgaria explored faculty staff attitudes toward AI's role in areas such as critical thinking, authorship, fairness, access, and privacy. Through thematic analysis, the study identifies emerging tensions between innovation and responsibility, and between equitable access and academic rigor. The findings underscore the need for context-sensitive institutional policies and educator training on AI ethics.

  abstract={This article unveils CodeBlizz, an innovative AI-powered add-on for IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) like Visual Studio Code. This software program makes use of generative AI to provide developers with seamless access to educational assets along with support for real-time debugging, and context-aware code suggestions. Compared to various code completion tools on the market, CodeBlizz takes a complete strategy to dramatically lower the learning curve for inexperienced workers while simultaneously increasing coding productivity. This is achieved through the direct integration of learning resources into the working environment. CodeBlizz utilizes proficient transformer-based models, such as CodeBERT for comprehending syntax and producing useful snippets and GPT-3 to generate context-aware code referrals. Also, the plugin employs T5 models to provide real-time problem detection and debugging support by turning malfunctioning code into error messages and possible fixes. Added to that, adaptive learning from user feedback is feasible with reinforcement learning models such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN), which boosts the accuracy of the model over time. Together, these machine learning elements allow CodeBlizz to provide developers with solid and dynamic support from within the IDE, which helps to boost accuracy and speed up code completion. Without pushing users to leave the IDE, the plugin renders functionalities encompassing dynamically generated code snippets, syntax correction, error pattern identification, and real-time tutorials for learning at ease. On the survey, users reported a thirty percent reduction in time spent on error correction and tutorial seeks from online websites, which further validates the benefit of incorporating AI that generates code for immediate guidance within the coding routine. Early testing demonstrates a significant boost in coding accuracy.},

  abstract={This paper presents a systematic review of studies related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications in Supply Chain Management (SCM). Our systematic search studied 109 journal articles published between 2007 and 2025. It was presented definitions for AI, ML, and SCM and a bibliometric analysis was carried out to examine trends and patterns in the existing literature. The 109 articles were grouped into five clusters based on keywords and abstracts, identifying promising research areas and proposes directions for future investigations. The current literature on AI and ML in SCM is expanding, with an increasing number of publications and growing diversity in applications, although significant gaps remain warranting attention. Various AI and ML techniques, including supervised learning algorithms, neural networks, and optimization techniques, have been studied in scenarios such as demand forecasting, inventory management, and risk analysis. Additionally, AI and ML methods are expected to gain broader acceptance in SCM scenarios, such as, application of Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs); Quantum ML techniques to handle with large SCM data; to implement SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for demand forecasting and fraud detection; and to use Generative AI models (like,  $\mathrm{GPT-4}$ ) to generate synthetic supply chain scenarios.},

  abstract={Digital literacy plays an important role in teachers’ professional competence, especially in the context of digital transformation in education. With the advancement of digital technology, enhancing learners’ high awareness ability in digital literacy has become a key step in literacy development. On this basis, this study employed the response surface methodology (RSM) to evaluate various test indicators, including the number of words, number of answer points, and number of follow-up rounds, and evaluation indicators, including accuracy, expansion, and awareness, for generative artificial intelligence (GAI). A four-step process was followed that includes basic analysis of experiment results, factor estimation and variance analysis, multifactor response surface analysis, and indicator analysis. The findings indicate that the test factors related to the GAI-generated content had a significant impact on participants’ high awareness levels. These factors exhibited interactive effects, and the response surface model revealed an optimal approach for applying GAI to enhance awareness. Building on these insights, practical suggestions are proposed for using GAI to enhance digital literacy. On the basis of the research conclusions, practical approaches to applying GAI to enhance high awareness ability in digital literacy are proposed. These approaches include employing the critical point perturbation mechanism, role-oriented mechanism, and high awareness thinking chain mechanism. This study employed GAI to investigate learners’ high awareness ability in digital literacy, providing a case for the proper and innovative use of GAI in the context of education. Additionally, it provides information on the educational effectiveness of GAI and offers valuable references for similar studies on GAI applications.},

  abstract={Since its first appearance, artificial intelligence has been ensuring revolutionary outcomes in the context of real-world problems. At this point, it has strong relations with biomedical and today&#x2019;s intelligent systems compete with human capabilities in medical tasks. However, advanced use of artificial intelligence causes intelligent systems to be black-box. That situation is not good for building trustworthy intelligent systems in medical applications. For a remarkable amount of time, researchers have tried to solve the black-box issue by using modular additions, which have led to the rise of the term: interpretable artificial intelligence. As the literature matured (as a result of, in particular, deep learning), that term transformed into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). This book provides an essential edited work regarding the latest advancements in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for biomedical applications. It includes not only introductive perspectives but also applied touches and discussions regarding critical problems as well as future insights. Topics discussed in the book include: &#x2022; XAI for the applications with medical images &#x2022; XAI use cases for alternative medical data/task &#x2022; Different XAI methods for biomedical applications &#x2022; Reviews for the XAI research for critical biomedical problems. Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Biomedical Applications is ideal for academicians, researchers, students, engineers, and experts from the fields of computer science, biomedical, medical, and health sciences. It also welcomes all readers of different fields to be informed about use cases of XAI in black-box artificial intelligence. In this sense, the book can be used for both teaching and reference source purposes.},

  abstract={Graphics algorithms for high quality image rendering are highly involved process, as layout, components, and light transport must be explicitly simulated. While existing algorithms excel in this task, creating and formatting virtual environments is a costly and time-consuming process. Thus, there is an opportunity for automating this labor intensive process by leveraging recent development in computer vision. Recent development in deep generative models, especially GANs, has spurred much interest in the computer vision domain for synthesizing realistic images. GANs combine backpropagation with a competitive process involving a pair networks, called Generative Network G and Discriminative Network D, in which G generate artificial images and D classifies it into real or artificial image categories. As the training proceeds, G learns to generate realistic images to confuse D [1]. In this work, a convolutional architecture based on GAN, specifically Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) has been implemented to train a generative model that can produce good quality images of human faces at scale. CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) has been used to train the DCGAN model. Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), that measures the structural and contextual similarity of two images, has been used for quantitative evaluation of the trained DCGAN model. Obtained results shows that the quality of generated images is quite similar to the high quality images of the CelebA dataset.},

  abstract={Designing programs is a purposeful method of implementing design plans in a scientific manner, playing a key role in normative design processes, improving efficiency, ensuring quality, and guiding creativity in artistic design. However, traditional design processes are often constrained by factors such as human resources, time costs, and experience limitations, resulting in inefficiency and limited creativity. Generative artificial intelligence is providing new possibilities for optimizing design processes. This article proposes an optimized design program strategy that can improve the efficiency of design programs, reduce design costs, and enhance design quality by introducing generative artificial intelligence. In addition, the optimized design program is evaluated from aspects such as the efficiency of process execution, the quality of design results, and the participation and satisfaction of team members to validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Findings of this study can help researchers and practitioners develop and optimize models that are more suitable for content output, promoting their application in the field of artistic design.},

  abstract={Applications of artificial intelligence in medical imaging include classification, segmentation, and treatment planning. Using current deep-learning techniques, developing these systems requires large amounts of labelled training data. Obtaining this data is challenging due to costs, required expertise, inconsistency of imaging procedures and formatting, and patient privacy concerns. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) may alleviate some of these issues by supplying realistic artificial medical images. In this study, we trained progressively growing (PG)GAN to synthesize full-sized computed tomography (CT) images and succeeded. Performance of the PGGAN was evaluated using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), Inception Score (IS), and Precision (P) and Recall (R). These metrics were calculated for generated, training, and validation images. The influence of dataset size was explored by varying the number of samples used to calculate each metric; this affected FID, P, and R, but not IS, which has obvious implications for comparing studies. The FID between artificial CT images from PGGAN and real validation images was 42; interestingly, FID between real training and validation images was 24. This suggests that a further reduction of 18 could be achieved by improving the generative model. Overall, artificial CT images generated by PGGAN were almost indistinguishable from real images to the human eye, although computational metrics could identify differences between them. In future work, GANs may be deployed to augment data for training medical AI systems.},

  abstract={The utilization of Generative AI (GEN AI) has experienced a substantial increase because of investments and a variety of applications in various sectors. In 2023, the aggregate investment in generative AI exceeded $10 billion. Additionally, AI is a highly prevalent technology in China, with 83% of its companies significantly relying on it. Subsequently, India accounts for 73% of Gen AI usage, while Malaysia's data suggests that this technology is employed in the marketing sector. This investment has resulted in an increased utilization of AI tools in the areas of retail, supply chain management, and customer service. This technology enhances productivity, efficiency, and creativity in a variety of sectors. Nevertheless, it raises a few challenges that necessitate robust governance and regulation. GEN AI prioritizes transparency and accountability; AI systems could perpetuate prejudices and erode trust in the absence of regulations. In the context of contemporary concerns, this paper assesses the regulatory endeavors and issues of Malaysia and India with respect to Generative AI. This paper employs doctrinal research on primary and secondary sources. Malaysia and India have recently disclosed a variety of data breaches and unethical Gen AI practices. Therefore, even though Generative AI is streamlining marketing and assisting in numerous business sectors, the government must re-evaluate its governance, including legal and regulatory mechanisms, to determine whether it complies with international standards and contemplate reforms. The government must also look into balancing the need for innovation and evaluate data protection and privacy concerns.},

  pages={58800-58822},
  abstract={Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) hold immense potential to revolutionize transportation, yet their deployment raises significant concerns regarding safety, security, and ethical considerations. Furthermore, the increased use of automation, edge computing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), fueled by generative AI technology, has increasingly elevated the risks of AI. Most of the existing research only covers ethical components and lacks the breadth of Responsible AI (RAI), while some have presented components such as justice and solidarity but do not provide an approach or mechanism to implement those in an AI-based system. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a comprehensive RAI framework for AVs with four key contributions. First, it provides an in-depth analysis of AI risks in AVs, encompassing safety, security, ethical, and legal domains, offering a structured classification to guide developers and regulators. Second, it introduces a holistic RAI framework that spans the AI lifecycle, identifying and mitigating risks at each AV system development and deployment stage. Third, the paper focuses on bias and fairness within AV systems, outlining precise techniques for bias detection and mitigation across data collection, algorithm design, and real-time decision-making. Lastly, the research presents bias removal simulations using publicly available AV datasets, evaluating mitigation strategies such as synthetic data generation and algorithmic fairness analysis. The proposed framework and simulations provide a practical foundation for integrating RAI principles into AV development, ensuring safer, fairer, and more accountable AI-driven mobility solutions.},

The data stored on a blockchain is immutable and secured with cryptography. The blockchain can guarantee data security without the involvement of a third party. The integration of it with AI to create distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) is increasingly being used in various areas of human activity. AI can increase the efficiency of blockchains by streamlining computations and processes, reducing the burden on miners and decreasing latency. The latter results in faster transactions and reduced carbon footprint of the blockchain technology. Blockchain can help develop explainable AI by means of accessing an immutable record of unstructured medical data and processes used by the system in its decision-making process.

  abstract={Fluorescence imaging in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II) facilitates the real-time optical contrast for in vivo biomedical imaging. However, the detection noise is an inevitable byproduct of the real-time imaging process. Additionally, fluorescent probes currently approved for clinical use remain limited within the wavelength of NIR-IIa (1000–1300 nm). NIR-IIb (1500–1700 nm) imaging has the potential to deliver higher resolution than NIR-IIa, but relies on toxic fluorescent probes not approved for human use. To support clinical high-precision imaging, we propose a NIR-II fluorescence enhanced imaging method based on perception-enhanced spectrum shift generative adversarial network with explainable AI systems (xAI-PSSGAN). The proposed method tackles the problem of limited unpaired data training, and generates NIR-IIb resembling images with enhanced resolution and reduced noise. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed method effectively improves the imaging quality and surpasses competing alternatives, which is of great significance to promote the high-quality NIR-II imaging in clinical practice.},

  abstract={The integration of music and video is a pivotal aspect of creating impactful advertisements. This study explores the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in generating music tailored for video advertisements through a system we developed, named Ourmuse. By leveraging advanced Generative AI models, Ourmuse aims to enhance the synchronization between music and video content. The methodology involves extracting and analyzing still images and texture context from the video. A critical aspect of our approach is the plot-based training of the AI model by identifying transition points between video scenes, where the video is segmented into distinct parts rather than being treated as a single unit. This segmentation ensures that Ourmuse produces music that is coherent and contextually appropriate for each segment, enhancing the overall impact and cohesion of the final advertisement. By focusing on multi-modal inputs and plot-specific training, this research aims to develop a robust AI model capable of revolutionizing the music composition process for video advertisements.},

  abstract={The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and music generation has revolutionized the field of musical composition, ushering in a new era of creative possibilities. This comprehensive review explores two groundbreaking studies that illustrate the profound impact of AI in music: AI-driven music remixing and AI-generated music composition. The first approach employs state-of-the-art deep learning and neural network architectures to enhance music remixing by recognizing intricate audio patterns, resulting in remarkably inventive remixes. The second method harnesses generative adversarial networks (GANs) and reinforcement learning to compose original music pieces that rival human-created compositions. Both studies exemplify AI’s capacity to reshape the landscape of musical creativity, offering novel avenues for artistic expression. This paper not only examines these pioneering studies but also delves into the broader implications of AI in music, highlighting its potential to revolutionize music production and inspire a new generation of musicians.},

  abstract={The launch of ChatGPT in 2022 garnered global attention, marking a significant milestone in the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) field. While GAI has been in effect for the past decade, the introduction of ChatGPT sparked a new wave of research and innovation in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain. This surge has led to the development and release of numerous cutting-edge tools, such as Bard, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, Make-A-Video, Runway ML, and Jukebox, among others. These tools exhibit remarkable capabilities, encompassing tasks ranging from text generation and music composition, image creation, video production, code generation, and even scientific work. They are built upon various state-of-the-art models, including Stable Diffusion, transformer models like GPT-3 (recent GPT-4), variational autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks. This advancement in GAI presents a wealth of exciting opportunities across various sectors, such as business, healthcare, education, entertainment, and media. However, concurrently, it poses unprecedented challenges such as impersonation, job displacement, privacy breaches, security vulnerabilities, and misinformation. To addressing these challenges requires a new direction for research to develop solutions and refine existing products. In our endeavor to contribute profound insights to society and advance research on GAI, we present a comprehensive journal which explores the theoretical and mathematical foundations of GAI state-of-the-art models, exploring the diverse spectrum of tasks they can perform, examining the challenges they entail, and discussing the promising prospects for the future of GAI.},

  abstract={With the prevalence of generational artificial intelligence (AI) in everyday life, there has been a recent increase in research on individuals' perceptions and attitudes towards generational AI. However, with the breadth of use cases and applications made available with the advancements in large language models (LLMs), there are increasing signs that attitudes towards LLM-based generative AI may be context or use-case dependent. We examine the contextualised trust of individuals in AI, the support for using AI, and AI adoption intentions in a survey experiment ($\mathrm{N}=306$) across three contexts (reasons): technical, mental health, and creative assistance. Participants read ostensible news articles about AI use in one of these three contexts, and completed a survey on their resultant and previous attitudes. The results show that trust and adoption were significantly higher for technical assistance, and lower for creative assistance and mental health assistance. However, support for using AI for mental health assistance was significantly higher than creative assistance, and comparable to technical assistance. Contextualised trust and support also significantly predicted AI adoption intentions, above and beyond trust scores towards AI in general. Our study suggests that contextualised attitudes towards specific AI products appear to be sufficiently differentiated from (general) AI attitudes, and instances where AI is used for technical reasons, as opposed to creative or mental health reasons, garners more favourable attitudes.},
