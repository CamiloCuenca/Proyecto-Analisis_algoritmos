  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={57-70},
  abstract={In the wave of technological innovation, generative artificial intelligence tools provide college students with personalized learning experience, promote autonomous learning and exploratory learning, and improve learning outcomes through intelligent tutoring and instant feedback. However, existing research shows that generative artificial intelligence tools still face multiple obstacles in practical application, such as differences in students' acceptance of new technologies, privacy protection challenges, and difficulties in integrating with the existing education system. This study is based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), a technology acceptance model, and specifically introduces perceived risk as a moderating variable. Combining key factors such as college students' cognitive characteristics and technological environment, this study constructs a theoretical model that affects college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools.The study found that performance expectations, effort expectations, social influence, and convenience conditions have a significant positive impact on college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools; effort expectations have a positive impact on performance expectations; convenience conditions have a positive impact on effort expectations; effort expectations mediate the relationship between convenience conditions and willingness to use; and perceived risk negatively moderates the impact of convenience conditions on willingness to use. It is expected that through this empirical study, the key factors that affect college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools will be deeply explored, and valuable suggestions and references will be provided for guiding technology optimization and education integration practices, which will help develop generative artificial intelligence tools that better meet the needs of college students and promote innovation and improvement of online education models.},

  title={Understanding Structure Of LLM using Neural Cluster Knockout}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={253-259},
  abstract={This research work presents a groundbreaking approach at the intersection of neuroscience and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), focusing on the application of neuroscience techniques to neural networks, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs). Central to this study is the concept of ‘neural cluster knockout’ in LLMs, a method inspired by lesion studies in neuroscience involving the systematic removal of neuron clusters to decipher their role within the model. The research underscores the opaque nature of neural networks, particularly LLMs, which are often critiqued for their ‘black box’ operation. By adopting neuroscience principles, particularly lesion studies, this paper aims to illuminate the inner workings of neural networks, enhancing our understanding of their functionalities. This is crucial in an era increasingly reliant on AI in various sectors, where insights from this study could lead to the development of more efficient, transparent, and accountable AI systems. Methodologically, this study involved Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and neural cluster knockout through iterative zeroing, applied to the Large Language Model named LLaMA. This approach enabled the identification of significant neuron clusters and their functional impacts when deactivated. The results reveal both critical and redundant neurons within LLMs, demonstrating that some clusters are vital for accuracy, while others may impede efficiency or contribute to errors. This research contributes significantly to the AI field, offering a novel perspective on the intricate architecture of LLMs. It lays a foundation for future advancements in AI, envisioning refined and efficient LLMs capable of more accurate and reliable performance.},

  abstract={Summary <p>The ideas behind mindset are closely tied to the idea of organizational culture &#x2013; which is also often either an aid or impediment to the successful adoption of new technologies. As GenAI becomes more powerful and more widely accessible, how proficient we become at putting it to work in order to drive efficiency and create value will increasingly become a driver of success. Competition for talent &#x2013; especially AI&#x2010;literate talent &#x2013; is intense. So having put all that thought into essential skills, and equipping people with the skills for success, it makes sense that we really want talent to stick around. The base layer is fast networks and connectivity, data infrastructure, and cybersecurity. These three are the foundational tech building blocks that will help us leverage GenAI (and other cutting&#x2010;edge technologies) successfully. Before making any decisions about GenAI technologies, it's really important to get our foundational technologies right.</p>},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={143-153},
  abstract={Summary <p>GenAI is ushering in a transformative era in healthcare, with far&#x2010;reaching implications for patient care, diagnostics, and more. There's a lot happening in this field, so this chapter touches on key developments only, with a particular focus on: personalized advice for patients; detection of diseases; personalized treatment; and operational improvement. GenAI can help to reduce the administrative burden in healthcare by automating tasks such as medical coding, billing, routine enquiries, and notetaking. GenAI tools can empower individuals to take charge of their own healthcare, by engaging in discussions with healthcare chatbots about potential diagnoses and treatment options, and seeking medical help when needed. When a GenAI tool generates inaccurate or &#x201c;hallucinated&#x201d; content in a sector like marketing, it's probably rather embarrassing for the company using that content. GenAI can help to solve some of the biggest challenges facing global healthcare systems and make healthcare much more accessible and efficient.</p>},

  pages={259-273},
  abstract={Summary <p>This research paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the generation of synthetic medical datasets, leveraging advanced generative models to produce high&#x2010;quality, privacy&#x2010;preserving synthetic datasets. Specifically, we investigate three distinct models from the Gretel platform: Tabular&#x2010;ACTGAN, Tabular&#x2010;Differential&#x2010;Privacy, and Tabular&#x2010;LSTM, each tailored to address different aspects of tabular data synthesis with a focus on healthcare data. Tabular&#x2010;ACTGAN excels in generating numerical data with high column counts and unique categorical fields, offering conditional data generation capabilities. Tabular&#x2010;Differential&#x2010;Privacy provides strong differential privacy guarantees, making it ideal for datasets with categorical variables and ensuring individual privacy in the generated data. Tabular&#x2010;LSTM supports a wide range of data types and introduces automatic data semantic validation to ensure the fidelity and utility of the synthetic data. This study finds that Tabular&#x2010;Differential&#x2010;Privacy outperforms other two models scoring 6 out of 10. It also outshines others by scoring 92% in the synthetic data quality score. Tabular&#x2010;ACTGAN is best when measured against principal component stability, scoring 100%. Tabular&#x2010;LTSM scores 91% for field correlation stability.</p>},

  abstract={Summary <p>As well as ushering in a new era of connectedness (and cat memes) the internet played a pivotal role in the evolution of AI. In the 2000s, as more and more of our everyday activities moved online, the resulting explosion in big data provided a huge boost for the evolution of AI. An area of recent development is domain&#x2010;specific generative models, which are models tailored to specific industries and applications, such as drug discovery. The roots of GenAI stretch as far back as the 1950s, when scientists and researchers first introduced the concept of intelligent machines. Most notably, the Turing Test&#x2013;designed to prove whether a computer can demonstrate human&#x2010;like intelligence &#x2013; was introduced in 1950. The mid&#x2010;2010s onwards saw the development of neural networks that power GenAIs. The release of ChatGPT in 2022 marked a significant milestone and spawned an AI arms race.</p>},

Like any AI, GenAI tools are given enormous amounts of data to learn from (what's known as &#x201c;training data&#x201d;). Generative adversarial networks work by pitting two competing algorithms against each other, one tasked with generating data that resembles its training data and the other tasked with trying to tell whether the output is real or generated. Alongside ChatGPT, there are other generative text tools like Google's Bard and Meta's Llama. These tools can be used to write anything from essays and articles, to plays, poems, and novels. GenAI makes it easy to create entirely synthetic data for use in training other AI models.</p>},

  abstract={Summary <p>A 2023 report by Indeed analyzed job listings and skills to identify their exposure to GenAI automation. GenAI, by nature, excels at tasks involving the generation of output based on existing information. As a result, jobs that are repetitive, predictable, and don't require deep human intuition are at the highest risk of being affected. Customer service representative is a job that faces one of the highest risks of becoming redundant thanks to GenAI. While GenAI can automate code writing for certain tasks, software development is also about problem&#x2010;solving, design, and understanding human needs &#x2013; areas where humans excel. Generative AI can be used to create music, video content, virtual realities, and even video game elements. Professionals who can harness this tech for creative endeavors are emerging. The effectiveness of GenAI hinges on the quality of data it's trained on.</p>},

  abstract={Summary <p>AI has been making inroads into education for the last few years, and as with many sectors, GenAI will massively accelerate this trend. In any education setting, from schools and colleges to self&#x2010;directed lifelong learning, GenAI has the capacity to provide super&#x2010;personalized learning, make teachers' jobs easier, and help students understand topics more easily. GenAI can also be used to generate personalized follow&#x2010;up questions to help cement understanding. Kortext is an interesting example. The education platform is designed to help universities and colleges provide AI&#x2010;enhanced teaching and personalized learning experiences. The use of GenAI in college applications is another hot topic. Common App, the college application tool used by more than 1000 institutions, has included a restriction on the use of &#x201c;substantive content or output of an artificial intelligence platform&#x201d; in college applications.</p>},

  abstract={Summary <p>GenAI can turn natural language instructions into functioning code, which essentially turns English (or whatever our native tongue is) into a computer programming language. Clearly, GenAI is going to be a revolutionary tool for programmers. But it may also prove a useful tool for everyday folks who want to, say, build an app or create a piece of software, but don't know any programming languages. Seattle&#x2010;based real estate company, Redfin, has used large language models including ChatGPT to help with programming tasks. Codacy is an AI code quality/code analysis tool that helps to automate code analysis. CodeWhisperer is Amazon's code generation tool, developed using open&#x2010;source code and Amazon's own data. The tool takes natural language prompts and creates code based on the programmer's objectives, in their style. It can also be used for code completion.</p>},

  abstract={Summary <p>This chapter explores the problem of being rich in data but poor in insights, and discovers how GenAI can help businesses get more out of data. Through real&#x2010;time tracking of data, decision makers can gain a better grasp of what's happening across the business and be presented with actionable insights suggested by the GenAI. Big data company, Alteryx, is also leveraging GenAI to help non&#x2010;skilled workers better visualize and understand the trends within their data. With its AI Studio, Alteryx customers can also use those insights to build new applications that streamline business operations, enhance processes, and improve productivity &#x2013; through a conversational interface. Cloud&#x2010;based data company, Snowflake, has also brought GenAI to its data cloud platform. Snowflake Cortex allows users to chat with their data, detect sentiment in data, extract answers, summarize information, and translate text to a selected language.</p>},

  abstract={Summary <p>Banks and other financial institutions are already starting to implement GenAI. GenAI can create sophisticated financial models that simulate various economic and market conditions to predict their effects on investment portfolios, asset values, or institutional risk exposure. Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti&#x2013;Money Laundering processes are critical for banks to mitigate financial crime and maintain regulatory compliance. GenAI can assist in automating these processes by analyzing large amounts of customer data, including personal data and transaction history, and identifying potential compliance issues. Another example comes from insurance and financial services company, Nationwide, which has been using GenAI to improve pet insurance provision by helping pet owners take better care of their pets' health. Morgan Stanley has been experimenting with OpenAI's GPT&#x2010;4 model, using the language model as a sort of encyclopedia for financial advisors.</p>},

  abstract={In recent years, research on remote sensing object detection has primarily focused on oriented box representation and optimization, while overlooking the importance of studying feature extraction networks, leading to inaccurate identification of some targets. The conventional feature extraction networks employ fixed-size convolutional kernels, which fail to capture different levels of visual features for targets of varying sizes. In this paper, we propose a mechanism called the 3D-Weight Guide Selective Kernel (3D-WGSK) to jointly utilize spatial and channel information of input features to derive three-dimensional weights. These weights are then employed for convolutional kernel selection, enabling adaptive receptive field acquisition for capturing features of targets with different sizes. We devise a network architecture named the 3D-WGSK Net for feature extraction in remote sensing object detection. It possesses the capability of multi-scale information fusion and adaptive kernel adjustment, effectively extracting crucial features of targets with varying sizes. Experimental results on the publicly available DOTA-v1.5 dataset demonstrate the superior detection performance of our method.},
