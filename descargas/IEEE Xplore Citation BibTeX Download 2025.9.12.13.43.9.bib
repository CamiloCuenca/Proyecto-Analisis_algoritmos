  abstract={This paper proposes an integrated generative AI learning literacy approach based on project-based learning to harness the transformative potential of generative AI in higher education. It provides a novel framework for integrating generative AI into project-based learning that aims to develop students' skills in three key aspects to grasp the application of generative AI as an effective problem-solving tool: (1) understanding algorithmic mechanisms, (2) identifying biases, and (3) using AI tools to solve problems. The process of integrating generative AI begins with assessing prior knowledge, introducing relevant problem-solving learning and AI tools, and designing course pathways and peer assessments through social media to cultivate students' problem-solving pathways. In addition, this paper recommends evaluating the effectiveness of AI-integrated courses through a comprehensive post-course survey of students and instructors.},

  abstract={The influences of emotions, anthropomorphism, cognitive assessments, social influence, and motivation are vital in shaping users' acceptance and usage of artificial intelligence software. The challenge for generative AI software lies in evaluating users' emotions, cognitions, and perceptions. The assessment of factors like performance expectancy, effort expectancy, anthropomorphic traits, intrinsic motivation, social influence, and emotions are crucial to understanding users' readiness to adopt such software. To interpret users' acceptance levels during interactions with generative AI chatbot software, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology Model and Cognitive Appraisal Theory serve as theoretical frameworks. The model was empirically validated using data from an online survey. The analysis of generative AI software acceptance, along with the factors influencing users' willingness to use it, was conducted using PLS-SEM. The results highlighted that emotions are a significant determinant of software acceptance and support the proposed three-tier appraisal model for accepting the use of Generative AI Software.},

  abstract={This work explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve research skills in engineering education, specifically at the time of conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). While AI has previously been employed for basic tasks related to SLRs, such as relevant paper screening and classification within scope, there is still limited research on information retrieval from the full texts of scientific papers. This study focuses on the next phase in the SLR, which involves scientific documentary analysis. The methodology presented in this work compares the AI tools in the market to facilitate scientific documentary analysis and enhance and refine research skills in engineering students. Also, this paper addresses the challenges to automatically run documentary analysis during a SLR. To do so, several techniques to extract information from AIs are presented, including Application Programming Interfaces (API) or Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). According to the results, most of the AI tools have a limitation in the operations students can perform per day. Only PDFgear offers a no-cost solution with unlimited usage, while some other AI tools allow limited usage for not so high prize. In conclusion, this paper presents a contribution during the documentary analysis of a SLR. It is important to keep in mind the constraints associated with the limited usage of AIs, the accuracy of AI tools, or the complexity of the developed scripts for automating the process. Due to the rapidly changing market for artificial intelligence, the validity of this study is limited to the current state of the tools. Similar studies will be necessary as AI tools continue to evolve.},

  abstract={In this paper, we explore memory and Schema through the lens of mathematical representation. By defining themes related to cognitive processes, we propose a compression algorithm that measures and retains important information of previous (historic) user-Generative AI interaction. Time and memory are interconnected via a decay mechanism, where context gets more abstract as time passes. At the same time, memories with thematic resemblance can be structured into Schemas using set theory, based on rules influenced by a maturity threshold. This threshold is determined by factors such as criticality, emotional-user interaction, and mass, which is the measure of the summation of related memories. Our approach reconstructs memories into reusable parameters and formulates Schemas, offering a foundation for more personalized and cost-effective human-GAI interactions.},

  abstract={This paper aims to find out how Generative AI models like GPT-3, when integrated with traditional teaching methods can enhance academic performance as well as the emotional well-being of students. Most of the digital education systems and tools only focus on curriculum delivery and fail to address the emotional states of students and their individual learning capabilities, this leads to the downfall of their academic progress and will yield poor learning outcomes. To address this issue, we have developed a system that analyzes the emotional states of students and then further categorizes them according to their learning pace (fast, medium, or slow). Our system works by first analyzing the survey responses collected from students using a scoring system that is predefined. Then it generates a personalized lesson plan tailored for each student according to the insights gained from the responses. With the integration of OpenAI's GPT-3 for the Lesson plan generation we ensure the content generated will be tailored specifically for each student's needs. Furthermore, it has been observed that using learning strategies that use AI-driven technology can create a more supportive and flexible educational environment which results in the student having better comprehension, motivation and increases academic success.},

The proposed system integrates the Vue.js and Laravel frameworks, together with a PHP (Hypertext preprocessor) Parser and the OpenAI API (Application programming interface), enabling dynamic, real-time optimization without necessitating system downtime. In contrast to conventional approaches that rely on offline environments or CI/CD (Continuous integration and continuous deployment) pipelines, this methodology facilitates continuous performance enhancement during active usage of web application. An experimental evaluation involving 20 functions within a Laravel application demonstrated a 70% optimization success rate, a 62.6% reduction in execution time and an 18.18% decrease in code lines. This approach preserves semantic consistency and provides reports to developers for further implementation. By reducing errors and enabling ongoing refinements, the work makes a significant contribution to the field of web application development.},

  abstract={One of the most impactful uses of Artificial Intelligence lies within the domain of text generation. Leveraging discoveries made from Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, and Large Language Models, text generation has rapidly integrated into modern life. It provides tools that allow anyone on the web to summarize materials, check grammar, and more. To navigate the progress generative text has undergone in the last couple of decades, this work examines a comprehensive review of research that addresses the fundamental components in building an effective model, ranging from the initial developments in algorithmic modules to the advent of neural networks. Then there is a further focuses on the challenges associated with such developments primarily in how the user interacts with the text, the responsiveness of the text, and the grammatical discrepancies between human & machine content. Accordingly, different tools and models are used to varying degrees of success in tackling these issues.},

  abstract={In the wave of technological innovation, generative artificial intelligence tools provide college students with personalized learning experience, promote autonomous learning and exploratory learning, and improve learning outcomes through intelligent tutoring and instant feedback. However, existing research shows that generative artificial intelligence tools still face multiple obstacles in practical application, such as differences in students' acceptance of new technologies, privacy protection challenges, and difficulties in integrating with the existing education system. This study is based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), a technology acceptance model, and specifically introduces perceived risk as a moderating variable. Combining key factors such as college students' cognitive characteristics and technological environment, this study constructs a theoretical model that affects college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools.The study found that performance expectations, effort expectations, social influence, and convenience conditions have a significant positive impact on college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools; effort expectations have a positive impact on performance expectations; convenience conditions have a positive impact on effort expectations; effort expectations mediate the relationship between convenience conditions and willingness to use; and perceived risk negatively moderates the impact of convenience conditions on willingness to use. It is expected that through this empirical study, the key factors that affect college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools will be deeply explored, and valuable suggestions and references will be provided for guiding technology optimization and education integration practices, which will help develop generative artificial intelligence tools that better meet the needs of college students and promote innovation and improvement of online education models.},

  abstract={This research work presents a groundbreaking approach at the intersection of neuroscience and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), focusing on the application of neuroscience techniques to neural networks, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs). Central to this study is the concept of ‘neural cluster knockout’ in LLMs, a method inspired by lesion studies in neuroscience involving the systematic removal of neuron clusters to decipher their role within the model. The research underscores the opaque nature of neural networks, particularly LLMs, which are often critiqued for their ‘black box’ operation. By adopting neuroscience principles, particularly lesion studies, this paper aims to illuminate the inner workings of neural networks, enhancing our understanding of their functionalities. This is crucial in an era increasingly reliant on AI in various sectors, where insights from this study could lead to the development of more efficient, transparent, and accountable AI systems. Methodologically, this study involved Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and neural cluster knockout through iterative zeroing, applied to the Large Language Model named LLaMA. This approach enabled the identification of significant neuron clusters and their functional impacts when deactivated. The results reveal both critical and redundant neurons within LLMs, demonstrating that some clusters are vital for accuracy, while others may impede efficiency or contribute to errors. This research contributes significantly to the AI field, offering a novel perspective on the intricate architecture of LLMs. It lays a foundation for future advancements in AI, envisioning refined and efficient LLMs capable of more accurate and reliable performance.},
