  abstract={With the development of artificial intelligence, the anomaly detection plays more and more important role in security monitoring field. Because it is difficult to label abnormal data, most of the supervised methods consumed a lot of manpower and obtained low performance and generality. Inspired by this motivation, this paper proposes a semi-supervised method for anomaly detection in video frames based on GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), in which only normal data was used as the training sample. The quality gap between the predicted frame and the ground truth is used as the basis to determine whether it is abnormal. Moreover, the mathematical morphology approach was adopted to locate the anomaly area in the frames. Experiments show that our method can successfully detect abnormal frames in video and can also locate the area where abnormal behavior occurs in frames.},

  pages={792-796},
  abstract={Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact technology for measuring human physiological indicators. The rPPG signal is extracted through the periodic changes of the facial skin in the facial video. The rPPG signal extracted by most existing rPPG methods has low quality, and it only can be used for average heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR), etc. But for the field of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, higher quality rPPG signals are needed. This paper introduces a novel and efficient generative adversarial network method defined as rPPGGAN, which denoises and enhances the original rPPG signal extracted by a deep learning rPPG method to make it closer to the real rPPG signal. The HRV indicators were verified on the public datasets UBFC-rPPG and PURE, and both the time-domain indicators and frequency-domain indicators have been effectively improved. The method proposed in this paper is lightweight, efficient, and easy to integrate. It can effectively improve the rPPG signal quality after being integrated with other rPPG methods.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly driving a new phase of artificial intelligence revolution, marked by various applications such as ChatGPT, Sora and DeepSeek. With powerful capabilities in content generation, personalization and user interaction, GenAI can drive significant enhancements in various mobile services to satisfy individual user preferences. Meanwhile, mobile services offer substantial support for accessibility, functionality and intelligence of GenAI applications. However, current research on integrating GenAI and mobile services remains nascent, lacking necessary theoretical and technical support. In this survey, we break down a new vision to guide research on integrating GenAI and mobile services, aiming to improve 6G intelligence levels and enable 6G mobile networks to support the integration of GenAI and mobile services effectively. We begin by examining the necessity of integrating GenAI with 6G mobile services and exploring potential learning architectures of GenAI models within mobile networks. Next, we analyze potential solutions from two perspectives: how 6G mobile networks empower GenAI and how GenAI enables mobile services. We subsequently explore a promising use case, along with essential features and techniques, to facilitate the integration of GenAI and mobile services. Finally, we discuss future research directions, aiming at realizing intelligent 6G networks.},

  title={Large Language Models: Ethics and Norms in the European Union}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1065-1070},
  abstract={This paper investigates the ethical-legal issues underlying the implementation of Large Language Models, in the aftermath of the European Union Parliament's approval of the Artificial Intelligence Regulation. In very recent years, there has been a rapid evolution and multiform implementation of the so-called Artificial Intelligence. Notably, one significant development in AI is the creation of systems capable of performing tasks based on a set of established rules. Artificial Intelligence has recently undergone a significant revolution that has led to a radical paradigm shift, represented by the so-called Foundation Models, which have two main characteristics: emergence and homogenisation. On the other hand, Language Modelling (LM) is one of the main approaches to advance the linguistic intelligence of machines and thus a Foundation Model trained on textual data. The most recent development of this approach can be found in the so-called Large Language Models (LLM). These take the form of artificial neural networks pre-trained on huge datasets which, instead of being dedicated to a specific task, can perform a wide range of different functions at a level that is all the more accurate the greater the resources made available to them. The concept of language models is not new but has evolved with the progress of artificial intelligence over the decades. In general, LLMs are mainly trained in industrial settings where many important details of training (e.g. data collection and cleaning) are not disclosed. Thus, it is difficult to align LLMs with human values or preferences. Despite their capabilities, LLMs are also likely to produce toxic, fictitious or harmful content. Therefore, effective and efficient control approaches are required to eliminate the potential risk arising from the use of LLMs. For the purposes of the study conducted, it is intended to describe the development and outcomes with the aim to show not only the evolution of the responses offered by various LLM, but also and above all the possible ethical and legal implications that can be deduced from these outputs. Several models have been used for the implementation of the experiments: two GPT-2 models, Perplexity, ChatGPT (version 3.5), Llama. The language used for the implementation of the experiments was English, as it is structurally more neutral. In particular, with reference to a topic with a strong ethical and legal impact such as suicide, different answers were offered by the various models used. In conclusion, the essay offers reflections on the results of the experiment with reference to the EU Regulation on Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence represents for the jurist, not only European, a decisive challenge not only with regard to the categories of thought and formulation of operational languages, but above all with regard to the centrality of the human being. On the basis of these considerations, focusing on generative AI and in particular on Large Language Models, it is clear that many of the issues relating to copyright and the protection of personal data still remain unsolved, excluding those already regulated by the legislation on the point.},

  abstract={In recent years, with the rapid development of social media, a large number of open-source emotion recognition datasets have emerged online, providing abundant resources for emotion recognition. Meanwhile, with the help of deep learning, multimodal emotion recognition technology has advanced rapidly. However, deep learning-based multimodal emotion recognition still has some drawbacks, such as requiring a large amount of training data, inconsistencies in the quantity and quality of data within datasets, and heterogeneity among different modalities in multimodal fusion. To address these issues, we propose a multimodal emotion recognition framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which enhances feature representation and reduces heterogeneity in multimodal fusion. Finally, we achieve promising experimental results on the RAVDESS dataset.},

  abstract={In this paper, the authors introduce an innovative methodology for automating backend code optimization, triggered from the frontend of a web application and powered by advanced generative AI models. The proposed system integrates the Vue.js and Laravel frameworks, together with a PHP (Hypertext preprocessor) Parser and the OpenAI API (Application programming interface), enabling dynamic, real-time optimization without necessitating system downtime. In contrast to conventional approaches that rely on offline environments or CI/CD (Continuous integration and continuous deployment) pipelines, this methodology facilitates continuous performance enhancement during active usage of web application. An experimental evaluation involving 20 functions within a Laravel application demonstrated a 70% optimization success rate, a 62.6% reduction in execution time and an 18.18% decrease in code lines. This approach preserves semantic consistency and provides reports to developers for further implementation.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a GAN-based multi-module fusion prediction model. By integrating multiple architectures-including a graph attention network, a Transformer encoder, and a temporal convolutional network-the model simultaneously optimizes spatial interactions, temporal dependencies, and trajectory feature modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with baseline methods such as CV, CS-LSTM, and TCN-LSTM, the proposed model significantly improves prediction accuracy by reducing the average displacement error and final displacement error by 24.38% and 14.46%, respectively, thereby fully validating its effectiveness in complex traffic scenarios.},

However, it is difficult to build labeled network flow data sets for training machine learning and deep learning models. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) powered generative adversarial network (GAN) model named NF-GAN for network flow generation. The generator of NF-GAN is designed as a stochastic policy model to generate labeled network flow data. In terms of the discriminator, a check reward is integrated into the network reward to capture the correlations among attributes. Experiment results demonstrate that the majority of the generated flows conform to the strict network protocols of the standard OSI stack, and the success rate of network flows generation achieves 99.96%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time of applying RL powered GAN on network flow generation tasks.},

  abstract={This exploratory analysis investigates the integration of ChatGPT in self-directed learning (SDL). Specifically, this study examines YouTube content creators’ language-learning experiences and the role of ChatGPT in their SDL, building upon Song and Hill's conceptual model of SDL in online contexts. Thematic analysis of interviews with 19 YouTubers and relevant video contents reveals distinct constructs of ChatGPT-integrated SDL, suggesting a reconceptualization and refinement of the SDL framework in the consideration of generative artificial intelligence (AI). This framework emphasizes critical aspects of utilizing ChatGPT as an SDL tool on two distinct levels: 1) the interactive relationships and interplay between learners’ personal traits and their ongoing learning processes (local) and 2) the evolving nature of SDL in the rapidly advancing landscape of generative AI, with socio-political-cultural foundations of AI constantly shaping the learning environment where SDL occurs (global). The study highlights the potential of ChatGPT as a tool for promoting self-directed language learning (SDLL) and provides implications for the development of learning technologies and research on AI-facilitated SDL.},

  abstract={Summary <p>The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) ushers in a new era of possibilities and efficiencies in how businesses can ideate, conceptualize, strategize, and develop marketing innovations. This chapter discusses how the readers can use AI and, specifically, generative AI to fuel the ideation processes. The results of specific ideation studies have shown AI&#x2010;generated ideas to be viable and on par with human&#x2010;generated ones. AI hallucinations can lead to unexpected, novel, and completely new ideas that break conventional thinking patterns. A common and useful scenario for using generative AI involves idea generation during a creative brainstorming process. A good starting point for combining human creativity with AI capabilities is to establish a prompt for both parties. The Creative Assistant tool augments human creativity, symbolizing the fusion of human ingenuity with AI capabilities. It empowers creators to continually enhance their presence on TikTok through perpetual ideation sessions.</p>},

  abstract={The rapid evolution of technology has transformed industries worldwide, revealing critical gaps in traditional educational approaches, particularly in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) including in the field of product development. Traditional academic frameworks often struggle to keep pace with industry demands, leaving some students underprepared for real-world challenges. This study identifies three core issues within STEM education: how to update curricula that lag technological advancements, limited opportunities for practical, hands-on application of skills, and constrained academic timeframes that limit the depth of transformative learning experiences.To address these issues, this research explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and Agile methodologies to bridge the gap between academic theory and industry practice in the field of product development. By examining two case studies - the development of an AI-driven media analysis tool for the United Nations International Computing Centre (UNICC) and AI-focused capstone projects within a Management and Systems graduate program. We show how applying Generative AI and Agile technologies can enhance curriculum relevance, expand real-world skill development opportunities, and optimize learning within semester-based time constraints. AI enables adaptive, personalized learning and automates routine tasks, while Agile’s iterative approach fosters engagement and adaptability in real-world problem-solving scenarios. AI is also a productive basis for product development in the integrative experience of a capstone. This research shows how combining AI and Agile provides an integrated framework for modernizing educational practices, equipping students with essential industry-relevant skills for a technology-driven workforce.},

  abstract={With the advancement of big data, the scope and potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have acquired major momentum. Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) is one of the most emergent fields of study in the current era of digitalization. Many examples have proven the effectiveness of Machine- and Deep Learning methods. In industrial production, however, limitations are still present that hinder application online and in a series that goes beyond isolated use cases. One crucial issue is data precondition, i.e., data quality, consistency, and labeling. As DCAI addresses these issues, developments in this field have caught the attention of various experts. In summary, DCAI continues to be an exciting and promising field of study that enhances AI applicability. Several research works have been conducted in DCAI, but unfortunately, no comprehensive reviews have been conducted to summarize and highlight the results. This gap in knowledge inspired our work, that aims to answer well-structured research questions. The focus of this paper is to clarify the terminology used in DCAI while also distinguishing it from other AI-related problems. This helps to analyze the current standards and problems associated with DCAI. This paper summarizes current use cases of DCAI and their impact on industries. Through this detailed description, readers can understand the potential and benefits of using DCAI in different business sectors. The analysis of the latest methods employed by DCAI to achieve enhanced AI performance and outcomes provides valuable insights for professionals and organizations that strive to incorporate AI into their business.},

  abstract={The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has increased drastically in recent years, offering transformative potential in creativity, productivity, and decision-making across various domains. However, concerns are growing among practitioners and academics about its tendency to produce inaccurate or nonsensical outputs—a phenomenon known as generative AI hallucinations. While scholars have begun exploring this phenomenon, most of the existing research focuses on technical issues and solutions. This research takes a behavioral approach to examine the association between individual personality traits and tolerance of generative AI hallucinations. Drawing on error management theory and the big five personality traits, we examine how individuals with different personality traits tolerate generative AI hallucinations. The study contributes to calls from management journals to investigate the challenges associated with generative AI use. Our findings provide important theoretical implications and offer actionable insights for engineering managers seeking to implement generative AI.},

  abstract={Recent advancements in AI, especially generative AI (gAI), are accelerating industrial digitalisation, with the market projected to grow significantly by 2030. However, challenges such as the black-box nature of AI decisions, biased data, and AI-generated hallucinations continue to hinder industrial trust. AI also requires better adaptability to dynamic environments and stronger accountability mechanisms. To address these challenges, this paper proposed an adaptive gAI-based multi-agent framework that enables collaboration between human actors and multiple AI agents, i.e. ExplainAgent, AuditAgent, RobustAgent and AutoAgent tailored to mirror and provide specialised support for the various aspects of trustworthy AI. Each of the agents will be clearly defined and specialised through the customisation of multiple modules encompassing 1) Communication and Cooperation, 2) Ensure Trust and 3) Execute and Evaluate Decisions. The framework focuses on improving explainability, fairness, and robustness while fostering human-AI collaboration with the aim of advancing trustworthy AI methods, tools and best practices leveraging AI and related technologies.},

Although most of camouflage patterns are generally created by randomly combining colors and various local shapes based on human subjectivity, it can be difficult to generate an appropriate camouflage pattern according to a specific background image. In this paper, we propose a method that can emergently generate complex camouflage patterns by using an Ant Painting algorithm. In the proposed method, after some features of an input image are extracted, artificial ants draws a camouflage according to the features. We demonstrate that, by interaction among ants, the proposed method can generate camouflage patterns which are more complex but blends better with the background image than random generation.},

  abstract={This paper explores the integration of ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art language model, in the domain of cultural heritage Artificial Intelligence-based e-learning, with a specific focus on the analysis and interpretation of lyrics and poems. Cultural heritage preservation and education have increasingly turned to Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to enhance learning experiences and promote the understanding and appreciation of diverse artistic expressions. We have conducted an initial empirical study on how ChatGPT can assist learners in analysing and interpreting poetic and lyrics works, offering insights into the historical, cultural, and literary significance embedded within the verses. Our findings highlight ChatGPT's significant potential but also major weaknesses with respect to poetry and lyrics. ChatGPT was found particularly good in the field of interpreting poetic content. Additionally, ChatGPT showed a very good performance in analogy identification, demonstrating a broad knowledge base encompassing various form of poetry, from Ancient Greek works to ecclesiastic hymns and modern compositions. However, opportunities for enhancement are evident in translation and historical context provision. Finally, ChatGPT's weakest aspect was its factual accuracy, occasionally producing errors without indicating uncertainty in its responses. Consequently, while ChatGPT displays substantial promise, its application in e-learning settings is not mature due to observed inaccuracies. Furthermore, we introduced MUSILYAN, a specialised software tool designed for musicological and lyrical analysis, complementing ChatGPT's capabilities. While Chat-GPT excels in natural language understanding and generation, MUSILYAN offers structured semantic content management and thematic organisation of lyrics. The integration of ChatGPT and MUSILYAN holds promise for enhancing the exploration and understanding of poetry and lyrics.},

  abstract={The emergence of deep learning at the beginning of the last decade has driven the advancement of complex models, culminating in the development of large language models and generative AI. These models represent the summit of size and complexity. Explainability should be an option that plays a key role in enabling understandable the AI-assisted decision-making and ensuring accountability. This contribution delves into the complexities of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) through various perspectives, considering the extensive and growing body of literature. Our discussion begins by addressing the challenges posed by complex data, models, and high-risk scenarios. Given the rapid growth of the field, it is essential to tackle the criticisms and challenges that emerge as it matures, requiring thorough exploration. This contribution explores them, along with three aspects that may shed light on them.

  abstract={As a specific category of artificial intelligence (AI), generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) generates new content that resembles what humans create. The rapid development of GenAI systems has created a huge amount of new data on the Internet, posing new challenges to current computing and communication frameworks. Currently, GenAI services rely on the traditional cloud computing framework due to the need for large computation resources. However, such services will encounter high latency because of data transmission and a high volume of user requests. On the other hand, edge-cloud computing can provide adequate computation power and low latency at the same time through the collaboration between edges and the cloud. Thus, it is attractive to build GenAI systems at scale by leveraging the edge-cloud computing paradigm. In this overview paper, we review recent developments in GenAI and edge-cloud computing, respectively. Then, we use two exemplary GenAI applications to discuss technical challenges in scaling up their solutions using edge-cloud collaborative systems. Finally, we list design considerations for training and deploying GenAI systems at scale and point out future research directions.},

  abstract={The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) is inevitable and significantly impacts our lives. Although AI has many positive benefits, some research results show that it cannot fully replicate the complexity and subjectivity of human intelligence and emotions. The research objective is to assess AI's effectiveness in visualizing product advertisements using Midjourney on social media. The research used a quantitative approach with an online questionnaire as an instrument to collect data from the millennial generation and Gen Z in Bandung City from March to June 2024. The results of the descriptive analysis revealed that Gen Z is quite familiar with AI-based advertising and has good knowledge about artificial intelligence and its use. Consequently, Gen Z can easily understand AI-based product advertising messages, leading to increased brand awareness and recall. Overall, most Gen Z responded positively to the Midjourney application as a valuable tool for designers in developing advertising ideas on social media and expressed interest in viewing other product advertising visualizations using AI technology.},

  year={2023},
  volume={18},
  number={4},
  pages={35-44},
  abstract={Aiming at achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the metaverse, pretrained foundation models (PFMs), e.g., generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), can effectively provide various artificial intelligence (AI) services, such as autonomous driving, digital twins (DTs), and AI-generated content (AIGC) for extended reality (XR). With the advantages of low latency and privacy-preserving, serving PFMs of mobile AI services in edge intelligence is a viable solution for caching and executing PFMs on edge servers with limited computing resources and GPU memory. However, PFMs typically consist of billions of parameters that are computation- and memory-intensive for edge servers during loading and execution. In this article, we investigate edge PFM serving problems for mobile AIGC services of the metaverse. First, we introduce the fundamentals of PFMs and discuss their characteristic fine-tuning and inference methods in edge intelligence. Then, we propose a novel framework of joint model caching and inference for managing models and allocating resources to satisfy users’ requests efficiently. Furthermore, considering the in-context learning ability of PFMs, we propose a new metric to evaluate the freshness and relevance between examples in demonstrations and executing tasks, namely the Age of Context (AoC). Finally, we propose a least-context (LC) algorithm for managing cached models at edge servers by balancing the tradeoff among latency, energy consumption, and accuracy.},

The successful implementation in real life of quantum computers are not easy because of limited quantum resources and access to quantum processors but instead of that there are different QGAN models for different purpose, such as drug discovery, finance, image generation and many more which shown good result as compare to their classical counterparts.

  abstract={This paper explores and envisions a collaboration between Facial Expression Recognition (FER) and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to create an advanced human-computer interaction (HCI) experience. Deep learning techniques are harnessed to interpret human emotions from facial expressions, using a structured approach that includes pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. The data acquired from the FER stage informs GenAI systems—such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs)—to produce contextually relevant and emotionally resonant responses. The proposed system leverages a sophisticated camera setup to capture facial data with high accuracy under diverse lighting conditions, ensuring robust and reliable emotion inference. Virtual avatars complete the multimodal experience by generating corresponding nonverbal cues. Special attention is given to creating a dynamic feedback loop for continuous learning and adaptation, leading to increasingly effective human-computer dialogues. Ethical implications, such as user privacy, data security, and bias mitigation, are central to the design and deployment of this system, underscoring the commitment to ethical standards and user empowerment. This paper aims to demonstrate how the convergence of FER and GenAI can revolutionize HCI, paving the way for enhanced empathetic and intelligent computing interfaces.},

  abstract={Generative diffusion models (GDMs) have emerged as potent tools for generating high-quality, creative content across various media, including audio, images, videos, and 3-D models. Their application in artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) marks a pivotal advancement in the evolution from the Internet of Things (IoT) to the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). Considering the inherent multiple-access nature of AIoT, training GDMs via federated learning and deploying them collaboratively is paramount. However, such approaches introduce considerable security risks and energy consumption challenges. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive architecture for GDMs, encompassing both training and sampling stages. This architecture, termed secure and sustainable diffusion (SS-Diff), aims to thwart trigger-based security threats, such as backdoor attacks and trojan attacks, while simultaneously reducing energy consumption in multiple-access AIoT. The SS-Diff architecture incorporates a dynamic quantization mechanism within the training phase, significantly reducing communication overhead and thereby improving both spectrum and energy efficiency. During the sampling stage, a detection-based defense strategy is employed to identify and negate trigger inputs associated with malicious attacks. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance of the SS-Diff architecture. The results demonstrate that the SS-Diff can effectively train GDMs and eliminate the impact of the attacks, compared with existing schemes.},

  abstract={In the Internet of Things era, the Internet demands extremely high-speed communication and data transformation. To this end, the tactile Internet has been proposed as a medium that provides the sense of touch ability, facilitating data transferability with extra-low latency in various applications ranging from industry, robotics, and healthcare to road traffic, education, and culture. Here, programmable networks are role players in approaching the tactile Internet’s low latency (≈ 1ms) pillar. Several functionalities – including security – are offloaded onto the network core employing programmable in-network pipelines. From the security perspective, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is another role player that enables the line-rate inference on the core network without involving the control plane. However, integrating AI-based security solutions in programmable devices is challenging mainly because of their constrained anatomy. Furthermore, such solutions inherit well-known adversarial AI vulnerabilities, representing an additional threat to programmable networks. Considering the above, this article discusses AI-based security solutions in programmable networks, focusing on the explored modalities of integrating AI models in programmable constrained network devices. Moreover, we elaborate on the challenges and risks of relying on AI for such mechanisms. Lastly, the article brings a visionary glimpse for future trends in this regard, raising some essential questions on the indispensability of AI for security functionalities and providing some alternative solutions.},

This has given rise to a new field of AI research, explainable AI (XAI). In this article, we present a survey of XAI characteristics and properties. We provide an indepth review of XAI themes, and describe the different methods for designing and developing XAI systems, both during and post model-development. We include a detailed taxonomy of XAI goals, methods, and evaluation, and sketch the major milestones in XAI research. An overview of XAI for security and cybersecurity of XAI systems is also provided. Open challenges are delineated, and measures for evaluating XAI system robustness are described.},

  abstract={A chatbot is equally vital if its purpose and objective are known. Chatbots are commonly used in marketing, sales, and customer service. Artificial Intelligence has been with us since the first half of the twentieth century. Due to hardware limitations at that time, computers could not execute and store commands. Because of the fast pace of technology, both storing and executing flourished, and so came the birth of artificial intelligence. This study aims to explore how artificial intelligence affects customer relations by discussing different kinds of chatbots. It briefly outlines how integrating chatbots or conversational AI significantly affects how customers behave in the retail business. Incorporating human characteristics into conversational agents drives the design of generative AI chatbots. Studies indicate that more work has to be done to improve chatbot performance. Improvements include reducing the chatbot's usage of cliches and enabling users to approach conversations sincerely. Studies indicate that more work has to be done to improve chatbot performance. Circling back to the anthropomorphism theory, trust in chatbots and chatbot overload further significantly impact service evaluation and customer purchase.},

  abstract={Nowadays, IoT devices have a remarkable place in daily life activities. Because of their wide application scope, cyber-attacks have started to increase as causing a critical issue in terms of data security. Because of this, some analyses within IoT network environments should be done for prevention and detection purposes. At this point, it is also important to train users to establish an awareness about cyber threats for IoT and how to analyze network environments in case of unexpected situations. This paper introduces a Web platform, which provides some IoT security scenarios to learn about how to understand / detect cyber threats and test their knowledge. In detail, the platform uses a synthetic dataset of network data pointing malicious or benign network activities. The dataset was generated by Generative Adversarial Networks, which was fed by some original network traffic datasets. Thanks to the synthetic dataset, the platform is able to provide tests or scenarios for randomly chosen network traffic data so that users can learn and test their skills in terms of IoT security. The applications revealed that GAN was successful enough to generate synthetic traffic datasets and the users were positive about their experiences with the developed Web platform.},

  abstract={The integration of more sensory and actuation components to the Smart Grid produces high volume of data. Consequently, this big data stretches the transmission, processing, and storage capabilities of the Smart Grid infrastructures. The vulnerability of advanced metering infrastructures (AMIs) is on the rise, as more devices are connected to the Internet these days. The aforementioned realities have continued to necessitate a debate on the future of cloud-centered artificial intelligence (AI) services for latency-sensitive user-centric IoT applications. It is rapidly becoming necessary to leverage on the applicability of EdgeAI directly on IoT sensory nodes involved in energy metering. This paper proposes the applicability of Artificial Intelligence situated on smart meter, to perform micro analytics at the edge of AMI networks: Artificial Intelligence of Things. Therefore, a functional AMI model based on IoT and EdgeAI is presented herein. Additionally, an integration architecture for the anticipated Smart Grid based on IoT and EdgeAI is presented.

However, few studies have explored the relationship between learning motivation, GAI technology acceptance, and learning outcomes. A total of 313 pre-service teachers were recruited at N Normal University in China. Questionnaire methods were used for data collection. The results of the structural equation show that: (1) GAI technology acceptance significantly predicted the learning outcomes, while the GAI use behavior did not. (2) Intrinsic motivation significantly predicted the GAI technology acceptance, while extrinsic motivation did not. (3) GAI technology acceptance plays a mediating role between the relationship of intrinsic motivation and learning outcomes.

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI), including large language models and generative AI, is emerging as a significant force in software development, offering developers powerful tools that span the entire development lifecycle. Although software engineering research has extensively studied AI tools in software development, the specific types of interactions between developers and these AI-powered tools have only recently begun to receive attention. Understanding and improving these interactions has the potential to enhance productivity, trust, and efficiency in AI-driven workflows. In this paper, we propose a taxonomy of interaction types between developers and AI tools, identifying eleven distinct interaction types, such as auto-complete code suggestions, command-driven actions, and conversational assistance. Building on this taxonomy, we outline a research agenda focused on optimizing AI interactions, improving developer control, and addressing trust and usability challenges in AI-assisted development. By establishing a structured foundation for studying developer-AI interactions, this paper aims to stimulate research on creating more effective, adaptive AI tools for software development.},

  pages={326-331},
  abstract={This study addresses the limitations of traditional prescribed meal plans, which lack personalization and often prove monotonous and challenging for patients to follow. We propose a novel approach employing generative artificial intelligence in the context of a learning health system, with an emphasis on inpatient clinical dietetics. The system incorporates two key models: the Meal Plan Generation Model, MeaIGM, and the Meal Plan Image Generation Model, MealImageGM, leveraging state-of-the-art large language models. Patient information from electronic health records and clinical dietetics guidelines are incorporated into prompts for MeaIGM, which is refined through nutritionist validations and users' feedback. On the other hand, MealImageGM generates visual representations of meal plans to enhance patient engagement, utilizing crowd-sourced feedback to optimize image generation prompts. The overall system process includes extracting data from electronic health records, pre-designed user meal generation prompts, and the generation of personalized meal plans and images. Nutritionists play a crucial role in monitoring patient adherence and preferences, contributing to a continuous learning health system cycle. The proposed framework ensures clinically appropriate and personalized meal plans, aligning with dynamic dietary recommendations. The study emphasizes the importance of patient-physician co-creation for constant optimization and highlights the potential positive impact on health outcomes.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology that finds its application in various industries. Integration of AI in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can lead to tremendous growth in the field of UAVs by improving flight safety and efficiency. Machine learning algorithms can enable UAVs to make real-time decisions in complex environments and reach the optimal solution that aims to fulfill a mission's requirements within the hardware constraints such as battery and payload. Several recent works in UAVs employed a variety of machine learning algorithms to enhance the capabilities of UAVs and assist them. Although several reviews have been published examining the various aspects of AI for UAVs, they are all pertaining to particular applications or technologies. Addressing this research gap, we present a comprehensive and diversified review to enable researchers to analyze the current and future requirements and develop the latest solutions utilizing AI. We have classified the reviewed works based on three different classification schemes: 1) application scenario-based, 2) AI algorithm-based, and 3) AI training paradigm-based. We have also presented a compilation of frameworks, tools, and libraries used in AI-integrated UAV systems. We identified that the integration of AI in UAVs has a wide array of applications ranging from path planning to resource allocation. We have observed that Reinforcement Learning based algorithms are more often used in AI-integrated UAV systems than other AI algorithms. Further, our findings reveal that UAV frameworks employing federated learning and other distributed machine learning paradigms are quickly emerging. Furthermore, we also have put forth several challenges and potential applications of AI-integrated UAV systems.},

  pages={253-259},
  abstract={This research work presents a groundbreaking approach at the intersection of neuroscience and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), focusing on the application of neuroscience techniques to neural networks, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs). Central to this study is the concept of ‘neural cluster knockout’ in LLMs, a method inspired by lesion studies in neuroscience involving the systematic removal of neuron clusters to decipher their role within the model. The research underscores the opaque nature of neural networks, particularly LLMs, which are often critiqued for their ‘black box’ operation. By adopting neuroscience principles, particularly lesion studies, this paper aims to illuminate the inner workings of neural networks, enhancing our understanding of their functionalities. This is crucial in an era increasingly reliant on AI in various sectors, where insights from this study could lead to the development of more efficient, transparent, and accountable AI systems. Methodologically, this study involved Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and neural cluster knockout through iterative zeroing, applied to the Large Language Model named LLaMA. This approach enabled the identification of significant neuron clusters and their functional impacts when deactivated. The results reveal both critical and redundant neurons within LLMs, demonstrating that some clusters are vital for accuracy, while others may impede efficiency or contribute to errors. This research contributes significantly to the AI field, offering a novel perspective on the intricate architecture of LLMs. It lays a foundation for future advancements in AI, envisioning refined and efficient LLMs capable of more accurate and reliable performance.},

  abstract={The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought about significant societal changes, necessitating robust AI governance frameworks. This study analyzed the research trends in AI governance within the framework of the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act). This study conducted a bibliometric analysis to examine the publications indexed in the Web of Science database. Our findings reveal that research on AI governance, particularly concerning AI systems regulated by the EU AI Act, remains relatively limited compared to the broader AI research landscape. Nonetheless, a growing interdisciplinary interest in AI governance is evident, with notable contributions from multi-disciplinary journals and open-access publications. Analysis of publications per country revealed that while the United States and China dominate AI governance research, European countries, along with the United Kingdom, also contribute significantly with a focus on specific systems restricted by the Act. Dominant research themes include ethical considerations, privacy concerns, and the growing impact of generative AI, such as ChatGPT. Notably, education, healthcare, and worker management are prominent application domains. Keyword network analysis highlights education, ethics, and ChatGPT as central keywords, underscoring the importance of these areas in current AI governance research. Subsequently, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken based on the bibliometric analysis findings to identify research trends, challenges, and insights within the categories of the EU AI Act. This review revealed critical gaps in research concerning regulated AI systems, highlighting the need for more focused research aligned with the Act’s regulatory framework. The findings provide valuable insights for researchers and policymakers, informing future research directions and contributing to developing comprehensive AI governance frameworks beyond the EU AI Act. Crucially, the study identifies a significant lag between AI technological advancement and the development of policy and regulation, especially concerning specific AI systems categorized as high-risk by the EU AI Act.},

  abstract={One of the most innovative ways to identify liver cancer is using deep learning. In medical image analysis, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) reliably detect potential tumors in CT, MRI, and ultrasonography. The potential for improved patient outcomes and early detection is great with this research. The use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to interpret time-series data, including blood tests, offers an alternate method. RNNs may help with early risk prediction and personalized monitoring plan development. The interpretability of AI models, data quality, and seamless integration into healthcare processes are still problems, though. Advances in data synthesis, explainable AI (XAI), and userfriendly interfaces are addressing these challenges. Future prospects appear bright thanks to emerging technologies like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and customized medical approaches that leverage several data sources. Collaboration between researchers, healthcare providers, and technology companies is necessary to accelerate innovation and ensure that it is more broadly available.},

  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is an important technology employed in a variety of different applications, such as transportation, healthcare, and manufacturing. In recent years, the number of IoT devices deployed globally has been increasing at a rapid pace and is estimated to reach 20 billion by the end of 2025. In modern industry, IoT plays a pivotal role by monitoring the condition of industrial machines and, consequently, improving the efficiency of industrial processes. To optimize the efficiency of industrial IoT applications, various Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been adopted, leading to a new computing paradigm, namely, Industrial Artificial Intelligence of Things (i.e. Industrial AIoT). In this paper, we describe the challenges to tackle and the opportunities to explore in Industrial AIoT. Specifically, we first review the use of state-of-the-art AI methods in Industrial AIoT applications, with a focus on Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques.

  abstract={In current trends, poetry is a creative expression of thoughts and emotions which manifesting as sequences of words to express ideas in an imaginative style for Automatic generation of poetry. Natural Language Generation (NLG) and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) generally create a new poem. But the generative AI has lack of poem originality, has limited content which is failed in generating deeper information on the related topic and heavily struggling to create the new concepts with sequential words. To overcome these issues, the model of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 with fine tuning (GPT-2-FT) is proposed which is coherent for adapting various forms and contexts to avoid nonsensical sequence of text words. Initially, Poem Generation dataset is used, then in preprocessing, input tokens are divided into different individual words and gives it as input to training words. The proposed GPT-2-FT gives an accurate value and also handles the emotions of poem by Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which including generator and discriminator. The proposed GPT-2-FT gives improved results in terms of Coherence, accuracy and fluency which values are given by (8.777), (0.998) and (0.975) respectively than existing Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) model.},

  year={2019},

  pages={111-118},
  abstract={Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, as the core technology in Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, such as self-driving vehicles, make important decisions by performing a variety of data classification or prediction tasks. Attacks on data or algorithms in AI applications can lead to misclassification or misprediction, which can fail the applications. For each dataset separately, the parameters of ML algorithms should be tuned to reach a desirable classification or prediction accuracy. Typically, ML experts tune the parameters empirically, which can be time consuming and does not guarantee the optimal result. To this end, some research suggests an analytical approach to tune the ML parameters for maximum accuracy. However, none of the works consider the ML performance under attack in their tuning process. This paper proposes an analytical framework for tuning the ML parameters to be secure against attacks, while keeping its accuracy high. The framework finds the optimal set of parameters by defining a novel objective function, which takes into account the test results of both ML accuracy and its security against attacks. For validating the framework, an AI application is implemented to recognize whether a subject's eyes are open or closed, by applying k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm on her Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this application, the number of neighbors (k) and the distance metric type, as the two main parameters of kNN, are chosen for tuning. The input data perturbation attack, as one of the most common attacks on ML algorithms, is used for testing the security of the application. Exhaustive search approach is used to solve the optimization problem. The experiment results show k = 43 and cosine distance metric is the optimal configuration of kNN for the EEG dataset, which leads to 83.75% classification accuracy and reduces the attack success rate to 5.21%.},

  abstract={Data-driven application deployment imposes needs for distributed cloud databases that need to handle extensive data quantities efficiently as they provide guarantee and scaling properties and operational performance. Distributed databases now benefit from advanced capabilities enabled by AI systems that promote better database operation and scalability capacity. This research explores the integration of generative artificial intelligence systems with distributed cloud databases to solve database query optimization challenges while managing operational workloads and making fault predictions and ensuring data consistency initiatives. Through our research on generative AI's predictive functions and generative capabilities we formulate innovative techniques that connect automated schema design and adaptive indexing with intelligent data partitioning approaches. Generative AI reveals new capabilities in anomaly prevention that escalate system dependability and slash operational interruptions. The framework implements reinforcement learning and transformers to acquire performance database data which subsequently exploits this information to generate outcomes that coincide with adjusting workload patterns. Experimental results beyond cloud database benchmark testing validate higher query execution performance together with strengthened system resource capacity and accelerated performance. The research incorporates ethical considerations along with privacy analysis while making key points to determine suitable AI deployment in cloud environments. Research demonstrates that generative AI changes distributed cloud database procedures by enabling scalable efficient intelligent operational database management systems.

  abstract={To enhance teaching practices and lecture strategies, online lecturers need reliable and opportunity feedback. Post-observation feedback provides opportunities for reflection, dialogue, development, and helping lecturers to improve their teaching practices. However, this poses a significant challenge in online higher education due to traditional observation procedures requiring previously trained observers, rendering them expensive and time-consuming. In addition, the observation process has human biases such as those introduced in annotated data by trained observers. Automated solutions powered by Artificial Intelligence offer a viable alternative providing consistency and affordability, delivering actionable feedback to lecturers, thereby helping to improve their pedagogical techniques and supporting student success. Hence, analyzing the video conferencing of the lecturers in online courses would help provide feedback to instructors and insights about teaching practices to institutional leadership. Therefore, this Work in Progress describes a proof of concept on a speech processing pipeline for providing post-observation feedback using Generative Artificial Intelligence to support the reflection process about online higher education teachers' practices.},
