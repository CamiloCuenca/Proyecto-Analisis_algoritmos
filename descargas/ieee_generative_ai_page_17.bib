  abstract={The Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) seam-lessly interconnects wearable devices on the human body, facilitating the monitoring of various physiological parameters for better health outcomes. Ensuring the accuracy and security of data transmission is paramount to prevent false alarms and maintain the overall reliability of WBANs. In response to these challenges, we propose a cutting-edge solution, the WBAN-GAN model. This innovative approach integrates a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to assist in the detection of anomalies within WBANs. We have employed a convolutional neural network with a lookback in the data to design our generator and discriminator to explore the spatiotemporal correlations in detecting anomalies. In this work, we fully utilize the outputs of both the generator and discriminator in identifying anomalies by calculating the anomaly score using reconstruction error and discriminator output. To the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done using GANs for anomaly detection in WBANs. To validate the efficacy of our WBAN-GAN model, we conducted extensive testing using the MIMIC dataset [11]. Comparative analysis with a CNN-Autoencoder-based anomaly detection model demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed approach. Our results show an accuracy of 97% in detecting the anomalies.},

  abstract={The manufacturing process must continuously be improved. One of the most efficient strategies is maintenance scheduling by predictive maintenance for early fault detection and assisting with real-time decisions. The major concern of developing a predictive maintenance system is the lack of abnormal data and the cost of a high-specification sensor device for collecting data. This paper introduces the unsupervised learning model called Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating abnormal data in the form of acceleration signals to provide a dataset for developing an early fault prediction model and assisting a real-time decision on a low-frequency sensor device. The prediction model dataset is labeled on IS010816 to classify the label of data by Velocity Vibration (mm/s). The machine learning classifier model implements a hyperparameters optimization framework called OPTUNA to provide the best model performance. The proposed system aims to assist in real-time decision and maintenance schedules for the injection molding machine and offer the prediction model based on low-frequency sensor data from a drive motor.},

  abstract={Underwater images will be distorted due to the influence of turbulence, and images will appear geometric distortion since the light is refracted by the turbulence, which makes task of image recognition difficult. In order to improve image recognition underwater, this paper proposes an image restoration method using underwater distorted image sequence through deep learning technique. Considering the complexity of dynamics motion, image sequence is more feasible to realize task of restoration, which contains enough information of water turbulence.

  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={545-549},
  abstract={Recently, most existing single image dehazing methods adopt the physical scattering model to generate clear images. The model variables are often estimated by trainable neural networks. However, estimating the variables heavily rely on dataset that usually does not take into account of the physical process induced by the scattering model. In this scheme, error accumulation cannot be avoided when applying the end-to-end methods. In this paper, we propose a physical constraint generative adversarial network (PHC-GAN) for single image dehazing. The PHC-GAN is a physics aware model that leveraging the physical scattering process as an additional constraint. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first introducing physical constraint in learning an end-to-end image dehazing model. Our proposed model not only effectively reduce the error accumulation, but can be well adapted in complex and realistic natural scenes compared to the existing methods. In detail, we realize the physical constraint in terms of a double discriminator architecture. The self-attention module is also utilized to guarantee fast convergence. In experiments, quantitative and qualitative results on both synthetic and natural images demonstrate that PHC-GAN is superior to state-of-the-art dehazing methods.},

  abstract={Super-Resolution (SR) refers to increasing the resolution of a signal in a variety of ways, conventionally employed in the field of image enhancement. Compared with the endeavors for super-resolution in image processing, music signals require supper-resolution to improve their quality or adapt to communication in narrow-band channel, which is also regarded as bandwidth expansion. To this end, we shed light on super-resolution for music signals using the deep learning strategy of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The proposed approach feeds Shot-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) features of low-band signals to the GAN, expecting to obtain their high-band information through jointly considering content and adversarial losses. Then, we carry out experiments on MUSDB18 dataset using mixtures of music sources, in order to show the performance of the proposed approach. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach achieves better super-resolution performances compared with interpolation and some conventional deep-learning strategies.},

  abstract={To address the problems that existing recognition networks rely on a large amount of labeled data and the perceptual field is limited to the local area of convolution, and the lack of understanding of contextual information, this paper proposes a self-attentive semantic segmentation method based on generative adversarial networks. The method is based on generating adversarial networks, constructing semantic segmentation networks and discriminators, where the semantic segmentation network uses Resnet101 as the backbone to connect the spatial pyramid pooling module of PSPNet and adopts the cross-attention method in order to overcome the problem of too many parameters of classical attention models. The model was simulated in the publicly available PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, and the results showed that the MIoU of the model reached 73.1%, 74.4%, and 75.1% for 1/8, 1/4, and 1/2 with labels, respectively, in the first semi-supervised experiments without improving the segmentation network compared to the control group, which were 3.6%, 2.3%, and 1.3% higher, respectively. The MIoU value reached 75.4% after improving the segmentation network, which proved the superiority and effectiveness of this model.},

  pages={1-4},
  abstract={In the process of acquiring medical images, the quality of the acquired medical images may be poor due to various reasons, thus leading to the doctor's wrong judgement of the patient's condition. In order to solve the problem of unclear texture and blurred edges in medical image storage, an improved generative adversarial network for super-resolution reconstruction of medical images is proposed. Inspired by the Res2Net network, the generator of SRGAN is improved and a multi-scale feature fusion module is designed as the backbone feature extraction network of the generator. This module represents the image multiscale features at the granularity level and expands the receptive field of each network layer to fully extract the feature information of the image. Meanwhile, the EMA attention is embedded into the multiscale feature fusion module, which improves the ability of the model to process features and enhances the feature representation by reorganising the dimensionality of the channels and the batch dimensions, and using the interaction of the different dimensions to capture the connection between image pixels. The results show that at a magnification of 4, this paper's method has better results in objective evaluation criteria compared to SRResNet and SRGAN. It can be seen that the algorithm in this paper can enhance the texture details of medical images and obtain better visual effects.},

  pages={294-299},
  abstract={The engine vibration of the gasoline-powered unmanned helicopter induces motion blur in the images acquired by the onboard camera, degrading the performance of visual tasks such as target identification and visual navigation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-scale feature fusion deblurring algorithm based on a generative adversarial network (GAN). The algorithm utilizes different scales of image features to enhance both semantic and detailed information in the images. Additionally, a frequency selection method is employed to extract useful frequency information from the blurred images, further improving the deblurring effect. Experimental validation is conducted on the publicly available GoPro dataset, where the results demonstrate that the algorithm achieves a PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) of 32.24dB and an SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) of 0.934. Furthermore, the algorithm is tested on a dataset captured by the gasoline-powered unmanned helicopter, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing target identification performance for motion-blurred images. This finding provides strong support for the visual task capabilities of gasoline-powered unmanned helicopters.},

  abstract={Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, as a tool for recording cardiac activity, are widely used for the detection and diagnosis of heart diseases. However, challenges in data imbalance limit the performance of automatic detection models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), as a data augmentation technique, can effectively address these issues. In this paper, we propose a progressive training strategy aimed at preserving the details of ECG signals while ensuring the stability of model training. This strategy helps progressively generate signals by gradually increasing the resolution of template signals, from coarse to fine. Additionally, we employ GANs with the proposed strategy to generate atrial fibrillation (AF) signals and evaluate the similarity between the generated signals and real signals. We further build an ECG signal classification network and evaluate the impact of the generated signals on the performance of the classification network.},

  abstract={In response to the substantial threat that Internet attacks pose to data center network security, researchers have proposed several deep learning-based methods for detecting network intrusions. However, while algorithms are constantly improving in terms of accuracy, their stability in the face of insufficient attack samples is a major obstacle. To solve the issues of insufficient attack samples and low detection accuracy in network intrusion detection, this paper proposes a deep confidence network intrusion detection method G-DBN based on GAN. The model is based on the malicious sample extension of the generative adversarial network, and it can produce adversarial samples using malicious network flows as original samples. Furthermore, this paper uses deep belief network technology to create and assess the efficacy of the G-DBN model in detecting network attacks, comparing it to standard DBN models and other network intrusion detection techniques. Experimental results show that compared to the standard three-layer DBN method, the G-DBN method described in this paper improves the detection accuracy of attack samples by 6.46% and better meets the performance requirements of current practical applications.},

  abstract={When classifying hyperspectral images, the limited number of samples will make classifier training difficult. Cross-domain information can help solve the problem of insufficient training samples. Cross-domain classification problem is discussed in this paper. In the problem, one scene with sufficient labeled samples is called source scene, and the other with limited training samples is called target scene. However, due to the changes in the imaging condition, the source scene and the target scene usually contain different feature distributions. This paper proposes a heterogeneous transfer learning method for cross-domain hyperspectral image classification based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). The method consists of two submodules: classification submodule composed of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and scene alignment submodule that helps in reducing the domain shift between different datasets with a generator and a discriminator. The experimental results on two cross-domain hyperspectral image datasets reveal the excellent competitiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Sentiment analysis is considered as an important study where be able to automatically extract the polarity of consumers or users' opinions and use it as important data for decision-making in companies or organizations. It has further developed into Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis research that predicts the polarity for a specific aspect within a sentence. Recently, research has been conducted to convert emotion analysis based on classification work to a model that obtains more diverse and accurate emotion expressions using generative language models. We propose a method of fine-tuning by introducing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into a generative language model to improve the performance of these generative-based ABSA models and enable efficient learning. In this paper, GloABSA (GPT2+LoRA Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis) aims at improving the learning efficiency of the previously proposed GPTABSA model. In this study, LoRA is introduced and fine-tuned to the GPT2 model to predict aspects and polarities using enhanced contextual information, and to reduce the number of parameters to enable efficient learning. Experiments using a benchmark dataset of ABSA, let us show that our proposed method outperforms previous studies and significantly reduces the number of parameters.},

  abstract={Deep neural networks (DNN) are widely used in various fields and get great success, but one of the major challenges is interpretable mechanism of DNN model. In order to break through the limitations of current deep learning, especially for the interpretability problem of DNN models, we will give a physics-based interpretation of the DNN model in this work. Due to the relationship among autoencoder, minimum description length, mutual information, Ising model, renormalization group etc and free energy principle in deep learning, the energy-based learning framework provides some solid foundations for interpretable DNN model. Therefore, based on the least action principle, the interpretation for generative models using physics principle is presented, and the interpretability problem of DNN model is investigated. Our proposed Synergetic Learning Systems (SLS) is an artificial intelligence (AI) system with multiple subsystems. Here we take two-model SLS, one is the reductive model and another is evolutionary model, as an example to illuminate the interpretability of the DNN models. This work is significant as it offers a clear physical perspective on interpretable DNNs, paves the road for the development of physical artificial intelligence, and prompts development of Science for AI greatly.},

  title={Data Augmentation for Sparse Multidimensional Learning Performance Data Using Generative AI}, 
  year={2025},

  number={},
  pages={145-164},
  abstract={Learning performance data, such as correct or incorrect answers and problem-solving attempts in intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs), facilitate the assessment of knowledge mastery and the delivery of effective instructions. However, these data tend to be highly sparse (80%$\sim$90% missing observations) in most real-world applications. This data sparsity presents challenges to using learner models to effectively predict learners' future performance and explore new hypotheses about learning. This article proposes a systematic framework for augmenting learning performance data to address data sparsity. First, learning performance data can be represented as a 3-D tensor with dimensions corresponding to learners, questions, and attempts, effectively capturing longitudinal knowledge states during learning. Second, a tensor factorization method is used to impute missing values in sparse tensors of collected learner data, thereby grounding the imputation on knowledge tracing (KT) tasks that predict missing performance values based on real observations. Third, data augmentation using generative artificial intelligence models, including generative adversarial network (GAN), specifically vanilla GANs and generative pretrained transformers (GPTs, specifically GPT-4o), generate data tailored to individual clusters of learning performance. We tested this systemic framework on adult literacy datasets from AutoTutor lessons developed for adult reading comprehension. We found that tensor factorization outperformed baseline KT techniques in tracing and predicting learning performance, demonstrating higher fidelity in data imputation, and the vanilla GAN-based augmentation demonstrated greater overall stability across varying sample sizes, whereas GPT-4o-based augmentation exhibited higher variability, with occasional cases showing closer fidelity to the original data distribution. This framework facilitates the effective augmentation of learning performance data, enabling controlled, cost-effective approach for the evaluation and optimization of ITS instructional designs in both online and offline environments prior to deployment, and supporting advanced educational data mining and learning analytics.},

  title={Believe in Artificial Intelligence? A User Study on the ChatGPT’s Fake Information Impact}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={11},
  number={4},
  pages={5168-5177},
  abstract={Technological evolution has enabled the development of new artificial intelligence (AI) models with generative capabilities. Among them, one of the most discussed is the virtual agent ChatGPT. This chatbot may occasionally produce fake information, as also declared by the producer OpenAI. Such a model may provide very useful support in several tasks, ranging from text summarization to programming. The research community has marginally investigated the impact that fake information created by AI models has on the users’ perceptions and on their belief in AI. We analyzed the impact of the fake information produced by AI on user perceptions, specifically trust and satisfaction, by performing a user study on ChatGPT. An additional issue is assessing whether the early or late knowledge of the possibility of the tool generating fake information has a different impact on the users’ perceptions. We conducted an experiment, involving 62 university students, a category of users who may employ tools such as ChatGPT extensively. The experiment consisted of a guided interaction with ChatGPT. Some of the participants experienced the failure of the chatbot, while a control group only received correct and reliable answers. We collected participants’ perceptions of trust, satisfaction, and usability, together with the net promoter score (NPS). The results demonstrated a statistically significant difference in trust and satisfaction between the users who early experienced fake information production compared to those who discovered ChatGPT’s faulty behaviors later during the interaction. Also, there is no statistically significant difference among the users who received the late fake information and the control group (no fake information). Usability and the NPS also resulted higher when the fake news was detected in the late interaction. When users are aware of the fake information generated by ChatGPT their trust and satisfaction decrease, especially when they impact on this at the early stage of use of the chatbot.

  abstract={The importance of Radio Access Network (RAN) in support Artificial Intelligence (AI) application services has grown significantly, underscoring the need for an integrated approach that considers not only network efficiency but also AI performance. In this paper we focus on a semantic generative communication (SGC) framework for image inpainting application. Specifically, the transmitter sends semantic information, i.e., semantic masks and textual descriptions, while the receiver utilizes a conditional diffusion model on a base image, using them as conditioning data to produce the intended image. In this framework, we propose a bandwidth allocation scheme designed to maximize bandwidth efficiency while ensuring generation performance. This approach is based on our finding of a “Semantic Deadline”-the minimum time that conditioning data is required to be injected to meet a given performance threshold-within the multi-modal SGC framework. Given this observation, the proposed scheme allocates limited bandwidth so that each semantic information can be transmitted within the corresponding semantic deadline. Experimental results corroborate that the proposed bandwidth allocation scheme achieves higher generation performance in terms of PSNR for a given bandwidth compared to traditional schemes that do not account for semantic deadlines.},

  abstract={Amongst many life-threatening conditions, a fatal condition is the Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). It may result in death if not treated immediately and hence necessitates the need for accurate diagnosis for effective treatment. In recent times, concepts of Artificial intelligence (AI), have emerged as a transformative tool in medical image processing, offering faster and more reliable ICH detection and classification. This research study reviews the current advancements in AI-driven biomedical image processing for ICH, exploring various state-of-the-art models involving Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), variants of CNN with more efficient feature extraction procedures, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and optimization methods like Genetic Algorithms (GA), Ant Colony Model (ACO), rParticle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Additionally, challenges such as data scarcity, model interpretability, and generalization across diverse populations are discussed. The paper highlights future research directions, including the need for explainable AI, multimodal data integration, and real-time, low-cost AI solutions for resourceconstrained environments. By addressing these challenges, AI has the potential to revolutionize ICH detection and improve patient outcomes globally.},

  abstract={Advancements in smartphone technology have led to an increase in the usage of various location-based services (LBS). This resulted in a lot of trajectory data being generated. LBSs provide personalized services for users through continuous queries. However, there is a problem that the user’s sensitive information can be inferred through such continuous queries. Although various methods have been proposed to protect personal information, traditional personal information protection methods cannot provide absolute personal information protection when user location information itself, such as LBS, is required. In particular, if sensitive points visited by the user are exposed, this may lead to additional information leakage. Therefore, this paper guarantees anonymity by protecting sensitive points visited by users through the class conditional synthesis of ACGAN, and proposes a synthetic trajectory generation model for generating highly useful trajectory data through the combination of attention mechanisms. Furthermore, the usability and anonymity aspects of the synthetic trajectory data generated by the proposed are compared with those of existing models to verify the performance of the proposed.},

  abstract={Micro-computed tomography (CT) imagining is an advanced technology that has been commonly adapted to scan three-dimensional images of small animals and small structures. Micro CT has a wide variety of applications in medical science, medical research, material science, etc. Micro CT provides low-dose scanning to ensure that the scanning material is safe and the radiation explosion is low. Although it is a low-dose scanning method, the quality of the scanned image will be somewhat degraded. In the specialized domain of image processing, we see enormous triumph in the regions of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) as well, with the capacity to deal with even the most difficult operations like reconstruction, enhancement, segmentation, etc. The main aim of this literature survey is to study the existing AI-based approaches like the convolutional neural network (CNN), generative adversarial network (GAN), AutoEncoders, etc for the enhancement of micro CT images and to compare the features of different models. This literature review shows all the potential methodologies for enhancing medical images using AI.

  volume={},

  pages={1911-1919},
  abstract={With increasing requirements for reliability, availability, efficiency, effectiveness, productivity, and security of the system, the importance of diagnostics and maintenance is also increasing. E-maintenance as a leading concept for maintenance management has so far primarily involved the use of domain-specific technical language processing (TLP) techniques on historical case data. Due to its popularity, generative AI (GAI) with large language models (LLMs) is starting to be used more and more in various technical areas, thus starting to take an increasingly important place in diagnostics and maintenance. Starting from the fact that the rapid development of information and communication technologies (ICT) was the main factor in the emergence and development of the concept of e-maintenance, the importance of the potential more serious application of all forms of generative AI in the context is clear. This is especially pronounced in cases of difficult or impossible access to the location of components or an uncertain situation related to the type of process (e.g., nuclear, aeronautical, space, offshore). Autonomous vehicles, vessels, and aircraft (as an indispensable part of today’s intelligent transport systems) are certainly a leading example of these cases. Regardless of the level of autonomy, these systems are extremely complex and difficult to maintain and represent a clear challenge for the application of new approaches. Therefore, the authors of the paper propose the use of middleware that would enable the integration of various GAI tools, algorithms, and models to increase the effectiveness of diagnostics and maintenance as close as possible to real-time. However, the exact extent of the possibilities and limitations of this approach has yet to be determined.},

  year={2023},
  volume={18},
  number={},
  pages={2751-2765},
  abstract={As a promising technique of resisting steganalysis detection, generative steganography usually generates a new image driven by secret information as the stego-image. However, it generally encodes secret information as entangled features in a non-distribution-preserving manner for the stego-image generation, which leads to two common issues: 1) limited accuracy of information extraction, and 2) low security in the feature-domain. To address the above limitations, we propose a generative steganographic framework via auto-generation of semantic object contours, in which a given secret message is encoded as the disentangled features, i.e., object-contours, in a distribution-preserving manner for the stego-image generation. In this framework, we propose a contour generative adversarial nets (CtrGAN) consisting of a contour-generator and a contour-discriminator, which are adversarially trained with reinforcement learning. To realize the generative steganography, by using the contour-generator of the trained CtrGAN, a contour point selection (CPS)-based encoding strategy is designed to encode the secret message as the contours. Then, the BicycleGAN is employed to transform the generated contours to the corresponding stego-image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed steganographic approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts in terms of information extraction accuracy, especially under common image attacks, and feature-domain security.},

  abstract={Due to the high acoustic variability, children speech recognition suffers significant performance reduction on most ASR systems which are optimized mainly using adults speech with limited or even none children speech. One of the most straight ideas to solve this problem is to increase the children's speech data during training, however, it is restricted by the more difficult process and higher cost when collecting children's speech compared to adults'. In this work, we develop a generative adversarial network (GANs) based data augmentation method to increase the size of children's training data to improve speech recognition performance for children's speech. Two different types of GANs are explored under WGAN-GP training framework, including the unconditional GANs with an unsupervised learning framework and the conditional GANs using acoustic states as conditions. The proposed data augmentation approaches are evaluated on a Mandarin speech recognition task, with only 40-hour children speech or further including 100-hour adult speech in the training. The results show that more than relative 20% WER reduction can be obtained on children speech testset with the proposed method, and the generated children speech with GAN even can improve the adults' speech within our experimental setups.},

  abstract={This research paper aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of AI bots in simulating human subjects for research purposes. In recent years, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in education has gained significant attention. While most approaches explore possibilities for teaching and learning, the possibilities for human subject research have been under-explored. By utilizing AI bots as a tool for data collection and analysis, researchers can potentially reduce costs, increase efficiency, and improve overall accuracy in their studies. This project focused on replicating a traditional qualitative research study on the topic of “humility in engineering“ with real human subjects in a simulated study using several publicly available generative AI tools - ChatGPT, Gemini, DebateAI, MasterDebater - to evaluate the effectiveness of AI bots as simulators of human subject research. The project assessed the “personalities“ and response patterns of AI tools leading to ethical implications of using AI bots as research simulators. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness and ethical implications of AI bots as simulators of human subject research, the project also explored the potential benefits and limitations of this approach. Overall, this project represents an important step towards understanding the role of AI bots in research and their potential impact on the engineering education research community. By evaluating the use of AI bots as simulators of human subject research, researchers can gain valuable insights into the benefits, limitations, and ethical considerations of this approach. Ultimately, this project seeks to advance the field of research methodology and contribute to the ongoing dialogue surrounding the use of AI in scientific studies.},

Early detection is crucial for preventing long-term damage and improving patient outcomes, yet existing diagnostic methods struggle to effectively capture the complexity of multimodal medical data and often lack interpretability. In this study, we propose an innovative approach that integrates multimodal deep learning with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance early cardiotoxicity detection. Our model combines clinical data (e.g., age and cardiovascular metrics) with Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI), a functional imaging technique that captures myocardial velocity during the cardiac cycle. To overcome data limitations, we employed Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) and Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGANs) to augment the dataset, improving its diversity and balance for better model training. We developed three architectures that integrate Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from TDI images with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Transformer models to capture temporal dependencies and enhance prediction accuracy. Additionally, we incorporated SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to interpret the contribution of input features, increasing model transparency and clinical applicability. Our Transformer-based model achieved the highest accuracy of 96%, outperforming the GRU (94%) and LSTM (89%) models, significantly surpassing traditional approaches. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based architectures in multimodal deep learning for precise cardiotoxicity prediction, supporting early intervention and personalized treatment strategies while improving interpretability through XAI techniques such as SHAP.},

  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have revolutionized image synthesis by using two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, to create realistic images from random noise. In this adversarial process, the generator attempts to fool the discriminator, which distinguishes between real and fake images. Advanced variants like conditional GANs and CycleGANs enable tasks like specified image generation and style transfer. Our paper presents improvements in image quality and training stability for GANs by introducing new training methods and loss function modifications to address issues like mode collapse. Evaluated on CelebA and CIFAR-10, our model outperforms previous GANs with Inception Scores of 9.69 and 10.79 and Frechet Inception Distances of 7.91 and -9.69, respectively. These results demonstrate better convergence, more stable training, and higher-quality image generation, establishing a new benchmark for GAN research and applications.},

It delineates meta-requirements and design principles that address both the transformative potential of GenAI, and the unique challenges faced by the fashion sector. To validate the practicality of the proposed design theory, a prototype system was developed and evaluated with feedback from 30 experienced fashion practitioners, confirming its feasibility and effectiveness.

  abstract={High voltage insulators are critical elements in power distribution and transmission systems, since their failure may represent losses in power quality and system reliability, leading to faults which bring problems to both consumer and electric utilities. Insulators in operation are subjected to all kinds of pollution which may cause the formation of dry bands when in presence of moisture, which leads to the formation of partial discharges which, in turn, causes degradation and aging of the surface material. Partial discharges origin can be identified by the pattern of their pulses. Machine learning algorithms are one of the most useful and efficient solutions for pattern recognition and classification tasks. In this paper, a methodology is proposed for data augmentation of the training set for an artificial neural network by means of generative adversarial networks.},

  pages={5255-5259},
  abstract={In recent years, offline reinforcement learning has attracted considerable attention in artificial intelligence. By generating a static dataset through a behavior policy, it is unable to engage in online interactions with the environment. However, this inevitably leads to states or actions undergoing inherent distribution shifts. To address the above concerns, offline reinforcement learning with generative adversarial networks and uncertainty estimation (GANUE) is proposed. This approach parameterizes the conditional generative adversarial networks and avoids the over-constraint problem that would be introduced when using a distance metric. Estimating the Q-value through ensemble uncertainty not only relaxes the policy constraint strength but also enhances the out-of-distribution generalization ability. The experimental results show that GANUE significantly performs better on the Maze2D and Adroit tasks than multiple baselines. In addition, we perform sensitivity analysis experiments for the parameters of the perturbation model.},

One of the key reason is the COVID-19 pandemic has demanded faster real-time development of AI-driven clinical and health support tools, including rapid data collection, algorithm development, validation, and deployment. However, there was not enough time for proper data quality control. Learning from the hard lessons in COVID-19, we summarize the important health data quality challenges during COVID-19 pandemic such as lack of data standardization, missing data, tabulation errors, and noise and artifact. Then we conduct a systematic investigation of computational methods that address these issues, including emerging novel advanced AI data quality control methods that achieve better data quality outcomes and, in some cases, simplify or automate the data cleaning process.

  abstract={Automatic strip steel surface defect detection is a difficult mission, as a result of the imbalanced class distributions caused by the sparse distribution of abnormal samples. The one-class classification (OCC) method can detect abnormal samples by only training the normal samples. The Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) can automatically learn the features of samples in unsupervised situations, and only one sample is used to train the model. The GAN-based one-class classification method for strip steel surface defects detection is proposed in the paper. The second to last output layer of GAN generator is chosen as the feature, which contains some basic and important information about the sample. In addition, an improved loss function is proposed to raise the stability of the model and the convergence speed. Then the one-class classifier can easily detect abnormal samples by comparing the feature of normal samples and abnormal samples. The proposed approach is validated in the strip steel data sets containing surface defect of different size, shape and type. The experiments have shown that the method can reach an average accuracy of 94% in the data sets.},

  abstract={Voice conversion (VC) refers to transforming the speaker characteristics of an utterance without altering its linguistic contents. Many works on voice conversion require to have parallel training data that is highly expensive to acquire. Recently, the cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN), which does not require parallel training data, has been applied to voice conversion, showing the state-of-the-art performance. The CycleGAN based voice conversion, however, can be used only for a pair of speakers, i.e., one-to-one voice conversion between two speakers. In this paper, we extend the CycleGAN by conditioning the network on speakers. As a result, the proposed method can perform many-to-many voice conversion among multiple speakers using a single generative adversarial network (GAN). Compared to building multiple CycleGANs for each pair of speakers, the proposed method reduces the computational and spatial cost significantly without compromising the sound quality of the converted voice. Experimental results using the VCC2018 corpus confirm the efficiency of the proposed method.},

Misclassifications can destabilize grid stability, underlining the importance of precise classification in decision-making processes. To combat this, this research proposes a DNN model that uses specific parameters that were fine-tuned for greater accuracy in classification tasks. Model correctness is an important performance metric that can be improved by architecture design and fine-tuning. For successful optimization, three essential loss functions (binary cross-entropy, categorical cross-entropy, and sparse categorical cross-entropy) are investigated.

  abstract={Missing values are very prevalent in real world; they are caused by various reasons such as user mistakes or device failures. They often cause critical problems especially in medical and healthcare application since they can lead to incorrect diagnosis or even cause system failure. Many of recent imputation techniques have adopted machine learning-based generative methods such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) to deal with missing values in medical data. They are, however, incapable of reproducing realistic time-series signals preserving important latent features such as sleep stages that are important context in many medical applications using electroencephalogram (EEG). In this study, we propose a novel GAN-based technique generating realistic EEG signal sequences which are not only shown natural but also correctly classified with sleep stages by implanting the latent features in the synthetic sequence. By experiments, we confirm that our model generates not only more realistic EEG signals than a recent GAN-based model but also preserve auxiliary information such as sleep stages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that existing machine learning methods based on EEG data still work well without sacrificing performance using the imputed data by using our method.},

This study examines the adoption of ChatGPT by assessing its alignment with four key supply chain tasks: optimization, adaptability, sustainability, and coordination. To explain the mechanisms driving adoption, we integrate the Task-Technology Fit (TTF) theory with the Stimulus-Organism-Response framework, modeling ChatGPT as a stimulus that influences user trust, satisfaction, and technology anxiety—cognitive and emotional responses that shape behavioral intention. Empirical data were collected from 382 SCM professionals across diverse industries and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling. The results demonstrate that perceived TTF significantly enhances trust and satisfaction, both of which have a positive influence on the intention to adopt ChatGPT. Importantly, the study reveals that technology anxiety moderates these relationships, diminishing the strength of trust and satisfaction in driving adoption. This finding highlights the importance of addressing psychological resistance in conjunction with the deployment of technology. By offering a dual-theoretical lens and empirical validation, this research contributes to the emerging literature on Gen-AI adoption, providing actionable insights for practitioners seeking to integrate ChatGPT into their supply chain operations.},

  abstract={Generative AI is rapidly reshaping educational environments, offering transformative possibilities for teaching, learning, and student engagement. As UNESCO DirectorGeneral Audrey Azoulay aptly remarked, “Education will be profoundly transformed by AI.” This transformation impacts not only how knowledge is accessed but also how learning experiences are personalized, how curricula are developed, and how educators are trained. Despite the growing integration of AI tools into education, particularly generative AI, several critical questions remain: How effectively is generative AI being used to support and enhance learning? Are students merely passive recipients of AI-generated content, or are they active participants in more meaningful, personalized learning experiences? What specific generative AI tools are currently being implemented in classrooms, and how do both educators and students perceive their impact and integration? This paper presents the findings of a comprehensive survey conducted at Esprit School of Engineering (ESE) and Esprit School of Business (ESB). The goal is to capture the perspectives of students and teachers on the application and perceived impact of generative AI tools in educational settings. Using a Likert scale, the survey evaluates attitudes toward usability, effectiveness, and the potential of these tools to enhance both teaching and learning outcomes. Additionally, the study explores whether generative AI helps create a more engaging and interactive learning environment. The primary objective of this research is to explore how generative AI is perceived and utilized in classrooms, as well as the barriers and facilitators that affect its adoption. We begin by reviewing the current landscape of generative AI in education, focusing on its most prevalent applications. We then detail the survey methodology and analyze the results, offering insights into both opportunities and challenges posed by these AI tools. Finally, we conclude by discussing the broader implications of our findings and providing recommendations for future AI integration in education.},

  abstract={This innovative practice WIP paper describes a pedagogical approach to use generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to promote critical thinking among students in the fields of architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC). Technology is advancing at an unprecedented rate, impacting many aspects of human interaction. AEC are among the fields experiencing this rapid technological evolution. Since education in these areas is continuously improving and adapting to new technologies, the motivation behind this study is to explore how GenAI can support the development of critical thinking in AEC. The correct use of GenAI as a tool in education is crucial for ensuring that students benefit from its capabilities while retaining their own analytical skills. Recognizing the potential of this technology in the professional world, this study focuses on college-level students in architecture and civil engineering courses to promote critical thinking skills by using GenAI as a complementary tool to enhance learning experience. Harnessing GenAI to cultivate critical thinking skills among students can enhance their ability to tackle complex problems and adapt to technological advancements. The main objective of this ongoing study is to explore the integration og GenAI into the learning process to foster critical thinking skills. To achieve this, students in AEC courses at the Universidad San Francisco de Quito (USFQ) were introduced to a GenAI application to generate summaries points of specific themes. Then, students were instructed to engage in three rounds of answers-based questioning to further explore the topic from a critical thinking lens. The instructor provided guidance on formulating questions to encourage reflective and critical thinking. Students reported on their interactions, detailing the path of questions and answers and their viewpoints on the assigned topic at the end of the experiment. After the exercise, researchers administered an open-ended survey to gather qualitative information on student's perspective regarding the impact of the GenAI on their learning process and critical thinking development. Data were collected from students of various academic years and AEC specialties, providing insights into their critical thinking development in different contexts. The study also analyzes potential factors influencing the relationship between GenAI use, academic performance and critical thinking in AEC education.},

The results from network flow analyses under image quality constraints show that the generative network layer can achieve an improvement of more than 100% in terms of the required data rate.},

  title={Integrating Two-Tier Optimization Algorithm With Convolutional Bi-LSTM Model for Robust Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Vehicles}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={13},
  number={},
  pages={6820-6833},
  abstract={Industrial development has changed vehicles of traditional into autonomous vehicles (AVs). AVs play a significant role since they are measured as a vital module of smart cities. The AV is an advanced automobile efficient in preserving secure driving by evading collisions formed by drivers. In contrast with traditional vehicles, which are fully coordinated and functioned by humans, AVs gather information regarding the exterior environment utilizing sensors to guarantee secure navigation. AVs decrease environmental effects since they regularly employ electricity to function rather than fossil fuel, thus diminishing greenhouse gasses. However, AVs might be exposed to cyber-attacks, causing dangers to human life. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based anomaly recognition has progressed as a new study track in autonomous driving. ML and DL-based anomaly detection scholars have focused on improving accuracy as a typical classification task without aiming at mischievous information. This article develops an improved whale optimization algorithm-based feature selection using explainable artificial intelligence for robust anomaly detection (IWOAFS-XAIAD) technique in autonomous driving. The major aim of the IWOAFS-XAIAD technique is an endwise XAI structure to construe and imagine the anomaly recognition classifications prepared by AI models securing autonomous driving systems. Initially, the IWOAFS-XAIAD technique utilizes the Z-score data normalization method to convert input data into a compatible layout. Besides, the IWOAFS-XAIAD technique employs an improved whale optimization algorithm (IWOA)-based feature subset selection to pick an optimum set of features. An attention mechanism with the CNN-BiLSTM (CNN-BiLSTM-A) model is employed for anomaly detection and classification. Moreover, the catch-fish optimization algorithm (CFOA) selects the hyperparameters connected to the CNN-BiLSTM-A model. Finally, utilizing the SHAP XAI method, the IWOAFS-XAIAD technique performs local and global descriptions for the black-box AI model. To demonstrate the optimum classification outcome of the IWOAFS-XAIAD technique, a wide range of experiments is performed on a VeReMi dataset. The experimental validation of the IWOAFS-XAIAD technique portrayed a superior accuracy value of 98.52% over the existing methods.},

  title={Learning Deep Generative Clustering via Mutual Information Maximization}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={34},
  number={9},
  pages={6263-6275},
  abstract={Deep clustering refers to joint representation learning and clustering using deep neural networks. Existing methods can be mainly categorized into two types: discriminative and generative methods. The former learns representations for clustering with discriminative mechanisms directly, and the latter estimate the latent distribution of each cluster for generating data points and then infers cluster assignments. Although generative methods have the advantage of estimating the latent distributions of clusters, their performances still significantly fall behind discriminative methods. In this work, we argue that this performance gap might be partly due to the overlap of data distribution of different clusters. In fact, there is little guarantee of generative methods to separate the distributions of different clusters in the data space. To tackle these problems, we theoretically prove that mutual information maximization promotes the separation of different clusters in the data space, which provides a theoretical justification for deep generative clustering with mutual information maximization. Our theoretical analysis directly leads to a model which integrates a hierarchical generative adversarial network and mutual information maximization. Moreover, we further propose three techniques and empirically show their effects to stabilize and enhance the model. The proposed approach notably outperforms other generative models for deep clustering on public benchmarks.},

  abstract={In recent past Communication has played a key role in the job market and societal norms. Students with better communication skills are academically and technically smart, they communicate and understand their colleagues which creates a holistic work/study environment. The four main divisions of communication skills are LSRW (Listening, speaking, reading and writing). Each and every division is directly or indirectly dependent on each other. Improving these four skills are essential in today’s world. To foster these skills a new model has been proposed which is backed by AI (Artificial Intelligence). After each skill module this model tests a student’s communication skills and generates feedback which shows the interpretation level of the student. This data is given to an AI model which generates questions according to the understanding of each student. Each student gets a unique set of questions according to his/her understanding and interpretation skills. This model coerces a student to engage in advancing their communication skills. It strengthens one’s knowledge in each and every aspect of the communication skill as it has speaking and listening exercises incorporated in it. Hence, we can say that the proposed AI model has a $\mathbf{95\%}$ success rate as it has an optimistic effect in a student’s study and work-related aspects. Since it is easy and effective it can be incorporated in schools, colleges, universities, companies and various other institutions. The implementation of these AI tools shows a generative impact in the above-mentioned institutions.},

  abstract={Seismic data interpolation is an effective way to reconstruct missing seismic traces and to improve the quality of the seismic data set. In the field of deep learning, generative adversarial networks are capable of data generation and interpolation and have been widely used for high-quality image generations and image interpolations. In this letter, we propose a dual-domain conditional generative adversarial network (DD-CGAN) for seismic data interpolation. The DD-CGAN consists of a generator network and a discriminator network and uses the seismic data set and discrete Fourier transformed data set in the frequency domain as input vectors. The loss function of the DD-CGAN is defined by the generative-adversarial loss, the data loss function, and the total variation loss. Thus, the DD-CGAN can be trained more accurately. The discriminator is used to calculate the feature differences between the interpolated seismic data set and the complete seismic data set to drive the generator network for learning optimal parameters. The numerical results on the test data set and field seismic data set demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DD-CGAN.},

However, it is important to understand that the challenges must be addressed. It may act as a good source for collating the information, but it is always advised by the researchers that one’s own perspective must be added to draw inferences from the output generated by ChatGPT. Our study supports the finding that ChatGPT can be used for the generation of ideas or to learn a new language. It also becomes imperative for the faculties to motivate students to use ChatGPT and add their inferences as well.

Expanding the degrees of freedom (DoF) of design of metamaterials and metasurfaces creates new opportunities for innovative metantenna designs by the introduction of novel physical properties. However, the increased DoF also increases significant complexity of the design process. To tackle this challenge, prior-knowledge-guided deep learning-enabled (PK-DL) optimization and synthesis methods have been proposed and developed. These methods integrate prior knowledge into deep learning algorithms, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (cDCGANs), to guide and accelerate metantenna design processes. Recent progress demonstrates that AI algorithms applied to antenna design open new opportunities for optimizing and synthesizing metantennas with enhanced performance and multifunctional capabilities.},

  abstract={The trend of using larger scale antenna arrays will continue toward 6G systems, where the number of antennas will be further scaled up to improve spectral efficiency. However, the increase in the number of antennas will bring new challenges to the physical layer, such as frequent feedback in high-speed mobile communications, multiband coexistence overhead from sub-6 (gigahertz) GHz to terahertz (THz), and energy consumption due to increased antenna components and circuits. In this article, we introduce artificial intelligence (AI)-based channel extrapolation to address these problems. Specifically, we divide the channel extrapolation into time, frequency, and space domains according to different application scenarios. The channel propagation characteristics that affect the extrapolation of each domain, such as the spatial consistency property (SCP), partial reciprocity, and spatial nonstationarity, are analyzed. The motivations for selecting various AI models in each domain are explained, and the performance of AI models is compared. Furthermore, we find the gain of cross-domain channel extrapolation based on transfer learning (TL). The simulation results show that the experience of the AI model cross different domains can be mutually reinforcing. Finally, we introduce several challenges for AI-based channel extrapolation, which can be regarded as potential research directions for realizing future AI-powered 6G systems.},

  abstract={The diagnosis of brain related disorders requires a detailed analysis of various scan images some of them are Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT), Electro Encephalogram (EEG), functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) etc. Both functional and metabolic activities are available in SPECT and PET data while anatomical features are available in MRI and CT. The amount of medical imaging data to be analysed on daily basis is large and the analysis of such medical image data need expertise in those area. The huge amount of data available can be analysed by using Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is a promising technique that have shown great potential in various aspects of brain image processing, including image segmentation, classification, registration and disease diagnosis. The integration of various AI techniques in brain image processing has the potential to enrich the understanding of brain structure, function and pathology. AI models an assist in automated diagnosis of brain disorders by analysing medical imaging data and can learn the patterns and features indicative of specific brain disorder and classify them accurately. For example AI algorithm has been developed to diagnose disorders like Alzheimer’s disease, Stroke, Epileptic seizures, Parkinson’s disease and Brain tumour. AI algorithm can automatically segment brain images and identify specific biomarkers associated with different brain disorders. This helps in quantifying disease related changes in the brain and tracking disease progression. For instance in Alzheimer’s disease research AI can be used to segment brain structures to identify early signs of the disease. AI algorithm can provide personalized risk assessments and prognostic predictions.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-18},
  abstract={Hypersonic morphing vehicles (HMVs) require multiple landing footprint predictions on decision-making and target allocation. Unlike the traditional hypersonic vehicle, the varying aerodynamic characteristics corresponding to different shapes pose challenges to the landing footprint prediction. This study proposes a rapid landing footprint prediction method for HMV based on the Dual-Generator Wasserstein Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (DG-WCGAN). By leveraging the learning capabilities and computational efficiency of generative artificial intelligence, this method eliminates integral calculations and accurately predicts the landing footprint for the current shape or morphing-enabled situation. First, an aerodynamic parameters and landing footprint database is constructed using aerodynamic simulation software and numerical optimization. Further, the structure of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is tailored by incorporating a dual generator. This enables the one-step computation of aerodynamic parameters and landing footprint and offers the flexibility to adjust the number of generated landing points according to the requirements. Moreover, the extra network can be independently utilized for aerodynamic parameter calculations in HMV control. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed DG-WCGAN method improves computational speed by 21.7% while reducing prediction error by 68.6% compared to the DNN approaches and exhibits better generalization capability.},

  abstract={Educators believe that using technology in education will be more effective for the new generation of learners. Therefore, we propose an educational technology platform called Hakawati that supports educators’ teaching methods and students’ learning skills by utilizing artificial intelligence capabilities based on text-to-speech (TTS) and text generation technologies. For the story-generation component of Hakawati, we employed a pretrained transformer model called Turbo 3.5. This model creates coherent narratives from various prompts, perfectly satisfying the goal of transforming lessons into stories. To ensure the effectiveness of the models, subjective evaluations were conducted using measures, such as relevance, coherence, story completeness, language, and grammar. To convert the generated stories into speech, Coqui_XTTS version 2 and StyleTTS were evaluated using a subjective mean opinion score for naturalness and understandability. Coqui_XTTS outperformed its counterpart, with the language model scoring 4.44 out of 5, whereas StyleTTS scored 1.7 out of 5. This demonstrates the ability of Coqui_XTTS to generate high-quality natural speech, add an immersive auditory element to the story, and enhance the user experience.},

  number={4},
  pages={885-895},
  abstract={The heightened emphasis on the regulation of deep generative models, propelled by escalating concerns pertaining to privacy and compliance with regulatory frameworks, underscores the imperative need for precise control mechanisms over these models. This urgency is particularly underscored by instances in which generative models generate outputs that encompass objectionable, offensive, or potentially injurious content. In response, machine unlearning has emerged to selectively forget specific knowledge or remove the influence of undesirable data subsets from pretrained models. However, modern machine unlearning approaches typically assume access to model parameters and architectural details during unlearning, which is not always feasible. In multitude of downstream tasks, these models function as black-box systems, with inaccessible pretrained parameters, architectures, and training data. In such scenarios, the possibility of filtering undesired outputs becomes a practical alternative. Our proposed method feature aware similarity thresholding (FAST) effectively suppresses undesired outputs by systematically encoding the representation of unwanted features in the latent space. We employ user-marked positive and negative samples to guide this process, leveraging the latent space's inherent capacity to capture these undesired representations. During inference, we use this identified representation in the latent space to compute projection similarity metrics with newly sampled latent vectors. Subsequently, we meticulously apply a threshold to exclude undesirable samples from the output.},

  abstract={The automation of railway operations is an activity in constant growth. Different railway stakeholders are already developing their research activities for the future driverless autonomous driving based on computer vision (CV) and artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced perception technologies (e.g., obstacle detection). Unfortunately, the AI models are opaque in nature, and there are no certification accepted rules for CV&AI-enhanced functionality certification. Capturing and labeling camera image in real environment is expensive in terms of time and resources and it does not guarantee enough variation in edge visibility conditions, which makes the resulting database less valuable for the validation and verification (V&V) processes. To meet the increasing needs of trusted CV&AI-based solutions, numerous V&V approaches have been proposed in other sectors such as automotive, most of them based on virtual simulators. Unfortunately, there is currently no virtual perception simulator for railway scenario. This work aims to create a semi-automatic system based on virtual scenarios measuring the CV&AI-enhanced system performance facing different visibility conditions. It will be based on the global accuracy metrics and detected potential safety and operation rules’ violations. This work also demonstrates the quantitative and qualitative improvements while reducing current V&V cost.},

  abstract={Accurate prediction of crash frequency is important in highway safety research. One obstacle for developing crash frequency models is the lack of real crash data. One way to address this obstacle is to generate realistic artificial data (RAD) that mimics the known causal relationships between contributing factors and crashes. There is no existing research demonstrating use of RAD in predicting crashes. This study first generates a RAD dataset using a transformer-based tabular generative adversarial network (TTGAN) and then uses it to predict crash frequency. Five traditional machine learning models and one deep learning model were tested. Results showed that the deep learning model, TabNet, outperformed the traditional machine learning models. The model performance was also tested using observed (real) crash data. The performance ranking of the six models on real data and RAD was the same, thus demonstrating that synthetic data can be used to test promising machine learning models.},

  abstract={GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) are a type of deep learning generative model that has lately gained popularity in recent years. GANs can learn patterns from high-dimensional complex data, making them useful for image, audio and video processing. Nonetheless, there are several significant obstacles in the training of GANs, such as instability, mode collapse and non-convergence. To address these issues, researchers have developed a variety of GAN variations by rethinking network topology, modifying the form of goal functions, and changing optimization to precise methods in recent years. This paper describes a thorough analysis of the progress of GAN architecture and optimization solutions to improve its efficiency in various computer vision applications and challenges that are to be faced while implementing the model towards CV (computer vision) is described. It is believed that GAN is strong model and further researches are needed to work in this area to solve a variety of computer vision real time applications.},

  year={2022},
  volume={60},
  number={},
  pages={1-14},
  abstract={In recent years, hyperspectral image classification (HIC) algorithm based on deep learning has been widely studied, and has achieved much better results than traditional algorithms. HIC using small samples has gradually become a research hotspot, and the generative adversarial networks (GANs) have become a brilliant application in this field. However, the HIC results based on GAN methods are poor and volatile, since a single loss function cannot accurately measure the distance between the generated samples and the real samples in different hyperspectral images. To resolve this problem, we propose a novel immune evolutionary generative adversarial network (HIEGAN) via leveraging the evolutionary strategy and immune strategy. Specifically, we enhance the performance of the generator in two ways: 1) HIEGAN uses multiple loss functions for calculation and backpropagation, so as to endow the generator with different parameter values and select the best one as the evolution result each time to enter the next iteration and 2) in the training process, we preserve the optimal generator as memory cells to avoid the performance degradation of the generator. Through these changes, HIEGAN overcame the defects of GAN, improved the stability of GAN, and finally improved classification efficiency. At the same time, in order to alleviate the overfitting problem of depth network under small samples, we change convolution and deconvolution into ghost module to reduce the network parameters. Experiments on three classical datasets validate that HIEGAN has encouraging performance in HIC under small samples.},

Examining the model’s robustness to data that is not in the training set and its capacity for sophisticated problem solving are also included in the evaluation process. Because it identifies opportunities for improvement and facilitates better decision-making, interpretability is a crucial component of evaluating an AI model’s performance.

  abstract={In this paper, we introduce OpenCIR, a fullyfunctional Conditional Image Repainting (CIR) model designed for local image editing. Given an image and a combination of conditions related to geometry, texture, and color, CIR models are required to repaint instances and seamlessly composite them with the original images. Previous CIR models suffer from limited object categories, restricted condition modalities, and demanded geometry precision. In contrast, leveraging the generative priors from pre-trained models, OpenCIR could repaint open object categories. Equipped with redesigned condition injection modules and the condition extension strategy, OpenCIR is able to understand open condition modalities. Adopting the contour refinement strategy, OpenCIR allows users to specify instances with open geometry precision. In addition, we contribute the OPEN-CIR dataset, which includes detailed annotations, tailored for the comprehensive training and evaluation of the OpenCIR model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenCIR outperforms relevant state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior visual quality, and more favorable results by human evaluators.},

  volume={44},

  abstract={We propose a unified game-theoretical framework to perform classification and conditional image generation given limited supervision. It is formulated as a three-player minimax game consisting of a generator, a classifier and a discriminator, and therefore is referred to as Triple Generative Adversarial Network (Triple-GAN). The generator and the classifier characterize the conditional distributions between images and labels to perform conditional generation and classification, respectively. The discriminator solely focuses on identifying fake image-label pairs. Theoretically, the three-player formulation guarantees consistency. Namely, under a nonparametric assumption, the unique equilibrium of the game is that the distributions characterized by the generator and the classifier converge to the data distribution. As a byproduct of the three-player formulation, Triple-GAN is flexible to incorporate different semi-supervised classifiers and GAN architectures. We evaluate Triple-GAN in two challenging settings, namely, semi-supervised learning and the extremely low data regime. In both settings, Triple-GAN can achieve excellent classification results and generate meaningful samples in a specific class simultaneously. In particular, using a commonly adopted 13-layer CNN classifier, Triple-GAN outperforms extensive semi-supervised learning methods substantially on several benchmarks no matter data augmentation is applied or not.},

Voice interface, developed with AI technology, is an innovative method to actively control devices. However, the system's vulnerabilities are exploited by malicious attempts on the system, such as dolphin and adversarial attacks on speech recognition devices, and frequent unintended errors occur, such as malfunctioning in response to unauthorized voice signals. In this study, we attempt to effectively find vulnerabilities in these AI speech recognition devices using fuzzing techniques that are generally used to find vulnerabilities in software. In addition, for effective testing, an optimization method for voice fuzzing is proposed to reduce testing time from test coverage perspective. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimization scheme can improve the testing time by approximately 29% by adopting a two-stage fuzzing method.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a fog weather data augmentation method for the unmanned surface vessels (USVs) via improved Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) model. First, a generator scheme for GAN is proposed with the guided generation of the atmospheric scattering model in this paper. A Laplacian Pyramid Based Depth Residuals model is added to the generator which reduces the difficulty of generating fog images caused by the degradation of water surface image and improves the quality of generated images. Finally, fog images are generated from sunny weather images collected with HUST-12C by LPBDR-GAN model and experiments show that generated images are very close to real fog images.},

  abstract={The increasing use of social platforms has led to the rampant spread of disinformation in a number of domains and hampered the credibility of these sources. Disinformation is a type of information disorder wherein fake information is generated with the intent to harm. Machine learning and deep learning can be used to detect such auto-generated information. The conventional method includes gathering vast volumes of text data in terms of both true and fake news stories, headlines, or any other sources and then labeling the data. This leaves us with the issues of human bias within these existing systems, the quality of the aggregated data from different sources and their accurate labeling. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a textual deep fake detection and generation framework based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The methods are demonstrated on three separate domains namely, political data, sports-related data, and medical data pertaining to COVID 19. Cosine similarity-based evaluation metric is employed for analyzing the classification accuracy of the discriminator and the performance of the Generator in generating near-true fake articles which are very similar in the style and context to the real datasets. The contribution of this work is threefold; firstly, we have demonstrated the generator network which generates the synthetic textual deep-fakes which are extremely similar to the actual instances of disinformation. Secondly, the development of a discriminator network that detects the system-generated data with the real data and lastly, the composite GAN model which can be used in various applications such as automated labeling and annotation is shown. Additionally, this approach can help in generating balanced datasets required for machine learning tasks and alleviate the problem of bias in AI systems, especially for disinformation detection tasks where the disinformation class instances are typically lesser as compared to the true information instances.},

  abstract={Since years, the interior space planning stage typically involves a labor intensive, iterative process that required manually balancing multiple factors, including meeting specific design and aesthetic goals by incorporating professional input, and optimizing design performance for efficiency and user experience. Traditional approaches for interior space layout optimization had face several challenges which include noise in labels, doesn't captured complex relationships. Therefore, this research proposes Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)-GraphSAGE for interior space layout optimization. Initially, the data is taken from Regional Planning and Land Use Analysis Network (RPLAN) dataset. Then, data is preprocessed by using Soft label encoder which effectively captured uncertainty in labels. The preprocessed data is used for room graph generation by using Wasserstein GAN which effectively, generated more realistic room layouts by capturing complex relationships between objects. After that, layout generation is done by using GraphSAGE for capturing complex relationships between objects by enabling contextual layout generation. Finally, design and quality evaluation is done by using space syntax analysis which effectively, analyzed spatial relationships by revealing hidden patterns. The proposed Wasserstein GAN- GraphSAGE established better results, IOU of 0.19, precision 0.48, recall 0.50 when compared with existing Bicycle GAN.},

  abstract={Acquiring high-quality medical images such as MRI scans is essential for diagnostics and treatment planning but remains challenging due to high costs, health risks, and data scarcity. To address this, we propose the use of Generative Ad-versarial Networks (GANs) to synthesize MRI images, alleviating the limitations of medical data availability. This paper presents a fine-tuned BigGAN model, optimized to generate MRI scans representing different stages of Alzheimer's disease. We explore the impact of various loss functions, including Adversarial, Hinge, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss, on model performance. While the outputs showcase the potential of GAN s to generate high-quality medical images, challenges such as mode collapse and overfitting remain. The synthesized images offer significant promise for enhancing AI model training and medical research, particularly in scenarios where acquiring real medical images is difficult.},

  abstract={Blockchains have enabled a slew of new opportunities, to create decentralized software and organizations. Riding on its tailcoats, we want to create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) headed by Artificial Intelligence (AI). In a world where human error is majorly becoming the sole reason for mistakes, as small as a missed medication to huge ones like Chernobyl, it is becoming increasingly important to automate as many actions as possible. Creating automated organizations is only but a first step towards the goal. We decided to make an art organization which sells art to make money. The standard way of doing that would be to create a web platform like Amazon (controlled by humans) that sells art and let human artists upload their artwork. But in the interest of keeping this as automated as possible; we have decided to make a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which generates art. Our organization will sell this art created by the GAN and use the revenues to pay for its resources. An AI will be heading it. Hence the DAO will be an entirely human less organization capable of sustaining itself.},

  abstract={This study assesses an innovative AI literacy intervention program for teachers that incorporates social-emotional learning (SEL) into its teaching approach. Executed through three distinct strands—ABOUT, WITH, and FOR—the program aims to enhance foundational knowledge of AI, practical applications in the classroom, and ethical considerations in education. Longitudinal data collected from 54 Slovenian future K-12 teachers indicate marked improvements in both AI and SEL competencies. A hierarchical cluster analysis revealed distinct teacher profiles, illustrating a notable shift from skepticism to advocacy in the application of AI and SEL throughout the duration of the program. Notably, findings demonstrate that the program’s impact doubles the effect size benchmark established by Hattie’s hinge point, underscoring the significant and transformative influence of the program. Further research is needed to assess the long-term impact of such programs aiming at genAI in broader educational contexts.},
