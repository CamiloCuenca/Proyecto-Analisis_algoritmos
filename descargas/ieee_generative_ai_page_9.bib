  abstract={Natural disasters, including earthquakes, wildfires and cyclones, bear a huge risk on human lives as well as infrastructure assets. An effective response to disaster depends on the ability to rapidly and efficiently assess the intensity of damage. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) presents a breakthrough solution, capable of combining knowledge from multiple types and sources of data, simulating realistic scenarios of disaster, and identifying emerging trends at a speed previously unimaginable. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review on the prospects of AI and GenAI in damage assessment for various natural disasters, highlighting both its strengths and limitations. We talk about its application to multimodal data such as text, image, video, and audio, and also cover major issues of data privacy, security, and ethical use of the technology during crises. The paper also recognizes the threat of Generative AI misuse, in the form of dissemination of misinformation and for adversarial attacks. Finally, we outline avenues of future research, emphasizing the need for secure, reliable, and ethical Generative AI systems for disaster management in general. We believe that this work represents the first comprehensive survey of Gen-AI techniques being used in the field of Disaster Assessment and Response.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence systems are increasingly used in critical areas like finance, healthcare, and autonomous systems, ensuring their security becomes crucial. Artificial Intelligence models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small changes to input data can cause major errors, as well as steganographic methods that hide harmful information within digital content. Recent techniques, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for steganography and adversarial training for model hardening, have shown promise but face challenges like computational inefficiency, limited generalizability, and susceptibility to evolving threats. The methodology includes five key steps: synthetic data generation, data preprocessing, multi-layered security assessments, dynamic countermeasures, and cross-domain validation. By using adversarial and steganographic data augmentation, the framework strengthens the Artificial Intelligence's ability to handle real-world threats. The approach also integrates advanced feature extraction and classification methods to improve detection accuracy. The model is tested across various domains, demonstrating its ability to secure AI systems against evolving digital threats while maintaining efficiency and adaptability.},

  abstract={This conceptualisation involves developing an online application software that incorporates generative AI in providing counselling information on career based on the users' interests, skills and expectations. Face to face counselling on the other hand has its constraints in terms of scale and accessibility but this form of career counseling by use of the present artificial intelligence also aspires to break barriers and provide a leveling ground for all students. This information includes the grade level, expected career, academic interests, skills, and hobbies users offer. The AI provides and explains several occupations, good as well as specific ones, which enables students to consider more jobs. It also provides the best colleges available, required degrees, expected income and future scope. When career awareness has been limited to competitive fields, the application enables students to think pragmatically about the options available to them. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based user interface enables the input of several attributes by students and reception of associated AI career suggestions. The inputs are then passed through a generative AI API running on a Node server to improve the usability of the response. This innovative method teaches students using artificial intelligence and using behavioral counseling principles and provides students with clear, evidence-based information regarding their future occupations.},

  abstract={Summary <p>AI has been making inroads into education for the last few years, and as with many sectors, GenAI will massively accelerate this trend. In any education setting, from schools and colleges to self&#x2010;directed lifelong learning, GenAI has the capacity to provide super&#x2010;personalized learning, make teachers' jobs easier, and help students understand topics more easily. GenAI can also be used to generate personalized follow&#x2010;up questions to help cement understanding. Kortext is an interesting example. The education platform is designed to help universities and colleges provide AI&#x2010;enhanced teaching and personalized learning experiences. The use of GenAI in college applications is another hot topic.

  abstract={The quest of imparting intelligence into human creations have led to the inception and progress of Artificial Intelligence (AI). One application of AI is the generation of things like text or images, using a class of neural networks known as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Nowadays, AI can generate different sorts of artwork and arts using GANs. However, many traditional art design patterns that are tied historically to a particular segment of the demographics and geographic are left unexplored so far. Henna artwork is one of them. In this regard, this paper aims at the generation of Henna design patterns, which is a widely popular artwork involving of complex creative designs applied mostly on the hands as a type of temporary tattoo in the Indian sub-continent and parts of Asia. The HennaGan introduced in this paper shows that Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCGANs) can be used to generate henna design images with variations effectively. It also creates the base for research into creative Henna art generation using DCGANs and provides insights into how the network parameters can be tuned to obtain a good result.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) harbors the potential to tackle intricate challenges and enhance human capabilities across various domains. Through its significant capabilities, AI plays a crucial role in data analysis, natural language processing (NLP), healthcare, and other decision-based fields. The primary objective of AI in these domains is to render precise decisions promptly. The attainment of higher decisionmaking accuracy and system performance enhancement necessitates the utilization of optimization algorithms to aid in the decision-making process efficiently. Swarm optimization draws inspiration from the collective behavior of animals or insects that cooperate in hunting, thereby facilitating rapid decision-making. This chapter delves into diverse swarm optimization algorithms that support decision-making processes in AI applications and introduces a novel algorithm called African wild dog optimization (AWDO). The proposed AWDO algorithm is an energy-efficient swarm optimization technique that minimizes energy consumption by AI nodes or neurons, resulting in expedited search outcomes. The efficacy of the AWDO algorithm is evaluated against established optimization algorithms like particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimization (ACO), artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization algorithm, firefly algorithm, and bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) algorithms in the realm of healthcare diagnosis applications.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence is becoming more mainstream. Artificial intelligence has been used in medical diagnostics, detecting financial fraud, managing smart grids, and many other beneficial applications. Large language models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence designed to understand and generate human language. Tools such as ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Meta's Llama, and xAI's Grok have been widely used in a variety of contexts. However, there are malicious applications of artificial intelligence that are already being used. Artificial intelligence has been used to generate child sexual exploitation material (CSAM). Artificial intelligence being used to facilitate cyber-attacks is a growing concern. Deep fakes have been used to perpetrate elaborate financial frauds. There is also the concern of deep fakes being used to influence elections. Large language models have already been shown to create more believable phishing emails than human threat actors. Perhaps more disturbing, there have been studies showing LLMs providing guidance in planning and execution of a biological attack. AI can be used to identify and exploit vulnerable individuals online, such as for human trafficking, sexual exploitation, or labor exploitation by analyzing social media profiles and patterns of behavior. The current study analyzes the major malicious uses of artificial intelligence, including specific actual cases, and provides an overview of steps to mitigate these uses.},

  abstract={Emotional Intelligence is the technology where computers are trained to handle, use, understand and manage emotions. Emotional Intelligence (EI) is used in sentimental text generation where sentimental texts like positive, negative and neutral texts are generated. Sentimental text generation is used in many Artificial Intelligence application such as Google Assistant, Siri, Chatbots and so on. Many Deep learning algorithms such as LSTM, Bi-LSTM, RNN and CNN focus on generation of sentimental texts. The research work proposed herein uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for generating texts based on the training dataset. The GAN network has 2 models; generator model which generates the text and discriminator model which evaluates the text and both are trained using Bi-LSTM algorithm. The model is trained using Amazon customer review dataset and the system generates sentimental text such as positive, negative and neutral text for a given product. The existing system uses LSTM algorithm for prediction, but the performance and quality of generated text is low. The proposed system uses the Bi-LSTM algorithm which increases the accuracy of the generated sentimental text. The performance of the framework is evaluated in terms of fluency, sentimental accuracy and context relevance and is compared to the existing system of Automatic Generation of Sentimental Texts using Mixture Adversarial Networks.},

  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a major innovation in the field of deep learning. It has been widely used in image generation and text-to-image conversion tasks. However, it is challenging for GANs to find a balance for competition between generators and discriminators. In this paper, we investigate the optimization effect of combining the Adam optimization algorithm and genetic algorithm on the GANs training process. In the experiment, we first use the Adam algorithm to pre-train GANs and then apply the genetic algorithm (GA) to further optimize the pre-trained model. The experimental results show that this combination method not only reduces the number of iterations required by the genetic algorithm through pre-training, thus saving the training time but also improves the performance of the training model. This shows that the use of a hybrid optimization strategy in complex network training is very effective and improves training efficiency.},

  abstract={In this paper, we explore memory and Schema through the lens of mathematical representation. By defining themes related to cognitive processes, we propose a compression algorithm that measures and retains important information of previous (historic) user-Generative AI interaction. Time and memory are interconnected via a decay mechanism, where context gets more abstract as time passes. At the same time, memories with thematic resemblance can be structured into Schemas using set theory, based on rules influenced by a maturity threshold. This threshold is determined by factors such as criticality, emotional-user interaction, and mass, which is the measure of the summation of related memories. Our approach reconstructs memories into reusable parameters and formulates Schemas, offering a foundation for more personalized and cost-effective human-GAI interactions.},

  abstract={Mammography is the leading methodology used to diagnose breast cancer. Effective, cheap and reliable, the mammography can be used to screen large populations, if the imagery produced can be analysed efficiently. State-of-the-art generative artificial intelligence approaches can be used to create tools able to aid in this task. Here we present a study focused on the emerging research topic of the application of generative diffusion models to the task of anomaly detection and we apply if for detecting anomalies on mammograms. Diffusion models exhibit promising results in making pixel-level predictions with image level annotations, but no such application has been published so far regarding mammography. We have, therefore, developed a novel approach utilizing U-net backbone that is able to generate mammograms with Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) of 14.62. We showed its ability to perform anomaly detection with Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.195 which demonstrates the viability of our approach for early-stage research.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence models are increasingly used in industrial applications to assist with predictive tasks. However, the complexity of industrial environments poses challenges to data collection, transmission, and storage, often leading to data loss and insufficiency. Synthetic data generation has become a common solution to augment datasets. Existing methods can be broadly categorized into traditional statistical techniques and deep generative approaches. Statistical methods explicitly model observed data, proving advantageous for simple, small-scale synthesis tasks. In contrast, deep generative methods implicitly model data and are capable of generating more complex datasets. Nevertheless, the data synthesized by deep generative models can be uncontrollable, with issues such as mode collapse. This paper proposes a novel data synthesis method based on the deep generative model TimeGAN, aimed at synthesizing multi-dimensional wind power time-series data. TimeGAN combines the architectures of GAN and AE (Autoencoder). The proposed method introduces a parallel structure of TCN (Temporal Convolutional Networks) and Transformer as the backbone of the generator and embedder. Additionally, Wasserstein divergence is used in place of KL (Kullback-Leibler) divergence to calculate loss, effectively mitigating mode collapse during training. Comparative experiments with baseline algorithms, including TimeGAN and diffusion models, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, this work provides new insights into predictive tasks where data collection is difficult or incomplete.},

  abstract={Networks are a huge part of modern life, and cyber security has become a crucial area of research. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device that examines network traffic to confirm security, availability, and integrity. Despite years of research, conventional IDSs continue to struggle with enhancing detection performance, lowering False Alarm Rates (FAR), and identifying novel assaults. Many academics have concentrated on constructing IDSs that leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to overcome the difficulties mentioned above. With extreme accuracy, AI algorithms can reliably identify the main distinctions among normal and anomalous data. Furthermore, AI approaches are very generalizable, allowing them to identify previously undiscovered assaults. IDS methods based on ML, DL, and meta-heuristic optimization have recently been proposed as workable alternatives for spotting intrusions throughout the network. This survey presents an IDS taxonomy that classifies and summarizes AI-based IDS research using data items as the primary dimension. This article offers a thorough analysis of recent studies on the application of AI in IDSs, including surveys and suggestions for cutting-edge techniques. Following that, recent developments and advances in AI-based network IDS are explored, as well as the proposed strategy, assessment metrics, and dataset selection. This study highlighted many research obstacles and presented future direction for research in developing AI-based Network IDS using the inadequacies of the existing approaches.},

  abstract={Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a common head and neck malignancy with distinct clinical management compared to other types of cancer. Precision risk stratification and tailored therapeutic interventions are crucial to improving the survival outcomes. Artificial intelligence, including radiomics and deep learning, has exhibited considerable efficacy in various clinical tasks for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. These techniques leverage medical images and other clinical data to optimize clinical workflow and ultimately benefit patients. In this review, we provide an overview of the technical aspects and basic workflow of radiomics and deep learning in medical image analysis. We then conduct a detailed review of their applications to seven typical tasks in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, covering various aspects of image synthesis, lesion segmentation, diagnosis, and prognosis. The innovation and application effects of cutting-edge research are summarized. Recognizing the heterogeneity of the research field and the existing gap between research and clinical translation, potential avenues for improvement are discussed. We propose that these issues can be gradually addressed by establishing standardized large datasets, exploring the biological characteristics of features, and technological upgrades.},

  abstract={Automatic image annotation, automatic image tagging, and image linguistic indexing functions use methodologies that significantly overlap. In this paper, we use the general term, image captioning, to refer to all forms of such functions. Image captioning is the process of automatically generating metadata in the form of captioning (i.e., generating sentences that describe the content of the image). Image captioning is used in image retrieval systems to locate images of interest from a database, web, or personal devices. In recent years, investigators have been using Deep Learning to caption images with some success. However, the reported results do suffer from a number of deficiencies; namely, accuracy, lack of diversity and emotions in resultant captions. In order to address some of these deficiencies, we propose to use Generative Adversarial models to produce new and combinatorial samples. More specifically, we propose to explore various autoencoders to generate more accurate and meaningful captions for images. Autoencoders are neural networks that learn data codings in an unsupervised manner. The research outlined in this paper is an ongoing investigative research project.},

  abstract={This paper presents the recent advances in deeplearning (DL)-enabled methods for metacell and metalens design. On one hand, metamaterials or metasurfaces have been new opportunities for innovative antenna (metantennas) designs by increasing the degrees of freedom (DoF) in design through introducing new physical properties in antenna design. On the other hand, the increased DoF significantly increases the complexity of design procedure, demanding for new design methods. Prior-knowledge-guided deep-learning-enabled (PK-DL) synthesis method has been then proposed to alleviate this challenge. Prior knowledge is introduced into the conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (cDCGAN) algorithm to guide and speed up the proposed synthesis method. Then, two case studies are presented. The PK-DL synthesis method is first utilized to break the phaseshift limit up to 330 degrees from 308 degrees in existing techniques and improve the 1-dB gain bandwidth of metalens antennas by 52%. Secondly, both amplitude and phase responses of metacells are simultaneously synthesized in a single three-layered metasurface for a metalens antenna, realizing the sidelobe level suppression more than 30 dB. The latest progress demonstrates that the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to metantenna design and AI technologies provide a new opportunity in synthesizing metantennas with outstanding performances and multiple functions.},

AI technologies attempt to mimic human intelligence in nontraditional computing tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and translation. The goal of Prompt Engineering is to maximize the performance of an AI model by providing inputs that leverage its capabilities effectively. It's a skill that combines creativity with an understanding of how AI systems process information. It's particularly relevant for Generative AI models where the input directly shapes the creation of new content, whether it be writing a poem, composing music, coding a software function, or generating a visual image.

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) and Requirements Engineering (RE) intersect in innovative and transformative ways, reshaping how we approach technology development today [1]. On the one hand, AI techniques, e.g., NLP, enhance RE processes by automating the extraction and analysis of requirements, increasing quality, accuracy and efficiency in translating human needs into technical specifications [2]. On the other hand, RE plays a crucial role in developing AI systems themselves; it ensures that AI technologies are designed with clear, well-defined requirements that align with ethical standards and practical user needs [1]. This symbiotic relationship not only advances the capabilities of AI but also ensures that the developed systems are human-centric, reliable and trustworthy [3]. AIRE workshop aims to explore this symbiotic relation to identify complex RE problems that could benefit from applying AI techniques and addressing RE for AI challenges. The 2024 workshop edition received 21 submissions, with each submission independently reviewed by at least three program committee members. The final program consisted of nine papers (seven regular research papers and two short papers) and one lightning talk. The workshop took place on June 25th, 2024. The workshop featured a keynote by Jan-Philipp Steghofer with the title “The proof is in the pudding-Real-world use cases for GenAI for Requirements Engineers.”, and a hands-on session on generative AI in RE. We are very grateful to the Program Committee members and authors of the submissions for their hard work and dedication in putting together this program.

  abstract={The increasing realism of images generated by artificial intelligence (AI) presents new challenges for digital literacy, particularly in distinguishing authentic content from synthetic creations. This paper presents the results of a public online quiz in which participants were asked to distinguish AI-generated images from real photographs. Each of the ten questions featured a pair of images—one original photograph and one AI-generated version created based on a textual description of the original. With over a hundred responses collected, the average score was 5.79 out of 10, with a median of 6, suggesting moderate success but also highlighting the difficulty many users had in discerning AI-generated content. The distribution of results showed a wide range of performance, with most participants scoring between 4 and 8 points. Some images were consistently misclassified, revealing patterns in human perception and AI-generated visual deception. These insights were used to design a workshop for high school and college students on AI in libraries, focusing on visual literacy and critical evaluation of digital media. The workshops include hands-on analysis of real and generated images and discussions on the role of libraries in boosting AI awareness. This paper discusses quiz results, educational strategies, and reflections from student engagement, emphasizing the importance of integrating AI literacy into broader digital education initiatives.},

Currently, AIGC tools on the market exhibit notable variations in their generative characteristics, and they have been widely adopted in fields such as product design, architectural planning, packaging design, and graphic design. However, no AIGC tools are specifically tailored for industrial equipment styling. Each AIGC tool operates on distinct algorithms and generative features, resulting in different output when processing the same content. Therefore, selecting high-quality, accurate AIGC design tools for industrial equipment design remains a challenging problem that requires further exploration.},

Therefore, it impacts education courses where students are required to elaborate on any of these artifacts. In particular, the generation of code affects informatics courses, where assignments usually ask students to develop and deliver programming code. The impact of generative artificial intelligence on informatics courses has been mainly studied for introductory programming courses. These studies have shown that generative artificial intelligence is able to produce highly sophisticated programs, but also that its results and rationale can be inaccurate. Moreover, the impact of generative artificial intelligence has not been studied for other informatics subjects. In this paper, we present our preliminary experience and proposals on three advanced software courses, namely video games, advanced algorithms and language processors. For the video games course, we present the opportunities of use of generative artificial intelligence and the results of a survey conducted with students on their use to obtain different media products. For the algorithms course, we present the result of a session driven by the instructor on different design techniques, showing the merits and demerits of the answers generated. For the language processors course, a proposal of use of generative artificial intelligence is presented, broken down into the parts of a typical language processor. The paper concludes with some suggestions for instructors.},

  abstract={Summary <p>Artificial intelligence (AI)&#x2010;first leaders not only drive technological advancements but also inspire their organizations to thrive in an increasingly AI&#x2010;driven world. Integrating AI into the core business strategy is a fundamental step for AI&#x2010;first leaders. The AI road map should detail the specific AI initiatives to be undertaken, the expected benefits, and the resources required. Resistance to AI adoption often stems from valid concerns about job security, skill obsolescence, and changes to established workflows. Ultimately, the success of AI initiatives lies in their ability to drive measurable impact. AI&#x2010;first leaders have several common characteristics. They are visionary thinkers with a lot of curiosity. That curiosity leads them to seek continuous learning and be adaptable, and agile in their approaches. Ethical and responsible leadership is crucial in the realm of AI. Collaboration and inclusivity are essential traits of AI&#x2010;first leaders.</p>},

  abstract={Teachers' role has evolved over the years in line with the timeline of industrial revolution of the modern world. The period of profound economic and technological change shaped the perception of society on the role of teachers as educators. From the first industrial revolution where we see mass production and growth in factories to the current fourth industrial revolution where we see the integration of artificial intelligence into our everyday living, the role of teachers has also evolved from one who delivers content knowledge to one who designs for learning and champions technology adoption in the classroom. The evolution of teachers' role demands that teachers be able to adapt to changes and equip themselves with relevant knowledge and skills to carry out their roles to the basic expectation of the modern society, and this includes equipping themselves with the knowledge and skills in navigating the highly pervasive educational technology used in classroom today, post pandemic, the Generative AI (Gen AI). Teachers are expected to have the digital competence to effectively create a conducive personalized learning environment for the students. This paper will explore how teachers' perception of their role in this era of Gen AI, influence their use of Gen AI in the classroom.},

  abstract={With the intensification of conflicts in different regions, the W-band suspicious object detection system is an essential security means to prevent terrorist attacks and is widely used in many crucial places such as airports. Because artificial intelligence can perform highly reliable and accurate services in the field of image recognition, it is used in suspicious object detection systems to increase the recognition rate for suspicious objects. However, it is challenging to establish a complete suspicious object database, and obtaining sufficient millimeter-wave images of suspicious objects from experiments for AI training is not realistic. To address this issue, this paper verifies the feasibility to generate a large number of millimeter-wave images for AI training by generative adversarial networks. Moreover, we also evaluate the factors that affect the AI recognition rate when the original images used for CNN training are insufficient and how to increase the service quality of AI-based W-band suspicious object detection systems for moving persons. In parallel, all the international standardization organizations have been collectively advancing the novel technologies of AI. We update the reader with information about AI research and standardization related activities in this paper.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) based technologies have deeply changed people's daily lives. There are many AI-based applications used in industrial scenarios such as Internet of Things (IoT), smart grids, and edge computing. Although bringing AI into industrial scenarios could improve the performance in many aspects, new security and privacy issues are also introduced consequently. Subsequently, machine learning technologies require a training process which introduces the protection problems in the training data and algorithms. As many machine learning and deep learning models are vulnerable against well-designed adversarial input samples, outsourcing data and algorithms for training will require the integrity of the training data. Also, data privacy of the end users must be protected. On the other hand, traditional solutions for industrial system security could also be enhanced by these AI schemes. The papers in this special section focus on emerging privacy and security issues brought by Artificial Intelligence in industrial informatics.},

Thomson Reuters also offers GenAI&#x2010;powered contract review software called &#x201c;Document Intelligence,&#x201d; which it says can cut the amount of time spent searching for information in contracts by 50%. In particular, GenAI can be used to review legal documents and cases, analyze contracts, draft documents, prepare depositions, and write communications. Several GenAI platforms and tools are emerging to serve the legal profession. GenAI can also help to make legal advice more accessible to everyday people, thanks to new tools that offer simple legal advice, and help with translating complex legal jargon into everyday language. Such tools can even help people draw up contracts without having to hire a lawyer.</p>},

  abstract={SAR image simulation plays an important role in the process of SAR target interpretation and recognition, especially when the number of SAR images is limited. Due to the restriction of acquisition process, the numbers of SAR target images are always insufficient. The traditional SAR image simulation, which is based on calculation of electromagnetic theory, is easily to be affected by parameter distortion due to the lack of joint optimization. Consequently, it makes a big effect on the quality of the simulated images. This paper presents a novel approach, end-to-end models, to simulate the desired images from the SAR image database. A series of generative adversarial networks include DCGAN, weight clipping WGAN and WGAN with gradient penalty are optimized and applied to generate typical SAR target images. Three kinds of network structures are used, include structure of DCGAN, newly proposed structure of four residual blocks networks and Resnet. Experimental results show that the proposed novel method is not only efficient for SAR image simulation, but also can generate excellent SAR images. Furthermore, we analysis the results and the characteristics of different networks, which pave a good way for SAR image simulation based on artificial intelligence method.},

  abstract={This work introduces House Plan AI, an AI system that generates 2D house plans automatically from user-specified requirements like room types, spatial relationships, and dimensions. T5 and LLaMA models are used to process natural language inputs, and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) is used to manage the spatial layout of rooms. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) produces realistic floor plan images from structured data. The dataset used contains 1500 house plans based on AutoCAD, which were preprocessed by confirming dimensions, eliminating unwanted objects such as furniture, converting to JPG, and resizing to 512×512 via a padding technique. One of the significant features of the system is that it has a cost estimation module in which the Gemini API is employed for the extraction of text and dimension data from uploaded house plans. This information is then utilized to estimate the cost of construction, including items such as steel, RCC belts, rubble work, and fittings, and the results are displayed via a graphical split of costs. A Streamlit-based user interface facilitates login support for users, contractors, and dealers so that they can generate and download plans, see estimates of costs, and allocate work based on reviews. The suggested solution cuts down substantially the time and expense involved in conventional architectural processes, providing a cost-effective, scalable platform for custom home design.},

  abstract={This study presents the results of an analysis on the perception of secondary education teachers in the Dominican Republic regarding the use of emerging technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), in their classroom practices. It also identifies the barriers and ethical risks associated with their integration. An online survey was administered to a sample of 754 teachers, using a questionnaire validated by expert judgment and with high reliability ${(\alpha=0.941)}$. The results showed a high level of adoption of technological tools, with the most commonly used being Quizizz, ChatGPT, Padlet, and Kahoot!. Gamification was perceived as the tool with the greatest benefits for student learning and motivation, while generative AI text raised concerns about its potential negative impact on cognitive development. The lack of access to equipment and resources, as well as the need for teacher training, were identified as the main barriers to implementation. Additionally, ethical concerns related to data privacy and security, especially in the case of generative AI text, were evident. The findings suggest the need for further reflection and discussion on the ethical risks of these technologies within the educational community, as well as the design of policies and teacher training programs that promote their effective and responsible use.},

  pages={760-765},
  abstract={This paper aims to explore the application of computer artificial intelligence technology in the field of visual communication design, especially the research and development of intelligent poster generation system. We propose an innovative algorithm that integrates the benefits of variational autoencoders (VAE) and generative adversarial networks (Gans) to enable more efficient and flexible poster design generation. As a powerful generative model, variational autoencoders can generate new samples by learning potential representations of data. The generative adversarial network, with its excellent generative ability and adversarial training mechanism, has made remarkable achievements in the field of image generation. By integrating the two, we have built an intelligent system capable of capturing complex features of poster designs and producing diverse, high-quality posters. In the algorithm implementation, we use variational autoencoder to encode the poster design data and extract the potential feature representation. These features are then fed into a generator in the generative adversarial network to generate a new poster design through adversarial training. At the same time, we designed an efficient loss function to balance the diversity and authenticity of the generated posters. The experimental results show that the algorithm has excellent performance in poster design generation. It can not only generate creative and personalized posters, but also customize the design according to user needs. In addition, the algorithm also shows good generalization ability when dealing with different styles and themes of poster design. In the future, we will continue to optimize algorithms, explore more application scenarios, and promote the deep integration of computer artificial intelligence and visual communication design.},

Adversarial attacks pose a threat to the reliability of AI systems by adding tiny perturbations to the input data to mislead the model and lead to wrong prediction results. This paper offers an exhaustive overview of adversarial attacks, encompassing their definitions, taxonomies, and the methodologies for crafting adversarial examples. A comparative analysis of the strengths and weaknesses inherent to different adversarial examples generation techniques is presented, alongside an exposition of their critical influence on the security landscape of deep learning technologies.

  abstract={This review examines the ethical, social, and technical challenges posed by AI-generated text tools, focusing on their rapid advancement and widespread adoption. An exhaustive literature search across many databases, strict inclusion/exclusion criteria, and a rigorous analysis procedure are all parts of our systematic review technique. This guarantees an impartial and complete study of the current status of AI-generated text tools. The study analyzes prominent language models, including GPT-3, GPT-4, LaMDA, PaLM, Claude, Jasper, and Llama 2, evaluating their capabilities in natural language processing and generation. The analysis reveals significant advancements, with GPT-3 demonstrating a 92% accuracy rate on standard natural language understanding benchmarks, outperforming LaMDA (88%) and PaLM (85%). To illustrate real-world implications, the review presents a case study of ChatGPT’s application in healthcare, where it achieved 80% consistency with expert opinions in assessing acute ulcerative colitis. This case highlights both the potential benefits and ethical concerns of AI in critical domains. Quantitative bias analysis shows that GPT-3 generated biased content in 15% of test cases involving sensitive topics, a higher rate than LaMDA (12%) and PaLM (10%). We provide an in-depth analysis of fairness and bias issues, particularly in image generation tasks depicting professional roles. Our research synthesizes insights from technical advancements, ethical considerations, and real-world applications across healthcare, education, and creative sectors. We address critical privacy concerns and data protection challenges, noting struggles in AI-generated text detection and investigating AI’s potential in enabling cyberattacks. We underscore the need for comprehensive governance systems and multidisciplinary cooperation. To provide a cohesive analysis of the ethical considerations surrounding AI-generated text tools, we employ a multifaceted ethical framework drawing on established theories. Utilitarianism, which seeks to maximize happiness for everyone; deontology, which places an emphasis on right and wrong; and Virtue Ethics, which analyzes the moral nature of deeds and actors, are all included in this framework. In this article, we use this approach to investigate AI ethics from a variety of angles, including privacy, prejudice, and social implications, as well as concerns of justice and fairness. Moreover, the study critically examines existing and proposed legal frameworks addressing AI ethics, identifying regulatory gaps and proposing adaptive policy recommendations to address the unique challenges posed by AI-generated text tools. Our review contributes a critical analysis of AI-generated text tools, their impacts, and the need for responsible innovation. The study provides precise guidelines for the ethical development and implementation of AI, highlighting the need to strike a balance between technical progress and ethical concerns to guarantee that AI technologies have a beneficial effect on society while protecting human values. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) signifies a substantial revolution in our methods of interacting with language and information.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={133-137},
  abstract={This study proposes an algorithm for detecting suspicious behaviors in large payment flows based on deep generative models. By combining Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE), the algorithm is designed to detect abnormal behaviors in financial transactions. First, the GAN is used to generate simulated data that approximates normal payment flows. The discriminator identifies anomalous patterns in transactions, enabling the detection of potential fraud and money laundering behaviors. Second, a VAE is introduced to model the latent distribution of payment flows, ensuring that the generated data more closely resembles real transaction features, thus improving the model’s detection accuracy. The method optimizes the generative capabilities of both GAN and VAE, ensuring that the model can effectively capture suspicious behaviors even in sparse data conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional machine learning algorithms and other deep learning models across various evaluation metrics, especially in detecting rare fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, this study provides a detailed comparison of performance in recognizing different transaction patterns (such as normal, money laundering, and fraud) in large payment flows, validating the advantages of generative models in handling complex financial data.},

  abstract={The interest of artificial intelligence (AI) and mobile edge computing (MEC) has increased in recent years. As a fundamental building block for the development of mobile edge computing, new techniques are needed in the mobile network. Driven by the techniques of Internet of Things (IoT) and AI, MEC, as an emerging paradigm, enables cloud services and AI frontier in close proximity to users, by pushing computing and cache resources from the cloud to the network edge. With the continuous and in-depth research on intelligent mobile networks, green edge intelligence would be a new paradigm of MEC. AI is playing a more important role in the mobile edge computing. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of recent work on AI and MEC. Specially, we first review the various AI techniques. We then propose a novel concept of green edge intelligence. Finally, by using a case study on edge caching with AI techniques, we demonstrate the thrilling effectiveness of AI. We hope that this paper can provide researchers a meaningful guidance and inspire further research interests on green edge intelligence.},

  abstract={With the development of artificial intelligence and cryptography, intelligent cryptography will be the trend of encrypted communications in the future. Abadi designed an encrypted communication model based on a generative adversarial network, which can communicate securely when the adversary knows the ciphertext. The communication party and the adversary fight against each other to continuously improve their own capabilities to achieve a state of secure communication. However, this model can only have a better communication effect under the 16 bits communication length, and cannot adapt to the length of modern encrypted communication. Combine the neural network structure in DCGAN to optimize the neural network of the original model, and at the same time increase the batch normalization process, and optimize the loss function in the original model. Experiments show that under the condition of the maximum 2048-bit communication length, the decryption success rate of communication reaches about 0.97, while ensuring that the adversary’s guess error rate is about 0.95, and the training speed is greatly increased to keep it below 5000 steps, ensuring safety and efficiency Communication.},

  abstract={Generative adverse Networks (GANs) have become increasingly famous for a variety of tasks in picture and audio processing, especially unsupervised getting to know. GANs encompass components, a “generator” and a “discriminator,” that are skilled adversarial. The generator is tasked with producing a pattern of statistics, and the discriminator is tasked with figuring out whether the information is “actual” or “fake.” The generator “learns” through trial and mistakes as it attempts to create samples that appear practical to the discriminator. Through the antagonistic schooling manner, the generator can create more accurate “fake” records while the discriminator can emerge as better at distinguishing between “actual” and “faux” records. GANs have been applied to various duties, which include picture era, textual content to photosynthesis, photo-to-image translation, and automatic music composition. Recent tries have been made to apply GANs to extra complicated obligations in the wild, including self-reliant use and drug discovery. GANs have inspired an ever-developing quantity of industries because of their potential to generate sensible facts with minimal human input.},

  abstract={The infectious disease tuberculosis (TB) continues to pose a serious risk to global health specially in developing world. There are over 10 million new cases of tuberculosis each year. Machine and deep learning models are trained to recognize specific pixels inside a medical image for the purposes of classification and disease progression tracking, however the decision-making mechanism of these models is hidden from the user. In this context, Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) refers to strategies that allow humans to understand the results of AI algorithms. Recently, a variety of XAI methods for classification and generative have been proposed; however, these methods only use a subset of most discriminative power characteristics, resulting in false positives. This article proposes CycleGAN-based multi-functional generative adversarial networks to efficiently solve these challenges. Proposed model is trained in weakly supervised context to identify and visualize the disease effects and finally generate binary mask in data augmentation context. The model takes a Chest radiography (CXR) as input, creates a change map showing the disease's effect at a specific spot, and then uses this map to create a binary mask of original image. Results on publicly available TB dataset, TBX11K, confirm that the proposed model produces highly accurate result.},

  abstract={The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and HumanComputer Interaction (HCI) has grown significantly in the last decade. Speech Recognition (SR) and more specifically Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is still a growing field with quite a few academic and private companies doing research. Currently, SER is not specifically geared toward African-based languages. The paper is to show how to create an Afrikaans-based speech corpora to train a Neural Network (NN). Method-wise, speech samples are extracted from streamed broadcasts. A local Afrikaans Youtube channel is used. Care is taken that the ‘‘Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)’’ is always adhered to. In cases where the creative commons license is not available, authorization has been obtained. The speech clips are saved in.wav format. The emotions captured are Anger, Anticipation, Disgust, Joy, Sadness, Suprise, Fear and Trust. All data is anonymized. The recorded clips are verified by a second independent party and if required verified again by another. This makes sure that categorization is correct. The result is an Afrikaans speech corpus with roughly 800 speech clips. Finally, LTSM is applied to the dataset, and the new Afrikaans corpora yielded a detection accuracy of 58% and 74% with transfer learning.},

  pages={725-729},
  abstract={Decentralized governance is going through radical changes due to the innovative use of blockchain which allows decisions to be made in a transparent, secure and more im- portantly, immutable way, without the authority of a single individual or party. Thus, the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) in blockchain governing systems complicates such thing as transparency and trust, especially in the case of deep AI systems. But more on this later – this is where Explainable AI or XAI comes into the picture. XAI methods enable understanding of the reasons behind the choices made by AI models and solves the "black box" problem that is predominant in machine learn- ing. When applied to decentralised governance, XAI provides clarifications of AI’s decision making in such areas as voting, resource distribution and the enactment of smart contracts. This way, the stakeholders are confident that the decision-making is fair and impartial and this is made possible by the use of XAI. This paper aims to find out more about the applicability of XAI concept in blockchain –based governance systems in terms of bias and fairness in automated decisions and explanation of the decisions made. The reasons why interpretability plays the crucial role in decentralized systems are explained with the help of the comparison between the classical artificial intelligence and the Xin Intelligent. The study also looks at various use cases such as, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), and voting systems implemented on blockchain platforms and how XAI can enhance the performance of the governance systems. As this study shows, XAI is vital in building trust, improving responsibility, and guaranteeing balanced majorities in decentralized blockchain governance structures.},

  abstract={The artificial intelligence (AI) space has been revolutionized recently by the advent of generative AI models that allow machine-generated content to appear visually identical to content generated by real people. The newly emerging field employs a variety of techniques and architectures to produce different kinds of outputs, ranging from text and images to music and full synthetic environments. One of the most popular paradigms of such field is the family of generative models, and, recently, the subfamily of large language models (LLMs). Thus, generative AI, including LLMs, is based on the conception of probability distribution. This is when technology feds many datasets and learns the patterns and laws that hide under that data, enabling the AI to write effectively. LLMs have been used to schedule and seed texts naturally across various domains, from training transformer-like models, to code prototyping, writing, and journal narration. Thus, to resolve the challenges associated with it, an integrated nature of modeling with the training techniques is evolved, which eventually follows all the rules, regulations, as well as guidelines that help in successful implementation of generative models and LLMs.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized medical imaging, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy via the evaluation of X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. However, the effectiveness of AI models is hindered due to high costs, privacy concerns, and challenges in acquiring large annotated datasets. Artificial data generation techniques, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and hybrid models like Disc-VAE, have gained prominence in dealing with these barriers. These techniques aim to augment datasets while preserving the complicated capabilities inherent to medical images. This paper compares the efficacy of Vector Quantized VAE with GAN and Disc-VAE using metrics Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). The Vector Quantized VAE outperforms GAN and Disc-VAE in terms of SSIM and PSNR metrics. The findings spotlight the transformative capability of synthetic information augmentation for the medical system by enabling early and accurate disease diagnosis. These improved SSIM and PSNR metrics suggest that the generated images preserve essential diagnostic details, thereby enhancing the potential for early and accurate clinical diagnosis. It guarantees advanced performance and robustness of AI models, facilitating timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Students’ decision-making related to attending college for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees and retaining them within those fields continue to be of focus, especially when considering the national goal of satisfying industry, private, and public sector workforce needs. This is particularly important when considering growing national security concerns and ongoing high cybersecurity and climate change workforce demands. However, despite concerted efforts, low enrollment and student attrition continue to be a challenge, even more so since the onset of the global pandemic. Simultaneously, the utilization of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has seen a sharp increase since 2022 by various stakeholders, most notably college students. Additionally, faculty are encouraged by their higher education institutions to incorporate these tools within classrooms for several reasons, including demands from industry for students to gain knowledge and experience with generative AI tools. Given the importance of understanding the ongoing issue of STEM degree attrition and the increasing utilization of generative AI, this research study explored these two areas using ChatGPT, one of the world's most utilized generative AI language models, within the process. The first research question (RQ#l) is: What is the top reason why students do notfinish college? The response provided solely emphasized finances and/or financial constraints. Based on that answer, the second research question (RQ #2) was: Is getting a college degree worth the cost? RQ #2 was explored to allow a deeper understanding of the initial research question from a different angle. Both questions were analyzed through the lens of two theoretical frameworks, the human capital theory and the principal-agent theory, and results were compared to the literature as a form of research validation. This research study is essential as there is an ongoing increase in the utilization of generative AI in homes, K-12 institutions, and higher education for everyday knowledge, formal and informal education. When considering that soon-to-be and current college students may be using these generative AI tools to make decisions related to pursuing and/or retaining their educational status, it is essential to explore how generative AI system outputs align with what has been researched and documented in the literature. Therefore, this research study explored the application of ChatGPT and the system's responses to research questions as a form of document analysis and analyzed those results using triangulation as a form of validation. The analysis and results of this study contributed directly to the recommendations and feedback to the owners of ChatGPT - OpenAI. Additionally, the results highlighted a need for increased focus on AI ethics related to data input, data output, access to the system, and who has a seat at the table as the company recommends, approves, and implements changes. Limitations of this study are provided along with an overarching concluding statement.},

  abstract={<p>Defining Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not easy as AI is a young discipline. However, the field of AI got officially defined in 1956 with a workshop organized by John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project. The goal of this conference was to investigate ways in which machines could be made to simulate aspects of intelligence. In 1965, computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA, an early conversational AI program capable of natural language interaction. Though intended to showcase the superficiality of communication between humans and artificial intelligence, ELIZA's uncannily human&#x2010;like responses led many to curiously anthropomorphize its underlying system. The possibility to use massive volumes of data changed everything and triggered a new boom supported by the Big Data era, the access to large amounts of data, cheaper and faster computers, and progress on machine learning.</p>},

  abstract={This study examines the impact of the fishbone digital Learning Design (FDLD) approach on engineering curriculum design and explores the role of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) as a peer evaluator. Using Tyler's goal-focused model, GenAI (XIPU AI) simulated the roles of teachers, curriculum committee members, and novice teachers to evaluate FDLD-based design versus traditional design in an undergraduate Artificial intelligence and programming course (Module M). The results show that FDLD significantly improves the clarity of learning objectives through diverse interactive activities (such as experiments, collaborative tasks) and balanced summative assessments consistent with Bloom's classification. GenAI provides a structured, objective assessment that validates the FDLD's adaptability to novice teachers and its consistency with institutional standards. The findings highlight the efficacy of FDLD in promoting higher-order thinking and the potential of GenAI as a scalable evaluator.},

  year={2023},
  volume={4},

  pages={1076-1088},
  abstract={A myriad of recent literary works have leveraged generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate unseen evasion samples. The purpose is to annex the generated data with the original train set for adversarial training to improve the detection performance of machine learning (ML) classifiers. The quality of generated adversarial samples relies on the adequacy of training data samples. However, in low data regimes like medical diagnostic imaging and cybersecurity, the anomaly samples are scarce in number. This paper proposes a novel GAN design called evasion generative adversarial network (EVAGAN) that is more suitable for low data regime problems that use oversampling for detection improvement of ML classifiers. EVAGAN not only can generate evasion samples but its discriminator can act as an evasion-aware classifier. We have considered auxiliary classifier GAN (ACGAN) as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of EVAGAN on cybersecurity (ISCX-2014, CIC-2017, and CIC2018) botnet and computer vision (MNIST) datasets. We demonstrate that EVAGAN outperforms ACGAN for unbalanced datasets with respect to detection performance, training stability, and time complexity. EVAGAN's generator quickly learns to generate the low sample class and hardens its discriminator simultaneously. In contrast to ML classifiers that require security hardening after being adversarially trained by GAN-generated data, EVAGAN renders it needless. The experimental analysis proves that EVAGAN is an efficient evasion hardened model for low data regimes for the selected cybersecurity and computer vision datasets.},

  abstract={With the development of information technology, teaching reforms have been innovated, and the quality of university programs has become higher and higher. However, the emergence and widespread application of deep generative models have brought more challenges and opportunities to classroom teaching. With the continuous development of educational technology and the updating of teaching concepts, the depth generation model, as an emerging teaching mode, is gradually receiving attention from the educational community. In order to verify the effectiveness of the depth generation model, this study selected a certain number of college English classes as experimental subjects, and conducted in-depth data analysis and discussion by comparing the differences between the experimental group and the control group in terms of the frequency of interactions, the quality of interactions, the degree of student participation and learning effects. By comparing the classroom effects of using a deep generative modelling classroom with a traditional classroom, the study found that students’ overall grades in English classrooms using deep generative modelling improved by approximately 31 points, and that the average completion rate of assignments in deep generative modelling classrooms was 94.8%, which was much higher than that of traditional classrooms.},
