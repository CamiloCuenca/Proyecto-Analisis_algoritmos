  abstract={Satellite communication offers the prospect of service continuity over uncovered and under-covered areas, service ubiquity, and service scalability. However, several challenges must first be addressed to realize these benefits, as the resource management, network control, network security, spectrum management, and energy usage of satellite networks are more challenging than that of terrestrial networks. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, has been steadily growing as a research field and has shown successful results in diverse applications, including wireless communication. In particular, the application of AI to a wide variety of satellite communication aspects has demonstrated excellent potential, including beam-hopping, anti-jamming, network traffic forecasting, channel modeling, telemetry mining, ionospheric scintillation detecting, interference managing, remote sensing, behavior modeling, space-air-ground integrating, and energy managing. This work thus provides a general overview of AI, its diverse sub-fields, and its state-of-the-art algorithms. Several challenges facing diverse aspects of satellite communication systems are then discussed, and their proposed and potential AI-based solutions are presented. Finally, an outlook of field is drawn, and future steps are suggested.},

  abstract={The impulse of so many organizations across nearly every sector of society to promulgate principles in response to the ascendance of artificial intelligence is understandable and predictable. There is some utility in public commitments to universal values in the context of AI, and common principles can lay a foundation for societal change. But ultimately what is missing is not knowledge about the content of ethics as much as political will. If, as both detractors and proponents claim, AI constitutes the transformative technology of our time, then one of the aspects of society that must transform is the law and legal institutions.},

  abstract={In the rapidly evolving domain of healthcare, the availability of large and diverse datasets is paramount for the development and validation of advanced algorithms. However, the acquisition of such data is often hindered by privacy concerns, limited patient cohorts, and the inherent variability in medical conditions. This research delves into the potential of Deep Generative Models (DGMs) as a solution for synthetic data generation in healthcare applications. We present a comprehensive study of various DGM architectures, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Normalizing Flows, and their efficacy in generating high-fidelity medical images. Our experiments demonstrate that these models can produce synthetic data that retains the intricate features of real medical images while ensuring patient privacy. Furthermore, when used as augmentation in training diagnostic algorithms, the synthetic data generated by our proposed models showed a significant improvement in the generalization capabilities of these algorithms. This work not only underscores the potential of DGMs in addressing the data scarcity issue in healthcare but also paves the way for their broader application in medical research, training, and diagnostics.},

  abstract={Establishing endogenous intelligence capabilities within telecommunication networks in the form of native artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a significant topic of research for promoting the prospects of 6th Generation (6G) networks. In the upcoming 6G era, the network is expected to provide services for building and deploying distributed AI applications in the network infrastructure, and such applications will be used solely by the network or offered to operators or third parties as new services. This paper begins by analysing the current status of standardisation in the network AI domain, and next elaborates on the major shortcomings of the current approaches for natively setting up network AI services. On this basis, we present the concept of Native Network Generative AI (NNGAI), which builds on and further advances the concept of native AI for telecom networks. To formulate the paradigm of NNGAI, we first devise the network architecture, and then finally the underlying logical flow of network services to realize NNGAI by carefully inserting generative AI technologies into both the architecture and the service flow of 6G networks.},

  pages={95368-95389},
  abstract={The increasing integration of ChatGPT, a Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) model, into educational environments has sparked substantial ethical concerns. This paper addresses the crucial question of whether to impose restrictions or legislate the usage of Gen-AI, with ChatGPT as a pivotal case study. Through systematic literature review and frequency of occurrence analysis, 10 ethical concerns were selected for further analysis using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The analysis responses of 10 expert panels show that the top concerns, as revealed by their weights, after meeting the consistency requirement, include copyright, legal, and compliance issues (0.1731), privacy and confidentiality (0.1286), academic integrity (0.1206), incorrect reference and citation practices (0.1111), and safety and security concerns (0.1050). Evaluating the impact of these concerns on the policy alternatives (restriction and legislation), the findings revealed that “Restriction” received a higher weight (0.513712) compared to “Legislation” (0.485887). Notably, copyright, legal, and compliance issues, privacy and confidentiality, and academic integrity emerged as crucial factors influencing the decision between restriction and legislation. This study offers valuable insights for educational institutions and policymakers, suggesting the need for inclusive discussions, pilot programs to assess impacts on critical thinking, development of clear guidelines, flexible regulatory frameworks, awareness campaigns, and potential strategies for ethical and responsible use.},

  abstract={The rise of Artificial Intelligence for Science (AI4S) has highlighted the importance and urgency of ensuring open-ness, fairness, impartiality, diversity, and sustainability in scientific systems. Existing scientific systems, referred to as Centralized Science (CeSci), are built on centralized organizational structures and top-down institutional frameworks, which are lagging behind the development and practical requirements of AI4S. To address these limitations, AI4S needs to embrace a new scientific organizational and operational paradigm, namely Decentralized Science (DeSci). It can provide strong support to AI4S via effectively addressing issues such as information silos, biases, unfair distribution, and monopolies and promoting multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and trans disciplinary cooperation in science. Based on these considerations, this paper presents the framework of AI4S based on DeSci and explores its potential application scenarios and research issues. The research can provide effective guidance for the development of scientific systems.},

  abstract={Interest has been growing over the past number of years in the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to aid in cancer diagnosis. However, the requirement for extensive training data to train these AI models presents a significant challenge. This paper proposes a viable solution to this issue by synthesising images to augment the real data in the training dataset. We investigate the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in generating high-quality tissue images for both colon and prostate. The datasets we use are from the TCGA repository and contain various cancerous diseases for both colon and prostate. We outline how the data was pre-processed, and quality controlled and we also delineate the relevant experiments applied. We apply some of the most recent GAN architectures in ProGAN and StyleGAN to generate synthetic colon tissue images, achieving a literature-high Fréchet Inception Score (FID) score of 6.019 for colon tissue images and an FID score of 3.03 for prostate tissue images. Notably, the synthetic images produced were deemed indistinguishable from real samples when assessed by a practicing consultant histopathologist. By addressing the challenge of limited training data, our approach could ultimately contribute to earlier detection and improved treatment outcomes for cancer patients worldwide.},

  abstract={The increasing number of international students (IS) enrolled in Australian higher education institutions, combined with the widespread adoption of online and hybrid learning, has significant implications for understanding the factors that influence engagement among this diverse student group. Early identification of students with low engagement facilitates academic success, prevents poor outcomes, optimizes resource allocation, improves teaching strategies, increases motivation, and supports long-term success. This study's main aim is to examine the use of AI to predict student engagement. Development of a theoretically informed survey that aimed to elicit postgraduate students' engagement was developed and validated by expert judgment. In total, 200 copies of the survey were distributed, 121 responses were received, and 96 were considered for this study representing a response rate of 48%. This study promotes a multidimensional approach, utilizing AI and ML methodologies, to determine the influence of social and cultural contexts on student engagement. This approach enables educators and institutions to create effective strategies for enhancing the learning experience of postgraduate students. Multiple AI and ML techniques have been utilized including synthetic data generation methods such GaussianCopula, triplet-based variational autoencoder, generative adversarial networks, CopulaGAN, and conditional tabular generative adversarial network. These techniques are specifically employed to predict various dimensions of engagement, including personal, academic, intellectual, social, and professional engagement. The performance of AI/ML algorithms, including support vector machine, K-nearest neighbors, decision trees, gradient boosting machine, random forest, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, and extra trees, was assessed using several metrics including F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, confusion matrix, and accuracy. The models used in this study achieved up to 85% accuracy, offering a solid foundation for guidelines and support to enhance decision making processes in higher education. These findings provide valuable insights for both academics and policy makers, laying the groundwork for evidence-based strategies to improve student engagement.},

  abstract={In the contemporary engineering landscape, the complexity and interconnectivity of systems have given rise to the concept of Systems of Systems (SoS), wherein multiple independent systems collaborate to achieve a higher-order functionality not possible by any single component system alone. The engineering of SoS, or System of Systems Engineering (SoSE), presents unique challenges that necessitate novel approaches for design, integration, and management for connecting systems into SoS. Additionally, SoS capabilities can be further leveraged using the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which has yet to be fully explored. This paper introduces an innovative framework leveraging AI to address the complex demands of SoSE. The framework itself has been developed using a systematic domain analysis method. The framework incorporates a metamodel, a Matrix Chart for aligning AI technologies with specific SoS capabilities, and a systematic method for their application across different stages of the SoS lifecycle. To validate our framework, we employ a multi-case study methodology, examining diverse SoS examples across industries. These case studies demonstrate the practicality and impact of the presented proposed AI-driven approach in real-world SoSE challenges. The framework is used to depict a useful map to pave the way for further research and innovations.},

  abstract={The generative pretrained transformer (GPT) models, renowned for generating human-like text, occasionally produce “hallucinations”—outputs that diverge from human expectations. Current mitigation strategies for these GPT hallucinations largely rely on algorithmic automation, thereby overlooking the complexities of human judgment and cultural influence, particularly in fact interpretation. Addressing this issue, we have introduced a Culturally Sensitive Test that integrates language subjectivity, cultural nuances, and GPT idiosyncrasies. We have applied this test to five GPT models—OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4, Google's Bard, Perplexity AI, and TruthGPT—evaluating their responses to 70 questions across seven categories designed to provoke hallucinations. The evaluated models demonstrated varying performance, with controversial topics, those lacking clear scientific consensus and the brain teasers proving more susceptible to GPT hallucinations. Our study has paved the way for a nuanced assessment of GPT hallucinations.},

To carry out this transition process, it will be necessary to develop clear guidelines that adhere to integrity standards and ethical codes of higher education institutions. In addition to offering responses to a number of research questions, the purpose of this study is to further the current discourse surrounding the moral guidelines for GAI in higher education. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) technique and Bibliometric Analysis using VOSviewer, 37 related research studies were reviewed and evaluated. The results demonstrate that the number of articles published has been increasing over time, with the largest number of scientific publications occurring in 2024. This can be explained by the fact that, despite the fact that GAI offers benefits and drawbacks for the educational sector, particularly for higher education, it also makes clear how important it is for professionals and organizations to use GAI tools in order to handle ethical issues by continuously developing policies. By creating norms and policies, future ethical problems with GAI in education may be more accurately predicted. The engagement and dedication of academic experts and other relevant stakeholders are essential to achieving this goal of increasing public awareness and effectively utilizing GAI technology.},

  abstract={The rapid evolution of generative artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational landscapes., particularly in computer science education. This study investigates research trends in generative AI applications through text network and topic modeling analyses. A comprehensive literature review across IEEE Xplore., Scopus., and Web of Science identified 151 studies published between 2023 and 2024. Text network analysis revealed that “AI.,” “student.,” “education.,” “learning.,” and “performance” were the most frequently occurring terms., highlighting key research themes. Ego-network analysis demonstrated strong interconnectivity between educational AI tools and student learning outcomes. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)., four major research topics emerged: educational chatbots (35.1 %)., AI literacy (25.8%)., exam performance (21.8%)., and technology integration (17.2%). Findings indicate a dominant focus on chatbots for student engagement., while ethical concerns and multimodal AI applications remain underexplored. The study underscores the necessity of addressing AI literacy gaps and enhancing interdisciplinary AI integration in educational settings. Despite its potential., generative AI adoption is hindered by privacy risks., uneven technological access., and the lack of standardized policies. Future research should focus on ethical AI frameworks., multimodal AI tools., and long-term learning outcomes. This study provides a data-driven foundation for understanding the evolving role of generative AI in education and its implications for educators., policymakers., and researchers.},

  abstract={Generative AI transforms education by making learning experiences better and more personalized. GAI overcomes some of the problems in traditional teaching by providing tools like ChatGPT and GANs, which create smart learning systems, design instructional materials, and provide interactive, engaging experiences. GAI is the key to supporting educators to automate resources, provide personal content, and focus on creativity and critical thinking. Its size of growth and adaptability can fill in any kind of knowledge gap, specifically in distressful regions for applications related to skill development, translation of languages, medical learning, and virtual teaching. Interoperability with VR and the metaverse modernizes education further. The issues in this are data collection, biases in algorithms, and the human interaction is reduced. That would require explainable algorithms and robust data protection. Policymakers, educators, and technologists must be in a joint effort to see that GAI is used justly. Democratized education, lifelong learning, and inclusive future promises GAI as they blend technology with pedagogy to reap maximum benefits and risks.},

  abstract={The paper is dedicated to the philosophical analysis of the specifics of artificial intelligence and its relation to human intelligence, as well as of the very notion of generative artificial intelligence and its abilities and inabilities. Emphasis is placed on such feature of human thinking as openness, which is argued to clearly distinguish it from machine thinking, as well as on such aspects of human intelligence as nonlinearity, morality, emotionality and evaluation that could be described as extra-rational and thus unobtainable for the artificial intelligence. It is argued that artificial intelligence cannot think openly, “out of the box”, going beyond the boundaries of purely rational reasoning and formal logic peculiar to classical type of rationality. The authors also conclude that the development of AI-based technologies makes it necessary to shift the higher education in the direction of strengthening the emphasis on the ethical, emotional, and volitional sphere of human intelligence.},

  abstract={AI Art Generators have recently developed in such a way that they have become accessible to everyone who has access to the internet. This paper looks into how the modern AI art generators work and identifies the various issues with AI art on technical, moral and legal grounds. Furthermore it aims to understands how the increased accessibility to AI art generators affects humans.Modern AI art generators use artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms and deep neural network algorithms to study a large amount of pre-existing artworks in portfolio and produce new art based on the prompts provided by the user. They use software such as CNN, GAN, NST.The biggest argument against AI art is that it needs the human creativity and imagination. But it has been argued that the human creativity is included in the text prompts provided by the artist. AI art generators have also been accused of stealing art works without permission of the artists which has been leading to some copyright issues. Furthermore AI art generators have been stealing artists’ commissions and work. AI art generators are not perfect yet and have several errors such as errors in the art generated such as anatomy errors(example: hands with six fingers instead of five etc). Artists have protested against the use of AI art generators. One such protest is the "No to AI generated images" movement wherein they flooded the portfolio in an AI art generator called "ArtStation" with images tagged as "trending in ArtStation in order to render all the generated images useless.},

  abstract={Mental disorders show a rapid increase and cause considerable harm to individuals as well as the society in recent decade. Hence, mental disorders have become a serious public health challenge in nowadays society. Timely treatment of mental disorders plays a critical role for reducing the harm of mental illness to individuals and society. Music therapy is a type of non-pharmaceutical method in treating such mental disorders. However, conventional music therapy suffers from a number of issues resulting in a lack of popularity. Thanks to the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially the AI Generated Content (AIGC), it provides a chance to address these issues. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no work investigating music therapy from AIGC and closed-loop perspective. In this paper, we summarise some universal music therapy methods and discuss their shortages. Then, we indicate some AIGC techniques, especially the music generation, for their application in music therapy. Moreover, we present a closed-loop music therapy system and introduce its implementation details. Finally, we discuss some challenges in AIGC-based music therapy with proposing further research direction, and we suggest the potential of this system to become a consumer-grade product for treating mental disorders.},

  pages={195-211},
  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize all aspects of business, particularly new-product development (NPD). Currently, our approach to NPD has remained largely unchanged for decades, yielding stubbornly poor results: only 30% of NP development projects become commercial successes. However, the AI revolution is set to alter this landscape significantly! Leading early adopter firms demonstrate that AI not only finds many applications in NPD but also offers substantial payoffs, such as 50% reductions in development times. This article provides an outline of the diverse and powerful applications of AI in NPD, offering numerous examples from leading companies. Examples include GE's use of digital models and twins to quickly test product designs in turbine development; BASFs use of AI to identify new molecules for use in customer formulations; and AI to generate new-product ideas, identify new-product opportunities, and even create new-product concepts. Our exploratory journey begins at the idea stage and traverses the entire new-product process to the postlaunch period. While AI might still resemble science fiction to many, that future is no longer fiction—it is here now. AI has arrived in full force! With an adoption window of about 13 years, the time is now to embrace AI in NPD in your business. AI will become a major milestone in NPD, perhaps the most important, within the decade.},

  abstract={Social Media Systems such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter (i.e., X) are exploding. These systems need proper governance so that the users are safe and post accurate information. This paper focuses on social media governance with an emphasis on Artificial Intelligence. First, we discuss various aspects of governance of such policies, procedures and risk and then address a key topic which is detecting fake news on social media. In order for the users to be safe using social media we have to ensure that the governance aspects also include fake news detection. Many of the fake news detection techniques utilize Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and more recently Generative AI (GenAI) techniques. Therefore, the AI systems that implement the various techniques have to be trustworthy. That means these systems have to be secure as well as ensure fairness, privacy and integrity. Therefore, the paper will also discuss AI Governance as an integral part of Social Media Governance. Finally, to support the various applications and frameworks, both data and the cloud are critical. Large amounts of data are stored and managed by the social media systems as well as used to train the AI models. Furthermore, we need massive amounts of computing power that can be provided by the cloud. Therefore, we will also discuss data and cloud governance that provides the infrastructure for social media and AI governance.},

Search for more avenues of investment in this field continues till date. It’s also evident that researchers and organizations have barely scratched the surface in terms of exploring and using AI (Artificial intelligence) as a technology. Theoretical forms of AI have not yet been implemented. This paper aims to provide some context around the various forms of AI currently used and can be explored in the near future. It’s important to be mindful that, with the use of any technology, even AI, there are challenges, regulations, and security risks that tag along. Firms need to pay close attention to the macro factors that could impact the adoption and AI in their respective businesses. This study aims to provide a brief overview of the aforementioned road blocks that could impact AI adoption, however, there are some solution strategies or approaches that could help firms along the way to overcome those road blocks. These strategies might take time to build and take effect but they will be beneficial in the long run and thus help with not only sustainable implementation, but also complete and successful adoption of AI as a technology enabler.},

  abstract={Proper artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) model implementation and training are highly reliant on quality input data. However, the high costs of clinical studies and increasing privacy concerns limit the availability of medical data to researchers. This work explores the potential of applying generative adversarial networks (GAN) for generating synthetic medical data based on publicly available real-world datasets. Synthetic data is generated based on real-world observations and used to train several contemporary ML and AI models. These models are subjected to comparison with models trained on real data. Both trained models are evaluated under identical conditions on real-world testing data. These well-known, high-quality datasets are explored in this study covering diabetes and heart disease. While models trained on synthetic data show a slight decrease in objective performance, they still demonstrate viably accurate outcomes. This suggests that the introduced approach presents a potential stepping stone towards improvising data availability for researchers while respecting patients’ best interests and patient privacy.},

  abstract={The rapid development of artificial intelligence has made an increase in the amount of generated content around the globe. Art is the most threatened field due to AI, potentially affecting the market value of an artist's creation. These generated images also affect artists who rely on their work for income as the accessibility of these models diminishes the demand for hiring real artists. As these generative models continue to evolve, it is becoming more difficult to differentiate between authentic art and generated ones. This paper addresses the need for a tool that can accurately distinguish between human-made and AI-generated artworks using a convolutional neural network (CNN) known as EfficientNetV2, ResNet50, and VGGNet. Our methodology involves using a dataset comprising images created by both human artists and AI algorithms.

  abstract={Generative adversarial network is a popular deep learning technique for solving artificial intelligence tasks, and it has been widely studied and applied for processing images, voices, texts and so on. Especially, generative adversarial network is adopted in the field of image processing, such as image style transfer, image restoration, image super-resolution and so on. Although generative adversarial networks show remarkable success in image generation, training process is usually unstable and trained models collapse where many of the generated images may contain the same color or texture pattern. In this paper, the network of generator and discriminator are modified, and the residual block is added to the generative adversarial network architecture to learn better image features. To reduce the loss of image feature during training and get more features to stabilize image generation, we use feature matching to minimize feature loss between the real and generated images for stable training. In the experiment, performance improvement can be obtained by adopting our proposed method, which is also better than some state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={Modern Chatbots represent a significant advancement in human-computer interaction by integrating emotional intelligence into their design. Unlike traditional chatbots that rely on predefined rules and keyword recognition, these advanced systems use affective computing and sentiment analysis to understand and respond to user’s emotional states. By using large LLMs, this innovation brings several key benefits. It enhances efficiency by providing immediate, relevant answers without users needing to search through multiple sources. The chatbot delivers precise information tailored to the emotional context of the interaction. Additionally, these chatbots offer greater convenience by consolidating information into a single query, streamlining the user experience and reducing the need to navigate through various platforms. They have improved so much yet are so much limited. An emotion sensitive chatbots should recognize and respond to emotional cues, fostering a deeper connection with users, encouraging regular interaction, creating a more interactive and personalized experience while also offering valuable insights into user behavior and preferences, enabling organizations to refine their marketing strategies and product development efforts. Overall, emotion-based chatbots should bridge the gap for human digital interactions.

In a case study of designing an animated series as content to accompany meals for people aged 25-30 years who like to watch movies while eating, the authors try to shorten the character design process using LeonardoAI. The authors try to understand the visual preferences of the target audience using a quantitative method, using a questionnaire filled with questions about the images generated by LeonardoAI. The questionnaire results became the basis for the character design ideas for the animated series ‘Genset Gang’ using keywords to develop the character's visuals. The authors found that using LeonardoAI can speed up the character design process because it can produce many images quickly, although its use has challenges. After all, LeonardoAI relies heavily on the character designer's ability to translate his ideas into prompt text and how the instruction code is successfully written.},

Expert assessments through questionnaire responses reveal that the average rating for the visual aesthetics of the images is 4 points, with a high score of 4.08 for style simulation effectiveness, and a presentation rating of 3.67 for Yunnan's cultural connotation. Expert reviews show approval for the migration results in the experiment, as the transferred pattern designs satisfy aesthetic preferences and meet the standards for simulating different styles. This work provides valuable insights for the preservation and inheritance of black copper patterns infused with silver, as well as for promoting their diversified applications.},

  abstract={The use of Artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the content creation to produce creative aspects like editing, audience analysis, creating ideas, writing copy, etc. The major aim is to streamline and automate the process of content creation and convert it into a more efficient and effective way. There is a lack of transparency in the AI content production process and hence it does not exactly mimic human activities, which includes fantasizing and picking up new abilities. AI content creation requires more creativity while investigating with a specific goal in mind. Although, AI faces many challenges since it constantly expands its base knowledge. One of the biggest ethical problems is the probability that AI content is used to deceive or influence people. Hence, to overcome these difficulties a machine learning-based Artificial Intelligent content creation framework is generated for content creation in Ad-supported TV. Here, an effective model Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) introduced to deliver enterprise data, customize descriptions, and adjust content based on consumer behaviors. This developed model produces material that is closely related to the preferences of the user. AI content creation increases efficiency and productivity by saving time and money. It also leads to the development of better content. Finally, the experimental analysis is performed to find the effectiveness of the developed deep learning-based AI content creation framework via various metrics.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is a task in artificial intelligence where an intelligent agent is required to answer questions about its environment. For example, to answer a question such as "Is the TV on or off?", the agent must navigate to the room with the TV and answer with either "On." or "Off." after recognizing the status. Unlike traditional question-answering systems that rely solely on text or static images, EQA involves agents that can move through a physical or simulated space, interact with the environment, and gather information to respond accurately. The agent must interpret both visual and linguistic inputs, navigate the environment, and complete tasks or locate objects based on the user’s questions. However, in the real world, the agent always faces unseen environments (i.e. different people’s houses), which makes the pre-trained model fail. Meanwhile, re-training in an unseen environment can cause high costs. Therefore, it is significant for the agent to learn continually by itself to cope with the challenges of unseen environments. In this work, we proposed a continual learning method based on generative adversarial imitation learning and self-supervision to support the agent when facing unseen environments. Besides, we designed a policy generator and policy quality discriminator to generate action policy sequences and evaluate the quality of the policy, respectively. Extensive experiments on the MP3D-EQA dataset demonstrate that our method reaches state-of-the-art performance.},

  year={2024},
  volume={17},
  number={},
  pages={2025-2036},
  abstract={This article presents a controlled case study focused on implementing and using generative artificial intelligence, specifically large language models (LLMs), in physiotherapy education to assist instructors with formulating effective technology-mediated feedback for students. It outlines how these advanced technologies have been integrated into an existing feedback-oriented platform to guide instructors in providing feedback inputs and establish a reference framework for future innovations in practical skills training for health professions education. Specifically, the proposed solution uses LLMs to automatically evaluate feedback inputs made by instructors based on predefined and literature-based quality criteria and generates actionable textual explanations for reformulation. In addition, if the instructor requires, the tool supports summary generation for large sets of text inputs to achieve better student reception and understanding. The case study describes how these features were integrated into the feedback-oriented platform, how their effectiveness was evaluated in a controlled setting with documented feedback inputs, and the results of its implementation with real users through cognitive walkthroughs. Initial results indicate that this innovative implementation holds great potential to enhance learning and performance in physiotherapy education and has the potential to expand to other health disciplines where the development of procedural skills is critical, offering a valuable tool to assess and improve feedback based on quality standards for effective feedback processes. The cognitive walkthroughs allowed us to determine participants' usability decisions in the face of these new features and to evaluate the perceived usefulness, how this would integrate into their workload, and their opinion regarding the potential for the future within this teaching strategy. This article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for practice and future research directions in this developing field.},

  abstract={Contribution: This study offers an analysis of cybersecurity for continuing advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, we synthesized the literature and highlighted the possible cybersecurity risks and ethical concerns associated with advancements in AI. Background: Recent advancements in AI have implicated various risks and ethical concerns regarding cybersecurity. Prior literature studies have highlighted a plethora of these issues. We have conducted a systematic review to analyze the issues presented in the prior literature. Analyzing the issues presented has allowed us to answer one research question. Research Question: Our study answered one research question: Given the continuous advancements in artificial intelligence, what are cybersecurity's potential risks and ethical concerns? Methodology: We utilized the IEEE Xplore database to answer the research question. After setting the search criteria to journal articles posted between 2019 and 2024, we found 67 articles relevant to our keywords. After screening, we finalized 16 articles to address our research question. The articles selected were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis. Articles were then categorized into three different themes: (1) social engineering, (2) misinformation and fake news, and (3) hacking. Findings: Our findings indicate that researchers have informed us about the malicious use of AI in cybersecurity by classifying attacks into three themes. These themes indicate the manner of attack. Furthermore, we find that the major risks and ethical concerns regarding the application of AI in cybersecurity relate to the preservation of privacy. As the field of artificial intelligence continues to grow, we see that it is imperative to continue monitoring the safety of this technology. For researchers to serve the public, future work should aim to translate technical terminology into more digestible phrases for those not knowledgeable in the field.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of Generative AI technology, the detection and governance of fake news has become a hot topic of concern in academia and society. The wide dissemination of fake news not only disrupts the public's information perception but also triggers social phenomena such as information epidemics, posing significant challenges to social stability, political environment and public health. Especially driven by social media, the speed and breadth of information dissemination have greatly intensified the spread of fake news. The research findings indicate that Generative AI mainly focuses on the optimization of natural language processing and deep learning technologies, providing new technical support for the detection of fake news. Meanwhile, the role of social media platforms and information dissemination pathways have become the focus of scholars' attention. However, issues such as the dissemination of cross-platform fake news, the practical application of generative AI, and the accuracy and robustness of algorithms remain the main challenges in current research. In this regard, this article suggests that future research should further optimize large-scale language models, promote innovation in multimodal fake news detection technology, and strengthen research on cross platform fake news dissemination mechanisms, in order to provide more accurate and effective technical support for fake news governance and alleviate its negative impact on society.},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disorder caused by insulin resistance and dysfunctional glucose regulation that affects millions of individuals worldwide. However, managing T2D is challenging because blood glucose levels fluctuate due to diet, exercise, and patients’ idiosyncrasies. Approaches such as real-time monitoring, predictive modeling, and personalized treatment have been among the major breakthroughs in the field. Still, their holistic integration for dynamic dosing and dietary optimization has remained largely unexplored. This research analyzes insights from recent research that reveal different methodologies such as machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and predictive models in improving diabetes management outcomes. Some studies showed up to 1.5% HbA1c reduction and time-in-range improvement by 20% to 25% due to artificial intelligence (AI) driven interventions. The accuracy of blood glucose prediction in these studies ranged from 85% to 95%, thus showing that these models can control blood sugar levels at any given moment. The preliminary results show that dynamic dosing models combined with dietary recommendations may achieve a 0.8% to 1.2% decrease in HbA1c and a 10% to 15% improvement in overall glycemic control. This study investigates the applications of Digital Twin (DT) technology, Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Generative AI (Gen AI) in diabetic control systems. The proposed model adopts these strategies to illustrate the possibility of connecting the existing research gaps and prepare for future developments on adaptive AI-powered framework for diabetes care.},

  abstract={This Innovative Practice Work-in-Progress paper presents a virtual, proactive, and collaborative learning paradigm that can engage learners with different backgrounds and enable effective retention and transfer of the multidisciplinary AI-cybersecurity knowledge. While progress has been made to better understand the trustworthiness and security of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, little has been done to translate this knowledge to education and training. There is a critical need to foster a qualified cybersecurity workforce that understands the usefulness, limitations, and best practices of AI technologies in the cybersecurity domain. To address this import issue, in our proposed learning paradigm, we leverage multidisciplinary expertise in cybersecurity, AI, and statistics to systematically investigate two cohesive research and education goals. First, we develop an immersive learning environment that motivates the students to explore AI/machine learning (ML) development in the context of real-world cybersecurity scenarios by constructing learning models with tangible objects. Second, we design a proactive education paradigm with the use of hackathon activities based on game-based learning, lifelong learning, and social constructivism. The proposed paradigm will benefit a wide range of learners, especially underrepresented students. It will also help the general public understand the security implications of AI. In this paper, we describe our proposed learning paradigm and present our current progress of this ongoing research work. In the current stage, we focus on the first research and education goal and have been leveraging cost-effective Minecraft platform to develop an immersive learning environment where the learners are able to investigate the insights of the emerging AI/ML concepts by constructing related learning modules via interacting with tangible AI/ML building blocks.},

  year={2023},

  abstract={Ensemble classifiers are constructed from various component classifiers by aggregating the results of the individual classifiers in some manner. While there are many ways to do this, one of the least computationally intensive is to use a voting ensemble, where the vote of each classifier is weighted by a number representing its performance. Choosing the appropriate weights is an involved process, that ranges from using trial and error to using sophisticated machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we proposed a novel technique that uses generative adversarial networks to customize the weights used for each individual input to the ensemble. Specifically, we propose to use conditional generative adversarial networks to generate the weights, with the input image acting as the label to the network and the appropriate weight being the output. We test the proposed system on an image classification task and show that the proposed method produces better results than using fixed weights by 2.43 percent.},

  volume={},

  pages={1079-1083},
  abstract={We propose a deblurring method that integrates a combination of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and encoder-decoder models. Our approach offers higher efficiency and reduced training complexity compared to generative deblurring models which utilizing GANs as the backbone network. In this approach, we employ the encoder as the feature extraction module, and then passes the features to the GANs for deblurring, followed by image reconstruction using the decoder as the last module. To ensure image fidelity, skip connections are introduced between the encoder and decoder. Meanwhile, we introduce a targeted training methodology designed to mitigate fluctuations in network parameters, thereby maximizing the efficacy of the model’s training velocity. We additionally conducted comparative evaluations based on the GoPro and Kohler datasets, contrasting our model against previously proposed algorithms to approve its exceptional performance in deblurring efficacy and efficiency.},

  abstract={A new algorithm framework is proposed, which combines the self-attention mechanism and the transformer model, to enhance the efficiency and quality of the creation of digital creative content. The system realizes the semantic understanding and generation tasks of multimodal data by designing a multi-layer Transformer architecture, and fully exploits the context modeling ability of the self-attention mechanism. To verify the performance of the algorithm, this paper simulates the model in image generation, text generation and multimodal content generation tasks. The test results show that the system has achieved significant improvements in the coherence, diversity and innovation of the generated content. Experiments on a public dataset show that the BLEU score of the generated text content is 12.3% higher than that of the traditional method, the FID index of image generation is reduced by 15.7%, and the semantic consistency score of multimodal generation reaches 92.4%. These results prove the superiority and practicality of the proposed algorithm. This research not only provides a new way to generate digital creative content, but also provides a theoretical basis for the further integration of AI and creative industry.},

  abstract={Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging and quickly advancing field that combines the subsymbolic strengths of (deep) neural networks and the explicit, symbolic knowledge contained in knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance explainability and safety in AI systems. This approach addresses a key criticism of current generation systems, namely, their inability to generate human-understandable explanations for their outcomes and ensure safe behaviors, especially in scenarios with unknown unknowns (e.g., cybersecurity, privacy). The integration of neural networks, which excel at exploring complex data spaces, and symbolic KGs, which represent domain knowledge, allows AI systems to reason, learn, and generalize in a manner understandable to experts. This article describes how applications in cybersecurity and privacy, two of the most demanding domains in terms of the need for AI to be explainable while being highly accurate in complex environments, can benefit from neurosymbolic AI.},
