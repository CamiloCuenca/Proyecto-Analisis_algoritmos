  number={},
  pages={243-247},
  abstract={This research paper introduces a novel pipeline for image generation and enhancement, integrating advanced techniques from stable diffusion and deep neural network (DNN) super-resolution. The pipeline consists of three key components: Stable Diffusion v1.5, Stable Diffusion XL Refiner 1.0, and ESPCN (Enhanced Sub-Pixel Convolutional Network). Stable Diffusion v1.5 serves as the foundation for text-to-image generation, utilizing the innovative approaches of Self Attention Guidance (SAG) and Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). CFG directs the model's output fidelity towards the provided prompt, ensuring faithful image generation. Meanwhile, SAG leverages internal self-attention maps to iteratively refine image details, resulting in higher-quality outputs. The Stable Diffusion XL Refiner 1.0 component enhances previously generated images, affording control over the influence of prior images on refinement. By adjusting this influence, users can tailor the refinement process to either maintain consistency with the previous image or explore new visual possibilities. ESPCN, a Deep Neural Network Upscaler embedded within OpenCV, completes the pipeline by upscaling the generated image by a factor of two. Its compact design enables real-time operations, making it suitable for various applications. Through comprehensive experimentation and evaluation, this pipeline demonstrates remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality images from textual prompts and refining them to achieve desired visual outcomes. The integration of stable diffusion techniques with DNN super-resolution presents a promising avenue for advancing image generation and enhancement methodologies.},

  abstract={Recognition of real-world images plays important role in a rapidly expanding range of applications. In this work we examined characteristics of distributions of classes of aerial images of terrain obtained in real time aerial photography from the perspective of detection and rectification of outliers in the generative latent distributions of image classes. Neural network models of generative self-learning with the architecture of convolutional autoencoder were used for compression of image data and extraction of informative features via selection of most informative principal components. Influence of outliers was examined with respect to distributions of image classes in the informative low-dimensional latent representations and classification performance of models trained in such representations. It was found that removal of outliers results in significantly more compact latent distributions of characteristic types of images, with a positive impact on classification performance. The results can be used in developing methods of learning based on unsupervised generative structure in informative representations in applications and problems with a deficit of training data.},

  abstract={Super-Resolution (SR) refers to the reconstruction of high-resolution image from low-resolution image, which has important application value in object detection, medical imaging, satellite remote sensing and other fields. In recent years, with the rapid development of deep learning, the image super-resolution reconstruction method based on deep learning has made remarkable progress. In this paper, R-SRGAN (Residual Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks) is used to build the model and realize image super-resolution. By adding residual blocks between adjacent convolutional layers of the GAN generator, more detailed information is retained. At the same time, the Wassertein distance is used as a loss function to enhance the training effect and achieve image super-resolution.},

  abstract={This study explores a new approach to the application of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) in the field of game scene generation, with a particular focus on the Score-Based Generative Model. The model is utilised in the Minecraft game scene construction task, and its performance is assessed through comparative experiments and Bits Per Dimension (BPD) values. We first introduce the background and challenges of game scene generation, followed by an in-depth discussion of the advantages of the Score-Based Generative Model, including its continuity, noise introduction method, training stability, and scene realism. The experimental results demonstrate the gradual improvement of the model's performance in image restoration as the number of training rounds and the maximum noise parameter are adjusted. In particular, optimising the maximum noise parameter enhances the model when adapting to the complexity of the real scene by balancing the noise introduction, and improves the accuracy and stability of image restoration. We found that, when applying the pre-trained model performed on the CIFAR-10 dataset to the Minecraft dataset, the domain mis-match resulted in high BPD values, revealing the importance of domain-specific training. Overall, this study provides game developers with a high-quality and highly realistic solution for scene generation, which provides a solid foundation for game experience enhancement and game development innovation. Future work can further explore strategies such as domain adaptation to improve the applicability of the model in specific domains for game scene generation tasks.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Navigating large PDF documents manually or using basic keyword-based tools can be tedious, especially in fields like academic research, legal analysis, and healthcare, where accurate and timely information retrieval is crucial. To address this, a system integrates Generative AI (GenAI) with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, allowing users to interact with PDF content through natural language queries, making the search process faster and more intuitive. For example, querying a legal document for payment terms provides clear answers, helping users navigate complex documents. Traditional keyword-based methods lack contextual understanding, a limitation overcome by the system, which transforms document content into vector embeddings using models like BERT or GPT. These embeddings capture semantic details for precise retrieval from a vector database. Researchers can quickly extract relevant sections of academic papers without manually scanning the entire document. The system processes content into vector embeddings, stores them in a vector database, and generates coherent responses using a large language model when a user submits a query. This approach simplifies tasks like analyzing healthcare reports. Additionally, the system features session management, ensuring continuity across multiple queries. This allows users, such as legal professionals, to maintain context when reviewing a contract, enabling coherent responses to various queries about clauses or penalties. Future enhancements could include supporting data formats like charts, tables, or images, further expanding the system’s versatility. By addressing inefficiencies in traditional navigation and introducing advanced features like session continuity, this system revolutionizes document workflows in research, legal analysis, and healthcare. It sets a new standard for conversational AI tools, transforming how users interact with PDF documents.},

  abstract={Since objects in natural scenarios possess various scales and aspect ratios, learning the rich edge information is very critical for vision-based tasks. Conventional generative adversarial networks (GANs) based methods for edge detection don't perform so well due to model collapse. In order to capture rich edge information and avoid model collapse as much as possible, we consider the learning of GANs as an evolutionary optimization and propose a novel method termed as differential-evolution-based generative adversarial networks (DEGAN) for richer edge detection. In particular, built upon GANs structure, we introduce an improved differential evolutionary algorithm to refine the input of generator, with fitness function evaluated by the discriminator. Experimental results on the well-known BSDS500 and NYUD benchmarks indicate our proposed DEGAN can achieve state-of-the-art performance while retaining a fast speed and validate its simplicity, effectiveness, and efficiency. The high quality of our results on edge detection with proposed DEGAN may promise to make other vision-based tasks work better.},

  abstract={Trajectory data generated in location-based service environments contain highly sensitive personal information, making them a prime target for privacy attacks. At the same time, however, valuable statistical information can be obtained from such private data. Optimizing this tradeoff between utility and privacy presents a challenge. This study introduces a novel method for partially anonymizing sensitive areas using a conditional generative adversarial network. The proposed method enables the learning of complex spatial, temporal, and categorical features of the selected sensitive area through the utilization of our condition label structure and loss function. In this study, we evaluate and analyze the contents by considering the spatial-temporal characteristics and dividing them into spatial usability and temporal usability. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms related models that employ generative adversarial networks. We achieved high scores in a majority of spatial evaluation items while also discussing the aspects that obtained relatively low scores.},

  abstract={Teaching materials are crucial for improving the efficiency of teaching and learning. However, traditional tools for creating teaching materials are mutually independent and lack sufficient intelligence, resulting in low efficiency and limited adaptability. This paper presents a generative artificial intelligence(GAI)-based teaching material system(TMGS) to create materials for both teachers and students in a human-in-the-loop model. The TMGS comprises three modules: pre-class material generation, in-class material generation, and post-class material generation. The pre-class module assists teachers in creating well-structured teaching plans, while the in-class module provides valuable resources for both teachers and students during lessons. The post-class module focuses on delivering personalized assignments to students. Throughout all stages, teachers play a critical role in reviewing the generated materials. To evaluate the system’s performance, we conducted materials generation on the topic of “inverse proportion” in primary school mathematics by utilizing large language models like GPT-4. The experiments demonstrate that the system exhibits excellent comprehensiveness, efficiency, and adaptability.},

  abstract={Summary <p>The mixing of superior deep learning strategies has profoundly impacted the sector of disease detection, promising sizable advancements in diagnostic accuracy and performance. This chapter explores the utilization of multiscale convolutional layers, interest mechanisms, switch learning, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and self&#x2010;supervised learning in the healthcare domain. These techniques collectively beautify the capability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to discover and diagnose diseases from medical images with extraordinary precision. Multiscale convolutional layers allow the models to capture features at numerous scales, improving the sensitivity and specificity of disease detection, mainly in situations like most cancers. Attention mechanisms similarly refine this process by allowing models to focus on the most applicable components of a medical image, mirroring the meticulous examination by human healthcare professionals.</p> <p>Transfer learning, leveraging pretrained models, extensively reduces the reliance on large, categorized datasets, thereby expediting the development process and enhancing version accuracy. This approach has shown outstanding success throughout distinctive imaging modalities, from X&#x2010;rays to CT scans, improving the adaptability and robustness of diagnostic models. GANs contribute via producing artificial records to augment training datasets, addressing the challenge of limited data availability and enhancing model performance, specifically in rare disease scenarios. Self&#x2010;supervised learning, which trains models on unlabeled records via proxy duties, has demonstrated comparable performance to fully supervised models while requiring fewer categorized samples, therefore lowering the need for costly and time&#x2010;consuming data annotation.</p> <p>Innovations in those regions are no longer the handiest improvements the technical overall performance of disease detection models but additionally open new avenues for their application. Future studies instructions consist of the exploration of multi&#x2010;modal learning, which mixes data from various assets including genomic information and digital health data, imparting a more complete diagnostic perspective. The implementation of federated learning guarantees data privacy while enhancing version training via decentralized records assets. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques enhance version interpretability, fostering extra consideration and popularity amongst healthcare professionals. Moreover, the integration of AI with wearable devices for continuous fitness tracking and the improvement of real&#x2010;time adaptive learning models hold tremendous promise for revolutionizing patient care and disease control.</p> <p>This comprehensive method for leveraging superior deep learning methodologies in disease identification underscores the transformative potential of AI in healthcare. With the aid of addressing modern&#x2010;day demanding situations and exploring progressive answers, we can pave the way for greater accurate, efficient, and personalized diagnostic systems, in the end enhancing patient results and advancing the same old of care in medical exercise.</p>},

  pages={111-114},
  abstract={Singing voice synthesis (SVS) is a task using the computer to generate songs with lyrics. So far, researchers are focusing on tunning the pre-recorded sound pieces according to rigid rules. For example, in Vocaloid, one of the commercial SVS systems, there are 8 principal parameters modifiable by song creators. The system uses these parameters to synthesize sound pieces pre-recorded from professional voice actors. We notice a common difference between computer-generated songs and real singers' songs. This difference can be addressed to help the generated ones become more like the real-singer ones. In this paper, we propose SinGlow, as a solution to minimise this difference. SinGlow is one of the Normalizing Flow that directly uses the calculated Negative Log-Likelihood value to optimize the trainable parameters. This feature gives SinGlow the ability to perfectly encode inputs into feature vectors, which allows us to manipulate the feature space to minimize the difference we discussed before. To our best knowledge, we are the first to propose an application of Normalizing Flow in SVS fields. In our experiments, SinGlow shows the ability to make the input virtual-singer songs more human-like. The code of the SinGlow model is available at https://github.com/discover304/singlow.},

  abstract={Inverse mapping of the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) which projects data to latent space have been recently introduced, and it is shown that the inverse mapping models trained by the bidirectional adversarial learning can enable novel and practical operations including interpolation between real data. However, existing techniques still do not ensure the consistent mapping between the data and their latent representation so that the models are hardly converged throughout training steps. Our discussion begins with empirical investigations on the inconsistency issue of the prior techniques, and we further propose a novel adversarial learning method, Pseudo Conditional Bidirectional GAN (PC-BiGAN), for training the inverse mapping of GANs with a high degree of consistency and similarity-awareness. Our models are specifically guided by the pseudo conditions defined by the proximity relationship among data in unsupervised learned feature space. We demonstrate that our novel bidirectional adversarial learning frameworks improve the performance in sample reconstruction, generation, and interpolation.},

  abstract={The intersection of technological advancement and environmental sustainability presents a challenge in contemporary society. This study explores this intersection within the framework of the MOZART project, a research initiative funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2021 program. At its core, the MOZART project seeks to advance Safe and Sustainable by Design (SSbD) strategies, with a specific focus on replacing environmentally harmful Hard Chromium coatings. These coatings, while offering exceptional performance, pose significant environmental risks due to the carcinogenic nature of Chromium Trioxide, a byproduct of their production process. The proposed solution centers on nickel matrix nano-composite coatings. However, the traditional use of boric acid in the process to obtain them, contradicts sustainability principles, necessitating the exploration of sustainable alternative acids with similar performance. Using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), a specialized generative machine learning model, this study investigates potential boric acid substitutes. A comparative analysis of molecular representations is conducted to assess their suitability as inputs for the CVAE. Subsequently, an optimization process employing Genetic Algorithms is undertaken to identify regions within the CVAE’s latent space where sustainable molecules similar to boric acid are located.},

  abstract={The convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Computer Vision (CV), Computer Graphics (CG), and Extended Reality (XR) is driving innovation in immersive environments. A key challenge in these environments is the creation of personalized 3D assets, traditionally achieved through manual modeling, a time-consuming process that often fails to meet individual user needs. More recently, Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a promising solution for automated, context-aware content generation. In this paper, we present MineVRA (Multimodal generative artificial iNtelligence for contExt-aware Virtual Reality Assets), a novel Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) XR framework that integrates GenAI to facilitate coherent and adaptive 3D content generation in immersive scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we conducted a comparative user study analyzing the performance and user satisfaction of GenAI-generated 3D objects compared to those generated by Sketchfab in different immersive contexts. The results suggest that GenAI can significantly complement traditional 3D asset libraries, with valuable design implications for the development of human-centered XR environments.},

  abstract={Engineering structures and infrastructure continue to be used despite approaching or having reached their design lifetime. While contact-based measurement techniques are challenging to implement at a large scale and provide information at discrete locations only, noncontact methods are more user-friendly and offer accurate, robust, and continuous spatial information to quantify the structural conditions of the targeted systems. Advancements in optical sensors and image-processing algorithms increased the applicability of image-based noncontact techniques, such as photogrammetry, infrared thermography, and laser imaging for structural health monitoring (SHM). In addition, with the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, the assessment process is expedited and made more efficient. This article summarizes the efforts made in the last five years to leverage AI-aided noncontact sensing techniques for applications in SHM with an emphasis on image-based methods. Future directions to advance AI-aided image-based sensing techniques for SHM of engineering structures are also discussed.},

  abstract={This study proposes a novel approach for the classification of date fruits using image processing, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and explainable artificial intelligence (AI). A unique, manually curated dataset was assembled for this research, including a diverse range of date fruit types. Rigorous image pre-processing techniques, including grayscale conversion, normalization, augmentation, and resizing, were applied to prepare the dataset for effective model training. Various renowned transfer learning models– VGG16, VGG19, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetV2L, and ResNet50 –were evaluated for their performance on this dataset, and assessed based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The ResNet50 model demonstrated superior results with an accuracy of 94%. Importantly, the study incorporated Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), an explainable AI technique, providing a visually interpretable rationale for the model’s decisions by highlighting significant image regions contributing to classification. To the best of our knowledge, this implementation of Grad-CAM to address this research challenge is pioneering, offering significant insights for future research in agricultural produce classification.},

  abstract={Facial expression representation is often entangled with other facial attributes unrelated to expression. Therefore, the traditional convolutional neural network is difficult to identify different expressions. In order to solve the problem of face information entanglement, a new end-to-end expression disentanglement learning generation GAN network (DLGAN) is proposed in this paper. We adopt a novel Gan structure, which includes encoder, decoder and discriminator network to learn the expression representation separated from other facial attributes in the process of image reconstruction. We use the feature vector learned by Gan instead of the original image as the input of classification convolution neural network to recognize facial expressions. In addition, this paper also introduces the self attention module to improve the learning ability of DLgan. The experimental results show that our proposed method is comparable with the most advanced methods.},

  abstract={Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a lineage of Betacoronavirus, is the causative agent of COVID-19, which has caused millions of deaths and crippled economies around the world. Early detection and treatment of COVID-19 cases are crucial for containment and reduction in disease transmission. During an emergency such as a pandemic like COVID-19, when there is a lack of available treatment against a new disease, drug repurposing or repositioning can be an effective strategy to control the disease. Drug repositioning is cost-effective, minimizes failure in clinical trials, and obtains relatively speedy approval from regulatory authorities. Artificial intelligence (AI)-mediated drug repositioning treatment of COVID- 19 patients can speed up the management and medical care for the patients. AI, which includes cognitive computing, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, and machine learning, can identify potential antiviral drugs for treating a disease. The time frame for extracting essential facts, statistics, and evaluation of the existing preapproved and approved drugs using molecular descriptors can be reduced by AI technology. Based on experimental data, different supervised machine learning and deep learning algorithms are implemented as a part of AI strategies to identify the repurposable drug effectively. Screening of presently available drugs and the existing library of natural compounds or novel drug candidates for the treatments against COVID-19 can be based on protein-ligand or protein-peptide interactions, which are facilitated through machine learning and deep learning. Such screening reduces the frequency of failures that might occur in clinical trials. This chapter focuses on repurposing existing drugs using AI strategies, particularly in the context of SARS-CoV-2.},

  abstract={The next generation of cellular technology, 6G, is being developed to enable a wide range of new applications and services for the Internet of Things (IoT). One of 6G’s main advantages for IoT applications is its ability to support much higher data rates and bandwidth as well as to support ultralow latency. However, with this increased connectivity will come to an increased risk of cyber threats, as attackers will be able to exploit the large network of connected devices. Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to detect and prevent cyber attacks by continuously learning and adapting to new threats and vulnerabilities. In this paper, we discuss the use of generative AI for cyber threat-hunting (CTH) in 6G-enabled IoT networks. Then, we propose a new generative adversarial network (GAN) and Transformer-based model for CTH in 6Genabled IoT Networks. The experimental analysis results with a new cyber security dataset demonstrate that the Transformer-based security model for CTH can detect IoT attacks with a high overall accuracy of 95%. We examine the challenges and opportunities and conclude by highlighting the potential of generative AI in enhancing the security of 6G-enabled IoT networks and call for further research to be conducted in this area.},

  year={2024},
  volume={34},
  number={7},
  pages={6181-6193},
  abstract={The goal of image rescaling is to embed the information from high-resolution images into low-resolution images and then reconstruct the high-resolution images in reverse. Existing methods either focus on small scaling factors or do not generalize well to natural images with diverse content in extreme settings, i.e., using extreme scaling factors (e.g.,  $16\times $  and  $32\times $ ). When performing extreme rescaling, previous methods often fail to produce plausible high-quality results due to insufficient cues in low-resolution images. In this work, we propose an extreme natural image rescaling framework that exploits the rich generative prior integrated into the GAN model trained on large-scale natural images to reduce the ambiguity of extreme upscaling. Considering the invertible bijective transformation between quantized features and low-resolution image, we develop an invertible feature recovery module that generates semantically sound low-resolution image while maximizing the preservation of useful features for the subsequent upscaling. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale refinement module that explicitly introduces the supervised ground truth information to mitigate unpleasant artifacts and distortions. Extensive experiments show that the proposed rescaling framework formulated by the above components achieves significantly better visual performance than state-of-the-art methods.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={India has a vast tuberculosis (TB) burden that requires rapidly identifying pathogens. This is critical to outbreak detection and sentinel surveillance; however, most diagnoses are made in laboratory settings. Artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision advancements offer unprecedented opportunities to facilitate detection and reduce response time in field settings. This research investigates the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in Tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics, addressing the urgent need for innovative strategies in early discernment and precise diagnosis of this prevalent infectious disease. GANs, known for their success in medical image analysis, hold great promise for changing tuberculosis screening and diagnosis methods. Researchers want to improve the accuracy and efficiency of TB detection by using GAN-based approaches to generate synthetic TB-related medical images and identify subtle abnormalities associated with the disease. By integrating GAN-generated insights with clinical data, predictive analytics models can be developed to facilitate early TB detection and predict disease progression, empowering healthcare practitioners to make informed decisions and potentially improving patient outcomes. Additionally, GAN-powered predictive analytics have the potential to transform TB screening programs, particularly in resource-constrained settings, by offering cost-effective and scalable solutions that extend the reach of TB screening efforts, facilitating early detection and intervention to mitigate the impact of the disease. Furthermore, predictive analytics extends its role beyond detection to encompass personalized medicine approaches in TB management, enabling tailored treatment strategies that optimize alternative interventions, enhance treatment efficacy, and minimize adverse effects, thereby reducing the burden of TB on healthcare systems.},

  abstract={This work explores the design, implementation, and usage of generative agents towards simulating human behaviour. Through simulating (mis)information spread, we investigate the emergent social behaviours they produce.Generative agents demonstrate robustness to (mis)information spread, showing realistic conversational patterns. However, this robustness limits agents’ abilities to realistically simulate humanlike information dissemination. Generative agents also exhibit novel and realistic emergent social behaviours, such as deception, confrontation, and internalized regret. Using deception, agents avoid certain conversations. Through confrontation, an agent can verify information or even apologize for their actions. Lastly, internalized regret displays direct evidence that agents can internalize their experiences and act on them in a human-like way, such as through expressing remorse for their actions.We also identify significant technical dynamics and other phenomena. Generative agents are vulnerable to produce unrealistic hallucinations, but can also produce confabulations which fill in logical gaps and discontinuities to improve realism. We also identify the novel dynamics of "contextual eavesdropping" and "behavioural poisoning". Via contextual eavesdropping and behavioural poisoning, agent behaviour is altered through information leakage and sensitivity to certain statements, respectively.},

  pages={2543-2548},
  abstract={This paper presents ChatLoS-DTA, a custom Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model specifically developed for data analysis on the Domestic Traffic Ads (DTA) Legacy of Slavery dataset. The DTA dataset consists of numerous historical newspaper advertisements from 1824 to 1864 for buying and selling enslaved individuals across Maryland. This dataset, digitized and curated by the Maryland archives, offers valuable insights into patterns within the domestic slave trade. However, certain accessibility challenges exist for non-technical users, including the descendants of enslaved individuals or cultural researchers. ChatLoS-DTA, built on OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4 and Python libraries, was designed to allow such users to query the dataset using natural language without requiring any technical expertise. This paper discusses ChatLoS-DTA’s architecture, ethical framework, performance, and limitations, highlighting the model’s potential as a template for applying generative AI in cultural and historical research. Future work includes refining the tool’s accuracy to broaden dataset compatibility and further enhance ethical safeguards.},

  abstract={This paper presents a novel method for enhancing active learning and outcomes in electronic engineering by combining Generative AI for Game-Based Learning (GBL), and transdisciplinary tutoring in Moodle LMS. The approach bridges Analog Electronics (3rd semester) and Digital Design with Microcontrollers (6th semester, embedded systems) engineering courses, fostering collaboration through game-based projects focused on real-world analog-digital integration. Generative AI supports this by generating adaptable game scenarios, problems, and feedback, tailored to each student's learning progress. By incorporating popular game mechanics like Monopoly (for technological evolution), Trivial Pursuit (for component knowledge), and Settlers of Catan (for system design), the approach engages students in key topics like diodetransistor circuits, microcontroller programming, and analogdigital system design. Games are supervised in Moodle using workshop and other activities for peer review, allowing students to submit solutions, review peers' work, and track progress through quizzes, forums, journals, and peer feedback. Analog Electronics students learn Arduino microcontroller applications for lab instrumentation, while Digital Design students explore analog components' roles in embedded systems, deepening understanding of analog-digital interactions. A pilot case study shows increased engagement, collaboration, and practical application of concepts, highlighting the potential for AI, GBL, and Moodle-based transdisciplinary tutoring to personalize learning and deepen comprehension in complex engineering topics.

  abstract={Generative AI (GenAI) models have been rapidly advancing, with a wide range of applications including intelligent networks and mobile AI-generated content (AIGC) services. However, GenAI create opportunities for novel security challenges due to its wide range of services applications and potential capabilities. In this paper, we examine the challenges and opportunities of GenAI in the realm of the security of intelligent network services, acting as both a “spear” for potential attacks and a “shield” as an integral part of various defense mechanisms. First, we present a comprehensive overview of the GenAI landscape, highlighting its applications and the techniques underpinning these advancements, especially large language and diffusion models. Then, we investigate the dynamic interplay between GenAI’s spear and shield roles, highlighting two primary categories of potential GenAI-related attacks and their respective defense strategies within wireless networks. A case study illustrates the impact of GenAI defense strategies on energy consumption in an image request scenario under data poisoning attack. Our results show that by employing an AI-optimized diffusion defense mechanism, energy can be reduced by 8.7%, and retransmission count can be decreased from 32 images, without defense, to just 6 images, showcasing the effectiveness of GenAI in enhancing network security.},

  abstract={The network architecture for image generation needs help in dimensional transformation. In the traditional Optimal Transport GAN (OT-GAN) model, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are used for dimensional transformation. Although MLPs are widely used, they have significant drawbacks and could perform better in accuracy and image processing. We propose a method that improves the network architecture of OT-GAN to enhance its performance in image generation. First, we optimize the structure of the original OT-GAN model, expanding and replacing certain parts of the network architecture, and then replace all MLPs used for dimensional transformation with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). We verify OT-GAN using KANs on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results of the experiments indicate that the network with the KANs is more stable during training and performs better in terms of image quality and generation diversity than the traditional network using MLPs. These findings demonstrate the feasibility and potential of using KANs in image generation.},

  abstract={It is well known that the inverse design of terahertz (THz) multi-resonant graphene metasurfaces by using traditional deep neural networks (DNNs) has limited generalization ability. In this article, we propose improved Transformer and conditional generative adversarial neural networks (CGAN) for the inverse design of graphene metasurfaces based upon THz multi-resonant absorption spectra. The improved Transformer can obtain higher accuracy and generalization performance in the StoV (Spectrum to Vector) design compared to traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks, while the StoI (Spectrum to Image) design achieved through CGAN can provide more comprehensive information and higher accuracy than the StoV design obtained by MLP. Moreover, the improved CGAN can achieve the inverse design of graphene metasurface images directly from the desired multi-resonant absorption spectra. It is turned out that this work can finish facilitating the design process of artificial intelligence-generated metasurfaces (AIGM), and even provide a useful guide for developing complex THz metasurfaces based on 2D materials using generative neural networks.},

This paper presents a Artificial Intelligence-driven framework for accurate crop disease detection using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) and ResNet18. cGANs are used to generate high-quality synthetic images of diseased crops, which enrich datasets usually constrained by data scarcity. These enriched data are utilized in fine-tuning ResNet18. Notable classification accuracies are observed for both training, at 96.15%, and validation set, at 95.26%, despite having changed environmental conditions. Further integrating with the Gemini Application Program Interface, it is designed to deliver real-time and actionable disease-related information.

  abstract={Sketch-based person re-identification (Sketch re-ID) aims to match pedestrian figures in hand-drawn sketches with their corresponding RGB photos. This technique allows for person retrieval or tracking in surveillance systems when the target person’s RGB photo is not available. While previous research predominantly focused on bridging the modality gap between sketches and RGB photos, the influence of the inherent subjectivity in hand-drawn sketches on re-ID performance remains under-explored. This subjectivity, originating from the artist’s unique style, perceptions, and interpretations, introduces inaccuracies in depicting pedestrian appearances, thereby posing additional challenges such as feature distortion and stylistic variation. This paper introduces a Contrastive-Generative-Contrastive (CGC) framework for subjective style-insensitive re-ID. The framework employs a generative model optimized through self-supervision by contrasting positive and negative pairs of pedestrian sketches and RGB photos. In this manner, it simulates an additional artist specializing in transforming original sketches from various subjective styles into uniform ones. Besides, a simple yet effective weighted contrastive learning loss is proposed to further enhance the model’s focus on pedestrian ID-relevant features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the influence of subjectivity in feature extraction, achieving new state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.},

  abstract={Image dehazing is used to recuperate clear images from hazed or blurred photographs. Image dehazing should be rapid and simple to understand in order to be accessible. It may be very important for better visibility in inner extremities, such as fire risks, and be used in security and surveillance cameras as well as self-governing vehicles. A basic relic for image beautifying, it has made significant strides in recent years to recover the original image as accurately as possible without taking into account its efficacy and performance on low-end hardware. Following high-level computer vision tasks has proven difficult when it comes to single image dehazing because of the severe information deformation. The visibility of the region to be evaluated is severely reduced by atmospheric haze, endangering the accuracy of advanced-level activities. To reduce haze, different convolutional neural networks are used. Therefore, we will investigate one of the most accurate methods, which introduces a new deformable multi-head attention method for picture dehazing that is neutralized and spatially attentive for reconstruction in a restored image using fine textures. Furthermore, this enhances the deformable convolution with a spatially aware extractor with offset to concentrate on pertinent contextual information. By using edge boosting skip joins, edge features can be effectively transferred from shallow layers to deeper layers of the network.},

  abstract={Time series forecasting is one of the challenging problems for humankind. The traditional forecasting methods using mean regression models have severe shortcomings in reflecting real-world fluctuations. While new probabilistic methods rush to rescue, they fight with technical difficulties like quantile crossing or selecting a prior distribution. To meld the different strengths of these fields while avoiding their weaknesses, as well as, to push the boundary of the state-of-the-art, we introduce ForGAN - one step ahead probabilistic forecasting with generative adversarial networks. ForGAN utilizes the power of the conditional generative adversarial network to learn the data generating distribution and compute probabilistic forecasts from it. We argue how to evaluate ForGAN in opposition to regression methods. To investigate probabilistic forecasting of ForGAN, we create a new dataset and demonstrate our method abilities on it. This dataset will be made publicly available for comparison. Furthermore, we test ForGAN on two publicly available datasets, namely Mackey-Glass dataset and Internet traffic dataset (A5M), where the impressive performance of ForGAN demonstrate its high capability in forecasting future values.},

  year={2021},
  volume={2},
  number={4},
  pages={299-313},
  abstract={Recent research has shown that a small perturbation to an input may forcibly change the prediction of a machine learning (ML) model. Such variants are commonly referred to as adversarial examples. Early studies have focused mostly on ML models for image processing and expanded to other applications, including those for malware classification. In this article, we focus on the problem of finding adversarial examples against ML-based portable document format (PDF) malware classifiers. We deem that our problem is more challenging than those against ML models for image processing because of the highly complex data structure of PDF and of an additional constraint that the generated PDF should exhibit malicious behavior. To resolve our problem, we propose a variant of generative adversarial networks that generate evasive variant PDF malware (without any crash), which can be classified as benign by various existing classifiers yet maintaining the original malicious behavior. Our model exploits the target classifier as the second discriminator to rapidly generate an evasive variant PDF with our new feature selection process that includes unique features extracted from malicious PDF files. We evaluate our technique against three representative PDF malware classifiers (Hidost’13, Hidost’16, and PDFrate-v2) and further examine its effectiveness with AntiVirus engines from VirusTotal. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to analyze the performance against the commercial AntiVirus engines. Our model finds, with great speed, evasive variants for all selected seeds against state-of-the-art PDF malware classifiers and raises a serious security concern in the presence of adversaries. Impact statement—PDF has been one of the most popular media to conceal adversarial contents for many years. The reason being that adversaries can exploit the complex structure of PDF in their favor by hiding malicious content. In 2019, more than 73k PDF-based attacks were reported in one month, which accounts for 17% of newly detected threats. With increasing popularity, many ML-based techniques have been proposed for PDF malware classifiers. Such defense mechanisms include support vector machine and random forest classification models trained with a structural map of PDF (Hidost’13 and Hidost’16). Furthermore, ensemble training has been applied with metadata collected from PDF as the training data (PDFrate-v2). In recent studies, many researchers have attempted and succeeded in generating evasive PDF malware (adversarial examples) that bypass such defense techniques. However, the current method heavily relies on a random mutation algorithm resulting in repeated computation for a significant period of time. To resolve this, we propose a novel solution by employing a variant of generative adversarial networks, which is trained to identify intrinsic properties of PDF and to generate evasive PDF malware with the minimum perturbation to the original PDF. Our solution successfully generated evasive PDF malware with a maximum number of 12 manipulation operations and found effective against ML-based classifiers and AntiVirus engines provided by VirusTotal.},

  abstract={The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies enhances device smart decision-making, yet it also makes them more susceptible to cyber-attacks. AI-enabled Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) has been regarded as an effective way to mitigate such attacks. However, large-scale attacks data collection and labeling is prohibitively costly and time-consuming. Therefore, effective Few-Shot Learning based NIDS for IoT are crucial. Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks are widely used in generative few-shot learning but struggle with limited sample diversity and unstable training. Meanwhile, Deep Learning-based NIDS often lacks trustworthiness due to the “directed” problem. In response to these challenges, we propose a network traffic sample generation method that leverages the Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (CDDPM) to tackle the issues of samples. Then, we introduce an Intrusion Detection method named CNNBiGRU that combines Convolutional Neural Networks with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units based on the synthetic data generated by CDDPM. Furthermore, we apply the SHAP method to interpret the results to ensure model users’ trust. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on the two public datasets, which illustrate that our approach can successfully generates high-quality samples and improves the performance of NIDS.},

The objective is to develop an effective method for discerning genuine faces from manipulated ones. The proposed models utilize a dataset comprising both real and artificial images and employ neural networks-based deep learning algorithms. Social media platforms have become predominant sources of information, yet not all shared content is genuine; photographs can be altered, leading to deepfakes as a significant threat for spreading misinformation. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop models capable of detecting deepfakes.

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technology innovation holds promise for revolutionizing the mining industry. However, the sector’s traditionally conservative stance toward innovation has led to limited research. Thus, this manuscript aims to address this gap by exploring factors influencing the acceptance of GenAI technology innovation among mining industry employees from a developing country perspective. Based on literature reviews seven factors were identified to influence employees’ acceptance of GenAI technological innovation. These factors were examined in a data sample of 286 mining industry employees collected via an office-intercept survey and analyzed with Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) using the SmartPLS software. Through thorough data analysis, models have been constructed that exhibit robustness, evidenced by their strong validity, reliability, and excellent fit with the data. The findings reveal that attitude, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, compatibility, company size, industrial competitiveness, and top management support significantly influence the acceptance of GenAI technology innovation. Notably, attitude was identified as the most influential factor, significantly shaping the likelihood of adoption. Conversely, company size had a comparatively minor impact on acceptance, and the regulatory framework showed no significant effect on the adoption of GenAI technology innovation. These results have important theoretical and managerial implications. Theoretically, they provide a nuanced understanding of the key factors driving technology acceptance in the mining industry, challenging the traditional emphasis on regulatory frameworks. Managerially, they underscore the importance of focusing on factors when developing strategies to foster technological adoption.},

  abstract={The implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has the potential to unleash the capabilities of generative artificial intelligence (GAI). However, integrating GAI with IoT introduces a significant challenge in managing the limited resources of edge networks. In this article, we propose a resource optimization framework for GAI in IoT systems to address this issue, leveraging a heterogeneous computing framework. We focus on the system utility maximization problem, which jointly optimizes transmit power, heterogeneous computing allocation, CPU-cycle frequency, GPU-cycle frequency, and task scheduling under the latency constraint. The optimal CPU-cycle frequency, GPU-cycle frequency, and computing allocation are obtained by employing data parallelism analysis. In particular, we develop a hierarchical soft actor-critic with an intrinsic curiosity (HSAC-IC) algorithm to determine the task scheduling strategy. The HSAC-IC algorithm utilizes a hierarchical strategy structure and an intrinsic curiosity module (ICM) to improve learning efficiency and performance, particularly in environments characterized by sparse rewards, high-dimensional action spaces, and complex tasks. Our simulations benchmark the HSAC-IC algorithm against two existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms and three reference schemes. The results illustrate that our scheme significantly outperforms these alternatives, ensuring AIGC user service requirements, while minimizing service generation costs, and optimizing resource allocation by configuring the image quality strategy on edge servers.},

  abstract={Urban water systems are increasingly strained by the impacts of climate change, growing populations, and resource constraints, driving the need for more integrated and sustainable management solutions. Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are central to driving this transformation, leveraging their adaptability and significant impact on the industry. However, many SMEs lack access to comprehensive Information Systems (ISs) that combine data on government policies, industry trends, and water management initiatives, limiting their ability to implement sustainable practices. This study introduces Sustain WaterBot, a Chatbot powered by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), including Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Sustain WaterBot bridges this information gap by seamlessly integrating data from diverse sources such as news outlets, government publications, industry reports, scientific studies, and social media platforms into a unified IS. It enhances decision-making by providing timely and relevant insights into Sustainable Urban Water Initiatives (SUWIs) through an interactive Question Answering (QA) framework.

  pages={18253-18276},
  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the legal landscape, with software tools now impacting various aspects of legal work. The intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and law holds potential to transform how legal professionals, including lawyers and judges, operate, resolve disputes, and retrieve case information to formulate their decisions. To identify the current state of the applications of Transformers (also known as Large Language Models or LLMs) in the legal domain, we analysed the existing literature from 2017 to 2023 through a database search and snowballing method. From 61 selected publications, we identified key application categories such as legal document analysis, case prediction, and contract review, along with their main characteristics. We observed a discernible upsurge in the volume of scholarly publications, a diversification of tasks undertaken (e.g., legal research, contract analysis, and regulatory compliance), and an increased range of languages considered. There has been a notable enhancement in the methodological sophistication employed by researchers in practical applications. The performance of models grounded in the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architecture has consistently improved across various legal domains, including contract review, legal document summarization, and case outcome prediction. This paper makes several significant contributions to the field. Firstly, it identifies emerging trends in the application of LLMs within the legal domain, highlighting the growing interest and investment in this area. Secondly, it pinpoints methodological gaps in current research, suggesting areas where further development and refinement are needed. Lastly, it discusses the broader implications of these advancements for real-world legal tasks, offering insights into how LLM-based AI can enhance legal practice while addressing the associated challenges.},

  pages={2314-2326},
  abstract={Machine learning algorithms are driven by data. However, the quantity and quality of data in industries are limited due to multiple process constraints. Generating artificial data and performing a transfer learning task is a common solution to overcome these limitations. Recently, deep generative models have become one of the leading solutions for modeling a given source domain. The main hindrance to using those machine learning approaches is the lack of interpretability. Therefore, we present a novel variational autoencoder approach to generate time series data on a probabilistic latent feature representation and enhance interpretability within the generative model and the output trajectory. We sample selective and parameter values for certain continuous function candidates to assemble the synthetic time series. The sparse design of the generative model enables direct interpretability and matches an estimated posterior distribution of the detected components in the source domain. Through residual stacking, conditionality, and a mixture of prior distributions, we derive a stacked version of the evidence lower bound to learn our network. Tests on synthetic and real industrial datasets underline the performance and interpretability of our generative model. Depending on the model and function candidates, the user can define a trade-off between flexibility and interpretability. Overall, this work presents an innovative interpretable representation of the latent space and further developed evidence lower bound criterion driven by the designed architecture.},

Firstly, convolutional layers are added to the energy-based generative adversarial network (EBGAN) discriminator, thereby improving the feature extraction ability. Then, the classification loss is introduced into the loss function of EBGAN with the purpose of expanding the classification function of the discriminator. Finally, a planetary gearbox fault diagnosis model with sample generation capability is established to achieve the Nash equilibrium by the confrontation between the generator and the discriminator. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of fault diagnosis for planetary gearboxes even under imbalanced data.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a business model utilizing generative AI to address the labor shortage issue in the food service industry. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the bankruptcy rate in the food service industry has risen significantly. It mainly comes from the fact that business managers often fail to identify the key aspects customers prioritize when choosing a restaurant. The failure prevents the managers from attracting customers. The paper leverages the attention mechanism employed in large language models to identify the aspects that capture customer attention. The attention mechanism indicates which parts of the descriptions in popular recipes receive high self-attention scores. The experimental results reveal that the words receiving high self-attention scores vary with review types. It indicates that the self-attention mechanism can identify the elements humans focus on. The identified focal elements enable managers to amplify customer expectations. Cost reduction due to the automatic generation of messages emphasizing the elements makes them concentrate their efforts to satisfy customer expectations.},

  abstract={This visionary concept seeks to revolutionize the field of holographic video generation by leveragingthe immense potential of deep learning methodologies. The overarching goal is to create an innovative system that can seamlessly convert standard 2D videos into mesmerizing 3D hologram videos, which can be experienced through a simple and accessible pyramid structure. This novel approach aims to eliminate the complexities associated with conventional methods that require intricate camera setups and multifaceted perspective captures.The journey begins with the acquisition of a diverse dataset containing 2D videos, forming the bedrock for subsequent transformations. In the initial stages of data preprocessing, pivotal features are extracted from the input videos. Following this, a dynamic process of spatial and temporal transformations unfolds. This intricate choreography enlists the services of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which takes on the role of extracting spatial features from each individual frame. The CNN’s discerning gaze captures intricate visual nuances, bringing them to life within the holographic realm. Concurrently, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enters the stage, diligently capturing the subtle dance of temporal dependencies. This synergy augments the resulting holograms with an enhanced sense of depth perception, evoking a truly immersive experience.At the heart of this innovation lies a Fusion Neural Network, meticulously designed to harmonize the spatial and temporal features into a cohesive symphony. This orchestrated fusion births a feature representation that epitomizes the marriage of visual dimensions. This harmonious blend embarks ona transformative journey through the realm of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Within the GAN’s adversarial embrace, the feature representation unleashes a process of alchemical creation, conjuring forth holographic scenes that are breathtakingly lifelike and endlessly dynamic. This adversarial interplay, where a generator contends with a discriminator in a bid to refine the authenticity of the holographic fabric, is the crucible in which realism is forged. The grand culmination of this voyage is the emergence of a sophisticated system, poised to unravel the very fabric of conventional 2D videos. This astonishing transformation is executed with an exquisitely orchestrated pipeline of neural networks, wherein spatial, temporal, and generative forces synergize. The result is an enchanting array of holographic content, beckoning viewers to traverse the realms of imagination. The pyramid structure stands as both portal and pedestal, inviting audiences into an awe-inspiring experience that transcends the boundaries of traditional video playback. This audacious idea envisions a future where digital and physical realities intertwine, granting us a glimpse of what lies beyond the ordinary horizon of visual storytelling},

  abstract={Recently, several applications and specialized versions of ChatGPT have been developed to either create personalized exercise programs based on the fitness levels of practitioners or to provide post-exercise nutrition and recovery advice. However, existing specialized ChatGPTs are limited to specific tasks, and not well-finetuned. In this paper, we introduce a novel application of ChatGPT as a personalized assistant capable of correcting improper postures and analyzing body compositions. We trained ChatGPT to improve posture during exercises and daily activities, thereby enhancing its role as an assistant to prevent injuries and optimize training effectiveness. In addition, we explore ChatGPT's potential to understand body compositions and predict physical transformations, providing users with insights into the outcomes of their fitness and nutrition efforts. Our results indicate that the current ChatGPT model can identify and correct incorrect postures, but struggles to provide visual aids for the correction. It can also provide training schedules and nutrition plans based on requirements, but those plans tend to be general and lack customization. In terms of body composition, ChatGPT can analyze body fat on a broader scale, but with less sensitivity to smaller changes in body fat. The performance of ChatGPT can be further improved using more image datasets related to gym exercises, human postures, and body compositions.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={13486-13490},
  abstract={In recent years, semantic communication based on deep learning for source-channel joint encoding has garnered significant attention. It utilizes network models trained end-to-end to represent signals as embedding vectors and has demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional methods. However, due to the significant disparity between embedding vectors and human language, it can be challenging to succinctly capture abstract semantics such as scenes. In this paper, we introduce the Scene Graph-based Generative Semantic Communication (SG2SC) framework, built upon structured semantics and conditional generative models for image transmission. SG2SC aims to faithfully convey abstract semantics like scenes. It begins by detecting object categories, spatial attributes, and inter-category relationships in the image, representing scene semantics in a graph structure. Subsequently, it employs graph neural networks for scene graph encoding, decoding, and transmission, and finally utilizes a conditional diffusion model for semantic decoding. Benefiting from its concise graph structure semantics, SG2SC outperforms traditional method, semantic communication based on deep joint source-channel coding, and segmentation-based generative semantic communication in terms of noise resistance and encoding efficiency.},

  abstract={This study explores the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) field, focusing on its integration within the academic community of University North in Croatia. Specifically, it compares and quantifies the usage of advanced GAI tools such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot (Bing AI), Gemini (Google Bard), and others within the different user groups - including students (undergraduate, graduate, doctoral students), and teachers/researchers. The objective was to discern the varying usage patterns and acceptance levels among these groups, particularly in the context of research and work. Our findings indicate significant variations among those groups when considering both GAI users and non-users. However, once we narrow the analysis to GAI users only, the differences between different groups diminish. The study concluded that the most widely accepted and used GAI tool was ChatGPT, with undergraduate and doctoral students adopting it at the highest rates. Also, self-assessed GAI proficiency was higher for individuals who use those tools longer and for teachers/researchers and doctoral students who use them for more complex tasks. Doctoral students were more likely to pay for premium features.},

The study aims to explore an innovative type of artificial intelligence (AI) education technology to avoid students’ passive reliance on AI, which can erode their cognitive reflection and critical thinking skills. Inspired by the Peer Instruction methodology proposed by Prof. Eric Mazur, our solution transforms AI-generated direct answers into guided, step-by-step conversations that encourage active student participation and the development of critical thinking skills. Through engineering AI prompts, PeerSynergy simulates a peer with a comparable level of knowledge, fostering a more collaborative and fairer debate in the learning process. This approach ensures that students are not merely passive recipients of massive information but are actively engaged in a dynamic educational dialogue.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={This research study aimed to develop a diagnostic testing instrument to identify scientific misconceptions in the topic "Cells as the Basic Units of Living Organisms" among 7th-grade students. The research employed a research and development (R&D) methodology, combining instruments created by our LLM model and those created by humans. The study utilized a 10-item test measuring scientific misconceptions (5 items created by ChatGPT and 5 items created by humans), administered to 150 students in schools under the Secondary Educational Service Area Office in Chaiyaphum Province. The quality of the test was analyzed using the Rasch model and psychometric analysis with ACER ConQuest version 5.0 software. Results indicated that both AI-generated and human-created tests demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity; however, the human-created tests showed higher reliability (0.92 compared to 0.54) and higher EAP/PV and Cronbach's alpha values (0.84, 0.83 compared to 0.77, 0.77). Additionally, Wright Map analysis revealed that human-created items had a better distribution of difficulty levels covering the range of student abilities compared to ChatGPT-generated items. In the Turing test, experts were unable to accurately distinguish between AI-generated and human-created test items, with incorrect identification rates ranging from 40-80%. This suggests that AI-generated items closely resemble human-created items. The findings demonstrate the potential of artificial intelligence in developing educational assessment tools, particularly in creating diagnostic tests for scientific misconceptions. However, AI should not replace human experts and still requires expert supervision.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1367-1374},
  abstract={Communities of Practice (CoPs) groups share knowledge and expertise across disciplinary collectives and industrial sectors. This theoretical construct assumes learning occurs in and across societal contexts where individuals mutually engage in collective, symbolically shared repertoires. Of late, CoPs have been explored regarding the use of technology platforms to enhance learning and to extend symbolically collective learning activities. However, the extensive and recent saturation of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) calls for inquiry into how CoPs understand and adopt this ubiquitous technology discussion relative to shared repertoires. This is especially true given the lack of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) research into GenAI adoption at scale. The present study seeks to uncover how the prominent CoPs of Finance, Art, and Software Development understand GenAI as they discuss their technology adoption practices in online forums. Specifically, more than 2.1 million words of community discussion were examined lexically to reveal the manner by which varied CoPs generate shared repertoires for their community members. Findings indicate that types of practice disciplines relate to the lexical dialectics of Practice/Technology, People/Replacements, and Authenticity/Inauthenticity, as well as insightful discourses regarding what counts as work and adoption. A first for HCI, CoPs, and GenAI research, this study provides additional suggestions for future CoPs symbolically shared repertoires relative to new technologies, as well as how GenAI may be implicated in the adoption, work, and learning-based praxes of heterogeneous disciplinary communities. “Where the artificiality of all that’s being created, the lack of that ‘spark’ that makes an image, a design, even the concept for a product will become so sterile, so overly tasteless that a new culture of ‘human generated content and products’ will become, first a contra-culture, and then a possible rebirth of what really makes our creation unique: That the things we make as humans are our own and nurture us as a species.” “It does not replace programmers, c’mon. It will make getting a job for those without prior experience much harder tho’. But generally speaking, it’s just a tool.”},

  year={2022},
  volume={24},
  number={},
  pages={1787-1799},
  abstract={Character glyph synthesis is still an open challenging problem, which involves two related aspects, i.e., font style transfer and content consistency. In this paper, we propose a novel model named FontGAN, which integrates the character structure stylization, de-stylization and texture transfer into a unified framework. Specifically, we decouple character images into style representation and content representation, which offers fine-grained control of these two types of variables, thus improving the quality of the generated results. To effectively capture the style information, a style consistency module (SCM) is introduced. Technically, SCM exploits category-guided Kullback-Leibler divergence to explicitly model the style representation into different prior distributions. In this way, our model is capable of implementing transformations between multiple domains in one framework. In addition, we propose content prior module (CPM) to provide content prior for the model to guide the content encoding process and alleviates the problem of stroke deficiency during structure de-stylization. Benefiting from the idea of decoupling and regrouping, our FontGAN suffices to achieve many-to-many translation tasks for glyph structure. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FontGAN achieves the state-of-the-art performance in character glyph synthesis.},

  abstract={End-to-end single-stage text-to-speech models have garnered significant attention in recent research, surpassing the performance of conventional two-stage pipeline systems. While prior single-stage models have made substantial advancements, there remains room for improvement in addressing intermittent issues related to unnaturalness and prosody diversity. Unlike previous works, we propose a novel single-stage TTS framework to tackle these problems via hierarchical denoising diffusion generative adversarial networks (GAN) modeling, which parameterizes the denoising model by directly predicting latent variables to improve the naturalness and diversity of the generated speech. Specifically, a conditional GAN is adopted as a non-Gaussian multimodal function to model the denoising distribution, which construct the duration predictor and speech decoder respectively. As such, it allows the TTS model learn the more natural one-to-many relationship in which a text input can be spoken in multiple ways with different pitches and rhythms. In addition, We show that DETS can generate high-fidelity speech waveform with only 1 denoising step. Extensive experimental results on the LJSpeech benchmark dataset demonstrate the favourable performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract={This paper presents our contribution to the Financial Document Causality Detection (FinCausal) task, a component of the FNP-2023 workshop. The FinCausal challenge centers on the extraction of cause-and-effect relationships from financial texts written in both English and Spanish. Recent advancements in Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) have instigated investigations into their reasoning abilities, propelling our exploration of LLMs’ potential for causal reasoning within the financial domain. This study also ventures into the domain of non-English languages, aiming to uncover the capacity of LLMs on this front as well. Our investigation revealed that LLMs exhibit a remarkable ability to identify causal relationships, particularly when provided with few task-specific relevant examples. Additionally, our research demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in processing non-English languages when given the same English prompts along with language comprehension instructions. We conducted a comparative analysis between OpenAI GPT3.5 and 4, concluding that GPT-4 model is better-suited for this purpose. Our study unveils that LLMs yield semantically similar cause and effects. This discovery highlights LLMs don’t rely solely on content for the predictions and so the necessity of adopting an evaluation approach for this task, one that emphasizes also on semantic similarity metrics.},

  abstract={Network architectures assisted by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) are envisioned as foundational elements of sixth-generation (6G) communication system. To deliver ubiquitous intelligent services and meet diverse service requirements, 6G network architecture should offer personalized services to various mobile devices. Federated learning (FL) with personalized local training, as a privacy-preserving machine learning (ML) approach, can be applied to address these challenges. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning-based personalized FL (PFL) method that improves both communication and computation efficiency by utilizing over-the-air computations. Its “pretraining-and-fine-tuning” principle makes it particularly suitable for enabling edge nodes to access personalized GAI services while preserving local privacy. Experiment results demonstrate the outperformance and efficacy of the proposed algorithm, and notably indicate enhanced communication efficiency without compromising accuracy.},

This paper introduces a novel framework for identifying images generated by AI by leveraging Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining (CLIP) and Frequency analysis. CLIP provides semantic understanding by aligning visual content with textual descriptions, enabling the assessment of contextual coherence. Concurrently, frequency analysis detects anomalies in spatial frequency patterns, such as unnatural textures and spectral inconsistencies, which are indicative of synthetic generation. By combining CLIP's contextual analysis with frequency-based structural insights, the proposed method achieves enhanced detection performance.

  abstract={Prediction on electricity load time series of commercial building and construction sets plays an important role in smart grid applications, building operation and environmental protection, etc. It differs significantly from the traditional aggregated electricity time series prediction problem and aims to provide more accurate prediction for each building respectively. In recent years, deep learning shows significant improvements on time series prediction over classical methods. However, it suffers from the problem of limited data. The problem is more serious in the context of electricity time series prediction of buildings. For instance, new buildings or buildings with newly installed meters have limited historical data, which results in poor model training and forecasts. In this paper we propose a novel generative adversarial learning based prediction method for dealing with this problem. We employ the generative adversarial network framework to obtain adversarially generated data for prediction model training by using long short-term memory units based recurrent neural network and attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on real-life dataset demonstrate the improvements of our proposed method against the traditional methods.},

  pages={1786-1790},
  abstract={This study explores the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to detect AI deepfakes and fraudulent activities in online payment systems. With the growing prevalence of deepfake technology, which can manipulate facial features in images and videos, the potential for fraud in online transactions has escalated. Traditional security systems struggle to identify these sophisticated forms of fraud. This research proposes a novel GAN-based model that enhances online payment security by identifying subtle manipulations in payment images. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of real-world online payment images and deepfake images generated using advanced GAN architectures, such as StyleGAN and DeepFake. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately distinguish between legitimate transactions and deepfakes, achieving a high detection rate above 95%. This approach significantly improves the robustness of payment systems against AI-driven fraud. The paper contributes to the growing field of digital security, offering insights into the application of GANs for fraud detection in financial services.},

  abstract={In recent years, the quality of synthetic media has significantly improved. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based generation, editing, or style transfers are so real to be detected with the naked eye. This research covers the domain of AI -generated fake imagery, which happens when someone adopts another's identity. This transfer includes expression, emotion, hair, and makeup, but it also extends beyond these specific styles. We propose a dataset to power deep-fake forensics. The generated GHOST-DF dataset contains 97212 males and 65715 females, synthetically swapped facial images. The employed method for generation is the Generative High-fidelity One Shot Transfer (GHOST). The target dataset contains 15270 and 14731 real images of males and females extracted from CelebAMask-HQ. A state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning-based universal deepfake detector is used to validate the proposed dataset. On running inference, a signifi-cant drop in the performance of the employed SOTA framework, i.e., Universal Fake Detector, to 64.6% has been observed. Using transfer learning, we fine-tuned the detector model and achieved an overall performance improvement of 97.9 % for our introduced dataset. Furthermore, the fine-tuned model is tested on other fake datasets to establish its generalization ability. The project page is https:/hdthub.com/anushka0415/GHOST-DF.},

  abstract={The widespread adoption of electronic health records and digital healthcare data has created a demand for data-driven insights to enhance patient outcomes, diagnostics, and treatments. However, using real patient data presents privacy and regulatory challenges, including compliance with HIPAA [1] and GDPR [2]. Synthetic data generation, using generative AI models like GANs [3] and VAEs [4], offers a promising solution to balance valuable data access and patient privacy protection. In this paper, we examine generative AI models for creating realistic, anonymized patient data for research and training [5], explore synthetic data applications in healthcare, and discuss its benefits, challenges, and future research directions. Synthetic data has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by providing anonymized patient data while preserving privacy and enabling versatile applications.},

  abstract={This paper has the objective of describing the structure and placing in a taxonomy the Artificial Adaptive Systems (AAS). These systems form part of the vast world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) nowadays called more properly Artificial Sciences (AS). Artificial Sciences means those sciences for which an understanding of natural and/or cultural processes is achieved by the recreation of those processes through automatic models. In particular, Natural Computation tries to construct automatic models of complex processes, using the local interaction of elementary micro-processes, simulating the original process functioning. Such models organize themselves in space and time and connect in a non-linear way to the global process they are part of, trying to reproduce the complexity through the dynamic creation of specific and independent local rules that transform themselves in relation to the dynamics of the process. Natural Computation constitutes the alternative to Classical Computation (CC). This one, in fact, has great difficulty in facing natural/cultural processes, especially when it tries to impose external rules to understand and reproduce them, trying to formalize these processes in an artificial model. In Natural Computation ambit, Artificial Adaptive Systems are theories which generative algebras are able to create artificial models simulating natural phenomenon. The learning and growing process of the models is isomorphic to the natural process evolution, that is, it's itself an artificial model comparable with the origin of the natural process. We are dealing with theories adopting the "time of development" of the model as a formal model of "time of process" itself. Artificial Adaptive Systems comprise Evolutive Systems and Learning Systems. Artificial Neural Networks are the more diffused and best-known Learning Systems models in Natural Computation. For this reason we present in this paper an application of new Artificial Adaptive Systems to a very hard and pragmatic topic: drug trafficking. That because we think that "real world" is often the best theory.},

  year={2023},

  abstract={The impact of Internet of Things (IoT) has become increasingly significant in smart manufacturing, while deep generative model (DGM) is viewed as a promising learning technique to work with large amount of continuously generated industrial Big Data in facilitating modern industrial applications. However, it is still challenging to handle the imbalanced data when using conventional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based learning strategies. In this article, we propose a distribution bias aware collaborative GAN (DB-CGAN) model for imbalanced deep learning in industrial IoT, especially to solve limitations caused by distribution bias issue between the generated data and original data, via a more robust data augmentation. An integrated data augmentation framework is constructed by introducing a complementary classifier into the basic GAN model. Specifically, a conditional generator with random labels is designed and trained adversarially with the classifier to effectively enhance augmentation of the number of data samples in minority classes, while a weight sharing scheme is newly designed between two separated feature extractors, enabling the collaborative adversarial training among generator, discriminator, and classifier. An augmentation algorithm is then developed for intelligent anomaly detection in imbalanced learning, which can significantly improve the classification accuracy based on the correction of distribution bias using the rebalanced data. Compared with five baseline methods, experiment evaluations based on two real-world imbalanced datasets demonstrate the outstanding performance of our proposed model in tackling the distribution bias issue for multiclass classification in imbalanced learning for industrial IoT applications.},

  abstract={The advent of artificial intelligence has led to transformative changes in various industries, and the legal sector is no exception. One of the remarkable applications within this domain is the development of AI-powered chatbots tailored for providing judicial advice. The paper presents a generative chatbot and an Intent-based chatbot aimed at providing judicial advice to Indians and explore and compare the two approaches on the basis of various factors such as nature of responses, response quality, handling changing scenarios, training and data requirements and user experience in the context of offering judicial advice specific to Indian laws. The underlying technologies of the chatbots along with their advantages, limitations, and potential use cases have been discussed. For the Intent-based chatbot, 36 intents based on various Indian criminal and civil laws were created with appropriate chatbot responses. Conversely, in the case of the generative chatbot, a custom dataset of 100 conversations was curated. By analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, this paper seeks to shed light on the suitability of each approach for addressing the complexities of legal queries and assisting users in navigating the intricate landscape of legal matters.},

A basic understanding is crucial, with technology&#x2010;driven intelligence being key to Decision Intelligence. This allows us to confidently question technical decisions and ensure they're right for moving our organization forward. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can quickly learn complex patterns and respond effectively to changes in the environment and their impact on the organization. After the breakthroughs of context&#x2010;specific systems (like chess, Go, robotics, or Google's DeepMind in neuroscience) the next step is generative AI systems, which are based on neural networks, such as the ChatGPT models. To wrap up this evolution, ongoing discussions are focused on artificial general intelligence. Another area of AI technology application is classification, such as image or sentiment classification, which has direct business applications, including medical diagnostics.</p>},

  title={Multi-scale adversarial generative network for super-resolution of endoscopic images}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={High-definition endoscopic images can provide clinicians with accurate marginal information and complex lesion texture details. However, in endoscopic surgery, the image resolution is reduced due to the limited resolution of the acquisition camera, the imaging noise introduced by the endoscopic light source, and the physiological movement that causes motion artifacts in the texture of the lesion edge. To address these issues, a super-resolution reconstruction method based on conditional adversarial generative networks is proposed. To tackle the problem of blurred edge textures, a multi-scale mixed attention feature extraction module is designed in the down sampling stage, which extracts image features and enhances the weight of local areas. In the up sampling stage, high-frequency details extracted from the Laplacian pyramid are introduced. To effectively remove light source noise and improve the reconstruction effect of edge textures, a novel hybrid perceptual function is proposed that fuses content loss, style loss, total variation loss, perceptual loss, and texture loss based on L1 loss and adversarial generation loss. The discriminator uses a relative discriminator to enhance the quality of the generated images by judging how much more realistic the real images are compared to the generated ones. The reconstruction results on the Kvasir dataset and a private dataset show that the PSNR index increases by an average of 5.34 dB, the SSIM index increases by 0.10 on average, the PIQM decreases by 0.015 on average, and the LPIPS decreases by 0.074 on average, indicating that the proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in detail representation and lesion texture reconstruction, and can effectively suppress noise to improve overall visual quality.},

  pages={4961-4970},
  abstract={Deep learning has been widely investigated in brain image computational analysis for diagnosing brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most of the existing methods built end-to-end models to learn discriminative features by group-wise analysis. However, these methods cannot detect pathological changes in each subject, which is essential for the individualized interpretation of disease variances and precision medicine. In this article, we propose a brain status transferring generative adversarial network (BrainStatTrans-GAN) to generate corresponding healthy images of patients, which are further used to decode individualized brain atrophy. The BrainStatTrans-GAN consists of generator, discriminator, and status discriminator. First, a normative GAN is built to generate healthy brain images from normal controls. However, it cannot generate healthy images from diseased ones due to the lack of paired healthy and diseased images. To address this problem, a status discriminator with adversarial learning is designed in the training process to produce healthy brain images for patients. Then, the residual between the generated and input images can be computed to quantify pathological brain changes. Finally, a residual-based multi-level fusion network (RMFN) is built for more accurate disease diagnosis. Compared to the existing methods, our method can model individualized brain atrophy for facilitating disease diagnosis and interpretation. Experimental results on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 1,739 subjects from three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},
