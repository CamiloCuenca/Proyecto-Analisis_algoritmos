  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) and edge intelligence (EI) are driving the evolution of traditional vehicular networks toward the intelligent Internet of Vehicles (IIoV) by providing foundational and personalized knowledge. However, their inherently contradictory characteristics present significant challenges to direct knowledge sharing. Furthermore, conventional methods that independently optimize fine-tuning and inference lack the foresight to achieve long-term network benefits. To address these challenges, we propose the GAI-oriented synthetic network (GaisNet), a collaborative cloud-edge-end intelligence framework that integrates fine-tuning and inference. GaisNet, specifically, can mitigate contradictions by leveraging data-free knowledge relays, where bidirectional knowledge flow facilitates a virtuous cycle of model fine-tuning and task inference with a long-term perspective, fostering mutualism between GAI and EI in the IIoV. A case study illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the future challenges and directions in the interplay between GAI and EI.},

  pages={5266-5274},
  abstract={As the performance of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), such as ChatGPT, improves, content created by GAI will be distributed in the social media space, and knowledge and writings from unknown sources will be disseminated and reproduced. Now that GAI is becoming widespread, it is necessary to distinguish GAI from human intelligence, which constitutes knowledge. The data, information, knowledge, and work (DIKW) hierarchy is a useful framework for teaching and for checking metacognitive and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) literacy. There are two types of collaboration between GAI and human intelligence: a combined intelligence model and a parallel intelligence model. The combined intelligence model is a method of using GAI for creating works by collecting data, organizing information, and deriving knowledge from information. This model is suitable for GAI-assisted tasks (GAIATs). The parallel intelligence model is suitable for GAI-assisted learning (GAIAL); it is a method in which a person develops abilities by analyzing and comparing tasks created by GAI after going through the data-information-knowledge-work process. The zone of proximal development (ZPD) created by educational scaffolding is a quantitative framework that is appropriate for evaluating the effects of GAI. The ZPD generated by GAI that corresponds to scaffolding should be managed so as not to favor or disadvantage specific individuals.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence has recently emerged as a transformative technology which is able to analyze vast datasets and generate valuable insights, particularly in supply chain management. Simultaneously, the proliferation of Internet of Behaviors which collects and analyzes data on human behaviors enables businesses to gain a deeper understanding of user preferences and habits. Despite the growing adoption of generative artificial intelligence and Internet of Behaviors, their interaction and combined impacts on supply chain management remain underexplored. This study aims to address this gap by examining how generative artificial intelligence and Internet of Behaviors can be leveraged to enhance business operations. To be specific, we first review the relevant literature to identify the key issues and challenges associated with generative artificial intelligence and Internet of Behaviors. We then discuss real-world applications to illustrate the practical value these technologies bring to businesses. Based on the collected literature and industry practices, we propose a framework for businesses to integrate generative artificial intelligence and Internet of Behaviors into their supply chain management. This framework highlights the significant opportunities for businesses to enhance their supply chain performance by adopting these advanced technologies. Finally, we build a future research agenda and draw our conclusion.},

  abstract={Personalized learning refers to a system of teaching and learning where the content, methods, and assessment are tailored to each learner's needs, capacities/skills/competencies, and pace. There is abundant literature about personalized learning, describing its advantages, challenges, and approaches to implementing it. This study has explored the abundant literature and realized that while there are substantial proposed ways to achieve personalized learning, these proposals are not implemented into actionable products. This research aims to construct a Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) tutor that implements personalized learning and teaching in a higher education level course. The research methodology involved exploring literature to determine the requirements for personalized learning and designing a tutor system. The resultant system uses Custom GPT technology, Application Programming Interface (API), a repository for storing content, learners' profile information, and performance metrics. Out of the six components that make the proposed system, only the “Custom GPT” component has been implemented and tested on a course named “Applied Cryptography” in a postgraduate program. Though the preliminary results are promising, an effective assessment of the system will be made when the full implementation is completed. Further, issues related to ethics, scaling and integration with learning management systems should also be considered. Subsequent work to this study will focus on those issues.},

  abstract={We are at the dawn of a new area of AI: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), which holds the potential to automate and generate in ways never before possible and can be applied across countless disciplines from natural language processing (NLP) to image synthesis, interactive simulations, and more. Generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks and transformers, as well as cutting edge AI tools such as GitHub Copilot, DALL-E, Gemini, and Bing Copilot have made content generation a different game. From realizing intelligent code generation, realistic image synthesis, or personalized search, these tools are transforming industries to software development and digital art, to search engines. In this paper we present a comprehensive survey of generative AI technologies and the methodologies behind these technologies, including attention mechanisms, variational autoencoders, diffusion models, and transformer-based models such as GPT and BERT. The paper also discusses the implementation of generative AI across Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality, highlighting how the use of AI to generate content is revolutionizing the interactive experiences in gaming, education, and training. In the study we also perform performance evaluations of generative AI models on benchmark datasets using BLEU, ROUGE scores etc. We discuss some of the challenges facing generative AI on ethical, computational, and too-often opaque lines and predict that generative AI can transform industries by creating autonomous creativity and personalized learning.},

  abstract={Integrating generative artificial intelligence tools can allow one to manage and develop novel business methods efficiently. With the introduction of self-learning generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools, the corporate world is trying to figure out the applications and their business implications. Major technology companies like Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc., have shown enormous interest in investing in ventures developing generative AI tools/models. These tools/models can be experimented with, and their business use is being explored. The study aims to explore the potential uses of generative AI (GAI) in academics through its current capabilities and applications. The study also highlights the potential challenges and concerns arising from using generative AI in academics. The study has used descriptive and quantitative methods to answer the research questions. The study has used a questionnaire based on the Likert scale to measure the significance of indirect variables, viz. perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived trust (PT) on direct variable adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AGAI) in academics. The sample size consists of 100 students and 100 university professors. The study Mentions that perceived ease of use (PEOU) positively influences GAI (AGAI) adoption. Also, perceived trust (PT) has a predictive ability of AGIA when controlling for PEOU. The use of generative AI in a few years will become imperative in most human lives, which makes it mandatory to explore the possible ways of its adoption in the mainstream rather than avoiding or restricting its usage in academics.},

  abstract={Summary <p>What does the term &#x201c;Medical Image Analysis&#x201d; mean? Before understanding this term, we must first understand what analysis is. Analysis is interpreting data and involves drawing conclusions based on the information gathered. Medical Image Analysis aims to extract insights using various computational techniques. This process includes exploring, manipulating, visualizing, segmenting, classifying, and registering both 2D and 3D images. In addition, it encompasses reconstructing image data from medical imaging tools, like X&#x2010;rays, ultrasounds, CT scans, MRIs, PET scans (positron emission tomography), SPECT scans (single photon emission computed tomography), and microscopy. The motto is to generate visual representations of internal body parts for medical and clinical assessments. This analysis is required for automating operations of healthcare like cell counting, detecting anomalies like cancerous cells, segmenting tumor tissues, measuring oxygen saturation, and reconstructing 3D representations for diagnostic and treatment planning. These days, high&#x2010;end computing is necessary for many medical image processing and analysis techniques in order to minimize the requisite runtime. This review's primary goal is to offer a comprehensive reference for medical image analysis and morphological methods that have recently benefited from high&#x2010;performance computing technologies.</p> <p>Now, let us understand the term morphology; it is an inspection of an organism's form, structure, and unique structural characteristics. Here, we go over some of its features and introduce the fundamental morphological transformations. We also provide a synopsis of the morphological filtering theory. In conclusion, we delineate many attributes of mathematical morphology that illustrate its relevance in the medical image processing domain.</p>},

  abstract={Summary <p>Skin cancer is the most common form around the world, and its impact has risen dramatically in the early decades. Soon and perfect discovery of cancer improves patient prognosis and allows for less invasive treatments. Artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the emergence of systems that help ascertain and classify dermal images, improving traditional clinical evaluation and proving valuable where skilled labor is scarce. Its implementation requires patient genetic and cultural diversity, as well as evaluating efficacy, safety, and ethical issues. Skin cancer diagnosis requires high accuracy for effective treatment. This paper investigates how generative AI can be used to improve diagnosis and classification. It can generate realistic, synthetic skin lesion images, particularly for rare forms, which can subsequently be utilized to supplement existing datasets for training classification classifiers.</p>},

  abstract={A table-native AI model that shortens time-to-value for predictive activities on tabular data is being built by SAP. It is called the SAP Foundation Model. The goal is to build a general-purpose prediction engine that can automatically generate predictions from tabular data with minimal or no more training data. Although LLMs excel at text generation, they struggle with business-related data that is tabular and has challenges with categorisation, regression, and prediction. In fact, the SAP Foundation Model can compete with and even surpass these conventional methods while providing the flexibility of foundation models; in contrast, state-of-the-art LLMs perform 20-50% worse than incumbent restricted AI approaches in comparable cases. SAP has a long track record of successfully meeting business needs, and the company's stated goal is to develop AI that is useful, trustworthy, and socially conscious so that it can assist clients in solving their business challenges. Another innovative strategy for AI development, federated learning is quickly becoming the standard for delivering AI apps to the periphery of industrial networks. Research into the development of ethical guidelines and frameworks for the deployment of AI in MIS should prioritize the safety and security of data. In order to reap the benefits of AI integration for businesses, one must first establish a cohesive digital business plan. Another is getting people to interact with AI despite obstacles.},

  abstract={This study explores the components of prompts generated by secondary school students when interacting with Generative AI (GenAI) chatbots in an AI education context. By analyzing the interaction logs between students and GenAI chatbots, this study identified and examined 6 components in students' prompts, separately “Focus”, “Verb”, “Persona”, “Context”, “Audience”, and “Constraints”. The results reveal students predominantly emphasized the components of “Focus” and “Verb” while displaying comparatively less attention to the other components. Through cluster analysis, the study categorizes students' prompts into five patterns, each reflecting different component strategies in prompt engineering. These findings enhance the understanding of students' interaction with GenAI chatbots and provide support for designing GenAIassisted education curricula, helping educators better comprehend students' epistemic and behavioral characteristics when interacting with GenAI, thereby optimizing teaching methods and course content.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its many applications are changing our lives in ways we could not have imagined a decade ago. Generative artificial intelligence is an artificial intelligence system capable of generating texts, images, and other media based on the input training data. Although still in their early stages, numerous examples of such systems in different domains have gained widespread attention from the public, media, policymakers, and researchers. This study aims to explore the generative AI academic research in the past decade using bibliometrics, text analysis, and social network analysis. Specifically, research themes and their relationships, the evolution of research themes over time, and prominent authors, articles, journals, institutions, and countries publishing in generative AI are identified. The data was further found to partially support the classical bibliometrics laws of Zipf, and Bradford’s. The two overarching research themes identified using knowledge synthesis from most cited articles and journals are technical advancements and developments in generative AI systems; and their applications to image processing, pattern recognition, and computer vision. ChatGPT, large language models, and the application of generative AI to healthcare and education are emerging research topics. Additionally, generative AI’s usefulness to geoscience, remote sensing, Internet of Things (IoT), and cybersecurity are discussed.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (AIGC) is an artificial intelligence technology based on generative models, which has powerful capabilities to process and generate video, text, audio, and other content, and can understand and generate interactive information of multimodal complex content. This article focuses on the construction needs of new power systems. Firstly, it introduces the basic principle architecture, underlying models, and application advantages of AIGC. Secondly, based on this, it summarizes the application principles and implementation process of AIGC in four major scenarios: power system prediction, new power system analysis and planning, fault diagnosis and recovery, and power trading assistance. Compared with traditional artificial intelligence technology, it has significant advantages in small sample and multimodal task processing. Finally, the article proposes six solutions from the perspectives of dataset, computing power, and algorithm, taking into account the risks faced in the application of AIGC. These solutions provide a reference for promoting the practical application of AIGC in the power system.},
