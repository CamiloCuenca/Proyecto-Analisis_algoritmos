abstract = {The application of games in the field of education has brought new developments and updated educational needs to games. To maintain and improve students' learning motivation and interest, and more effectively carry out personalized teaching capabilities, research focuses on students' personalized knowledge structure. Starting from tracking the differences in knowledge structures among different learners, a game model based on entrepreneurial education theory has been designed. Through modeling learner knowledge using Bayesian network, the research constructs a game framework of entrepreneurial education for adaptive learning. On this basis, a new feature crossover method is proposed to construct a deep knowledge tracking model based on feature embedding and attention mechanism. It was combined with adaptive learning technology to ultimately construct an entrepreneurial education game model that integrates adaptive learning and improved deep knowledge tracking. A total of 379 students participated in the experiment. The experimental results on the ASSISTments09 open data set show that the area value under the receptivity curve of this model is 0.913, which is 8.8% to 26.6% higher than that of advanced models of the same type. The performance of the research model is optimal on different training scale data. Students' adaptability to entrepreneurship education games is higher than classroom teaching, with a difference between 2% and 11%. The experimental data demonstrates the high applicability of this research method and also achieves the goal of game design, which has certain practical teaching application value.}

Writing in the digital age has transformed from a mere communicative practice into a computational interface for multimodal creation—establishing a new paradigm where natural language functions as executable code for artificial intelligence systems. This research examines the pedagogical implications of this “Writing is Coding” framework, focusing on how learners navigate cross-media AI co-creation processes. Through a comprehensive three-round experiment, 102 undergraduate students engaged in progressive AI collaboration across textual, visual, and video modalities, using natural language as their primary creative instrument. Employing grounded theory methodology, the researchers analyzed data from student reflection journals, teacher observation logs, and semi-structured interviews to identify emergent patterns in AI-human creative partnerships. Five interconnected themes emerged: (1) prompt engineering as algorithmic thinking, (2) multimodal literacy development, (3) collaborative negotiation of creative agency, (4) emotional engagement through iterative refinement, and (5) metacognitive awareness of human-AI boundaries. Findings suggest that the “Writing is Coding” framework facilitates a deeper understanding of computational processes while enhancing creative expression. The three-round progression demonstrated increasing student comfort with AI collaboration, though tensions around authorship and creative identity persisted. This research contributes to emerging pedagogical approaches that position writing as a form of programming in AI-enhanced learning environments, with implications for curriculum design and digital literacy development.}

abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has exerted a greater influence on EFL learners' digital multimodal composing (DMC) process. GAI focuses on creating new textual and multimodal content using large language models (LLMs), and it puts different demands on EFL learners. Although much research has been conducted on EFL learners' AI literacy in various socio-cultural contexts, more attention should now be paid to EFL learners' GAI literacy in the DMC context, a new autonomous model of literacy. It should be noted that even though some studies may concentrate on users' perceptions and experiences with GAI, which may be closely tied to GAI literacy, there lacks the development of a scale for assessing GAI literacy in DMC. Thus, this study attempted to fill these research gaps by developing and validating an applicable and generalizable instrument to measure Chinese EFL learners' multimodal GAI literacy in their DMC process. Two subsamples (n1 = 296, n2 = 294) were randomly invited to respond to the GAIDMCS, and the data were subjected to exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test the validity and reliability of the instrument. The findings suggested that a four-factor solution with 17 items can help explain Chinese EFL learners’ GAI literacy in DMC in terms of affective learning, behavior learning, cognitive learning, and ethical learning. Our GAI literacy in DMC scale may help improve GAI education for researchers and practitioners by providing a comprehensive and plausible framework that can serve as an outline for further syllabus design.}

The use of ChatGPT in program writing processes has become widespread, and this tool has a certain potential in the programming process. However, when the literature is examined, research results related to using ChatGPT for this purpose have yet to be found. The existing literature has a gap that requires exploration. This study aims to analyze the students' perspectives on using ChatGPT in the field of programming and programming learning. The study encompassed a cohort of 41 undergraduate students enrolled in a public university's Computer Technology and Information Systems department. The research was carried out within the scope of the Object-Oriented Programming II course for eight weeks. Throughout the research process, students were given project assignments related to the course every week, and they were asked to use ChatGPT while solving them. The research data was collected using a form consisting of open-ended questions and analyzed through content analysis. The research findings revealed both the advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT usage, as perceived by the students. The students stated that the main benefits of using ChatGPT in programming learning are providing fast and mostly correct answers to questions, improving thinking skills, facilitating debugging, and increasing self-confidence. On the other hand, the main limitations of using ChatGPT in programming education were getting students used to laziness, being unable to answer some questions, or giving incomplete/incorrect answers, causing professional anxiety in students. Based on the results of the research, it can be said that it would be useful to integrate generative AI tools into programming courses considering the advantages they provide in programming teaching. However, appropriate measures should be taken regarding the limitations it brings. Based on the research findings, several recommendations were proposed regarding the integration of ChatGPT into lessons.}

With the visual pedagogical scaffold, for instance, mind maps, learners can externalize their comprehension and engage in meaning negotiation. However, given the limitations posed by the conventional collaborative environment such as the difficulty for groups to achieve deep discussions and generate group intelligence, the generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tool was introduced. The efficacy of the GAI tool in boosting task performance is still contested and its influence on collaborative knowledge construction remains unclear. Therefore, this study was conducted in an elective course at a university. A total of 30 student teachers were the participants, including 10 groups of 3 students. In the subsequent quasi-experimental study, 5 experimental groups employed the GAI tool and mind mapping based collaborative environment (GMMCE) and 5 control groups employed the conventional mind mapping based collaborative environment (MMCE). The results showed that the experimental groups outperformed the control groups on both collaborative tasks in the course. According to Ordered Network Analysis (ONA), the experimental groups developed a collaborative knowledge construction process in cognitive dimension, i.e., progressive interaction from individual to peer to group. On the contrary, the control groups were mainly reflected in the transition between learners' individual expression and peer interaction since they were more centered on the regulative dimension. We also supplemented students’ perception of using the GAI tool from the interview data. Finally, we highlighted the implications for pedagogy and described the research limitations as well as future directions.}

Using data from 2357 students, the results showed that the critical-reflective approach was the most commonly experienced and significantly predicted students’ GenAI confidence and responsibility. The creative-productive approach positively and significantly predicted GenAI confidence but not responsibility, while the protective-preventive approach, although the second most common approach, was not significantly related to either outcome. However, these approaches explained little variance in the dependent variables, suggesting that they may not yet be effectively implemented or that digital agency is primarily developed outside schools. Analysis of the control variables showed that identifying as a female had a negative significant effect on GenAI confidence and a positive significant effect on GenAI responsibility.

To this end, this study used 20 projects and their 957 remixes as samples to analyze creative behavior in Scratch through quantitative statistics and correlation analysis. Three research questions are addressed: (1) What creative levels are there among the remixes? (2) What relationships are there between the project and its remixes? and (3) What creative trends are there indicated in the remixes? The main results are concluded as follows. First, four creative levels of remixes based on the SOLO taxonomy are found, including feature change, appearance change, element creation, and structure creation. Feature change has the highest sum of remixes, which indicates that most remixes are at a low creative level. Second, the internal characteristics of projects are related to the lower creative level of remix, while the external characteristics are attached to the higher creative level of remix. Finally, the two-level, three-level, and four-level iteration chain of remixes are found, in which remixes with high creativity is more likely to inspire remixes with lower or equal creativity. Based on these results, suggestions for further research and improvement are discussed. This study has important implications for understanding the creative level of remix among users in programming community and guiding users to make valuable remixes.}

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are increasingly being integrated into educational environments, prompting questions about their actual impact on student learning. While a growing body of literature reports anecdotal or correlational evidence of GenAI's educational potential, rigorous causal evaluations remain limited. To bridge this gap, this study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental and quasi-experimental studies investigating the effect of GenAI on learning outcomes. Following PRISMA guidelines, we screened five academic databases and identified 68 relevant studies published between 2022 and 2025. These studies yielded a total of 337 effect sizes across various educational levels, subject domains, and instructional contexts. The meta-analysis revealed a moderate overall positive effect of GenAI on learning outcomes (SMD = 0.45, 95 % CI [0.43, 0.47]), suggesting that GenAI-supported interventions are generally more effective than traditional instruction. However, substantial heterogeneity was observed across studies (I2 = 95 %), indicating that the magnitude of GenAI's impact varies significantly depending on contextual and methodological factors. Moderator analyses revealed stronger effects in primary and secondary education, within natural science disciplines, and in short-term interventions with smaller sample sizes. These patterns point to both the promise and the complexity of GenAI integration in educational practice. In conclusion, while GenAI shows considerable promise for enhancing learning outcomes, its true potential will only be realized through sustained, efforts to evaluate how, when, and for whom these technologies work best in diverse learning ecosystems.}

Teaching Java programming to beginners in blended digital and classroom learning settings presents challenges in fostering skill progression and maintaining engagement. Regular learning methods often fail to support the sequential development of computational thinking and programming proficiency.
Objective
This study introduces an agile learning strategy aimed at improving Java programming skills in beginners. The strategy emphasizes step-by-step learning of core concepts through visual programming games and repetitive practice to enhance both engagement and skill development.
Method
The agile learning strategy was applied in a blended learning environment, incorporating interactive programming tools, continuous feedback, and repetition. A comparative analysis was conducted between two groups: one using the agile strategy and another following regular learning methods. Improvements in computational thinking and Java programming skills were assessed.
Results
Learners using the agile strategy showed significant improvements in both computational thinking and Java programming skills, outperforming those in the regular learning group. However, variations in individual performance suggest that learner-specific factors may affect outcomes.}

To uncover the cognitive mechanism underlying the interplay between CT and creativity, we conduct a scoping review of 26 empirical studies published in 2006–2024. Our findings suggested that the effects of working memory varied in the interplay between CT and creativity due to differences in age range, neural network activation regions, and measurements. Intellectual abilities, including algorithmic fluency, reasoning ability, and coding ability, showed cognitive transfer effect on CT skills but not necessarily on creativity, suggesting that cognitive abilities embracing more intelligent elements may contribute to the functional connectivity in CT neural networks but only partly overlapped with creativity involved networks. Although executive functions (working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control) play a crucial role in both CT and creativity, their contributions to the CT-creativity interplay are still rarely studied. Future research should explore the CT-creativity relationship from the perspective of neuroscience.}

abstract = {Surveys and interviews—structured, semi-structured, or unstructured—are widely used for collecting insights on emerging or hypothetical scenarios. Traditional human-led methods often face challenges related to cost, scalability, and consistency. For example, distributed questionnaires lack the ability to provide real-time guidance and request immediate clarifications. Recently, various domains have begun to explore the use of conversational agents (chatbots) powered by generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, considering decisions in transportation investments and policies often carry significant socioeconomic and environmental consequences, surveys and interviews face unique challenges in integrating AI agents. This issue underscors the need for a rigorous, explainable, and resource-efficient approach that enhances participant engagement and ensures privacy. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a modular approach accompanied by a parameterized process for designing and deploying AI agents for surveys and interviews, thereby supporting decision-makings in high-stakes contexts. We detail the system architecture, integrating engineered prompts, specialized knowledge bases, and customizable, goal-oriented conversational logic. We demonstrate the adaptability, generalizability, and efficacy of our modular approach through three empirical studies: (1) travel preference surveys, highlighting conditional logic and multimodal (voice, text, and image generation) capabilities; (2) public opinion elicitation on a newly constructed, novel infrastructure project, showcasing question customization and multilingual (English and French) capabilities; and (3) expert consultations about the impact of technologies on future transportation systems, highlighting real-time, clarification request capabilities for open-ended questions, resilience in handling erratic inputs, and efficient transcript postprocessing. The results suggest that the AI agent increases completion rates and response quality. Furthermore, the modular approach demonstrates controllability, flexibility, and robustness while addressing key ethical, privacy, security, and token consumption concerns. We believe this work lays the foundation for next-generation surveys and interviews in transportation research.}

The study conducted path analyses on 16,148 secondary school students in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, China in PISA 2022. The results showed that growth mindsets, ICT self-efficacy, and creative environments can directly promote their creative self-efficacy and thinking, while school environments negatively impact creative thinking. Besides, online information practices mediate the relationship between predictors, CSE, and creative thinking. However, ICT feedback and support do not serve as mediators for creative thinking. ICT availability at school positively affects CSE through ICT feedback, while ICT availability outside of school has a negative effect. This study highlights the combined influence of individual traits, behaviors, and external environments on students’ creative thinking, providing valuable insights for educators to take a holistic approach to fostering student development.}

As a result of the descriptive analysis, five main themes were identified: critical content production and evaluation, metacognitive skills and self-regulation, ethical thinking and evaluation, analytical thinking and problem solving, motivation and self-efficacy for the AI-assisted writing process and critical literacy skills. Our findings show that students use AI tools not as a simple copy-paste tool, but as a supportive element to develop their thinking. Students question AI outputs, synthesize them with their own ideas and manage their writing processes more consciously. The findings of our study reveal that AI-assisted writing experiences increase students' ethical awareness of originality, academic honesty and creativity, improve their systematic thinking skills in complex writing tasks, and increase their motivation to write. However, the lack of any study at preschool level, the limited number of studies at primary school level, and the scarcity of qualitative studies indicate that more research is needed in this field.}

Participants were predominantly White, female teachers serving in rural schools. A mixed-methods analysis of survey responses revealed that teachers were generally underprepared for integrating GenAI, with fewer than half incorporating it into their educational practices. Unlike the widespread classroom integration patterns observed with general educational technologies, teachers in this study tended to use GenAI for out-of-classroom duties (i.e., lesson preparation, assessment, and administrative tasks) rather than for real-time teaching and learning. These preferences could be attributed to key barriers teachers faced, including doubts about GenAI's ability to manage risks (i.e., technology value beliefs), reduced human interaction in instruction (i.e., pedagogical beliefs), ethical considerations, and the absence of policies and guidance. This study highlights the need to develop support systems and targeted policies to facilitate teachers' GenAI integration, offering implications for Idaho's education system and the broader U.S. context.}

abstract = {Background
Nursing education increasingly emphasizes academic writing and communication, critical for delivering quality patient care and professional advancement. Rapidly emerging artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot are transforming educational methodologies, and a focus is being placed on embedding AI literacy to effectively bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and clinical practice. These technologies have the potential to reshape nursing education in a technology-driven health-care landscape.
Aim
This study investigated the effectiveness of AI literacy and the application of ChatGPT and Copilot in academic nursing report writing. It assessed the level of AI literacy of nursing students, examined the integration of basic AI concepts into a curriculum, and analyzed the impact of these tools compared with traditional teaching methods.
Methods
The study adopted a sample of 203 senior nursing students from Southern Taiwan to compare an AI-enhanced teaching approach using ChatGPT and Copilot with conventional methods. The curriculum, centered on the “Writing Case Reports and Seminars” course, employed the Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate model and incorporated scaffolding techniques to synergistically integrate clinical skills with academic learning. AI literacy was measured using the Meta AI Literacy Scale (MAILS). Summative assessments, adhering to the Taiwan Nursing Association standards, focused on individual and group case report evaluations.
Findings
Following an 18-week AI intervention, the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in all dimensions of the MAILS. A ChatGPT usage of 100 % was found, with a notable enhancement discovered in the “Nursing Plan” section of case reports. Although the experimental group outperformed the control group in overall case report evaluations, the connections between identified problems and proposed plans were weaker and nursing interventions tended to be less individualized for the experimental group.
Conclusions
The incorporation of AI tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot into a scaffolding teaching framework significantly boosted students' AI literacy and performance in summative assessments. Effective AI training for students, supervised use of these tools, and continuous professional development for educators are paramount to successful implementation. Addressing the current limitations of AI has the potential to further improve academic writing, foster critical thinking, and ensure responsible application in patient care, ultimately leading to higher-quality and more effective nursing education.}

Twenty-one relevant sources were identified, discussing GenAI usage with neurodivergent students, the analysis revealed discussion of several predominant applications, including personalized learning, administrative assistance for educators, and development of individualized education plans. The review identified both promising approaches and significant concerns. Benefits included GenAI's potential to provide real-time, personalized support for students as well as reducing administrative burdens for educators. However, notable concerns emerged regarding information accuracy, over-reliance on AI, privacy considerations, and the need for human oversight. The limited empirical evidence base was particularly striking, with only nine studies providing original research data. The review identified critical gaps in current understanding, particularly regarding GenAI's effectiveness across different neurodivergent conditions and curriculum areas, and little evidence of approaches detailed in ways that educators could use. This scoping review demonstrates the need for robust empirical research examining GenAI usage in learning for neurodivergent students. These insights are timely and crucial for educators, researchers, and policymakers working to harness GenAI's potential in supporting neurodivergent learners within inclusive educational environments.}

Based on ICILS 2018 data, this research identifies factors contributing to gender divides in CIL and CT using regression and decomposition methods. Findings indicate that females outperform males in CIL, while males excel in CT. Gender divides decrease as the percentiles of students’ proficiency levels increase. The explained portion of the gender divide in CIL and CT is consistently smaller than the unexplained portion across countries, suggesting that gender divide or unobserved factors may drive these divides. A comparison of OLS regression results with decomposition approaches indicates that the factors influencing digital literacy development differ from those contributing to the gender divide. Variation in the factors contributing to gender divides is greater across countries than within countries for both CIL and CT. These findings highlight the need to consider national digital environments and socio-cultural contexts in addressing gender divides in digital literacy.

abstract = {The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools has given rise to a growing discussion of the potential challenges and benefits that the use of these technologies may present in the field of education. This study examines the acceptance of the use of GenAI tools for teaching and learning among primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong. It uses an extension of the technology acceptance model (TAM) with a modified framework that incorporates two key factors: self-efficacy and subjective norm. Data were collected from a sample of 367 primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong using questionnaires containing items for six constructs: self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude towards using, subjective norm, and behavioural intention. The results show that fostering teachers' self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, and attitude is essential for successfully increasing their behavioural intention to use GenAI tools. Subjective norm was also found to influence teachers' behavioural intention. To enhance teachers' effective use of GenAI for teaching, teacher development programmes should focus on equipping teachers with comprehensive conceptual knowledge and skills and an understanding of the application of these tools to teaching and learning. Policy support to create a conducive environment for the use of GenAI in teaching and learning would also be beneficial. The study has theoretical implications in its extension of the TAM model as well as implications for enhancing teachers’ AI literacy and developing pedagogies for the meaningful use of GenAI tools for teaching and learning in K–12 settings.}

abstract = {This systematic state-of-the-art review synthesizes findings from 50 studies examining the integration of GenAI into active learning models (such as problem-based learning, collaborative learning, and inquiry-based learning) within STEM education from high school to graduate levels. The analysis identifies five overarching categories of human–GenAI interaction: Tutoring, Co-creating, Processing, Coaching, and Simulating, primarily leveraged to support individual learners in developing problem-solving, critical thinking, and computational thinking skills. While the findings highlight GenAI's potential to support constructivist active learning, its application remains largely individual in scope. Moreover, challenges related to algorithmic bias, information reliability, privacy, and limited domain specificity constrain the orchestration of synergistic human-GenAI interaction, placing significant pedagogical demands on both educators and learners when interacting with GenAI-powered applications. Future research should explore how human-GenAI interactions can be orchestrated to support more active, collaborative, and context-sensitive learning environments. This includes supporting students in developing the competencies necessary to engage, individually and collaboratively, with GenAI tools reflectively, purposefully, and meaningfully in ways that enhance active learning.}

Teachers, in particular, face increasing demands to respond to AI-driven transformations in learning environments yet lack structured guidance on which competencies matter. This paper presents the AIware Competency Model, a comprehensive framework of 98 AI-related competencies designed for K–12 education, including emerging aspects of GAI. The model was developed using an Action Design Research (ADR) approach, structured across four iterative stages: (1) a systematic literature review and analysis of 14 existing AI competency models to identify conceptual gaps; (2) semi-structured interviews with AI experts and educators (n = 5) to inform initial model development; (3) three rounds of focus groups involving teachers, policymakers, and AI professionals (total n = 46) to refine and evaluate the competencies; and (4) a competency ranking process (n = 10) to assess perceived importance across educational roles. The AIware Competency Model addresses current fragmentation in AI education research by offering a unified, empirically grounded framework aligned with practical classroom needs. It enables mapping to existing curriculum standards and supports both teacher preparation and student readiness in a world increasingly shaped by AI. The model contributes to the field by combining theoretical synthesis with practitioner input, offering a robust foundation for future research, curriculum design, and policy development.}

This study provides a systematic review of the use of log-based process data in computer-based assessments. Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guideline, we identified 2548 publications, of which 330 were finally included in this study after careful screening and full-text review. The results of this study can assist researchers in better understanding: (1) what are the trends in using log-based process data in computer-based assessments, (2) which process indicators have been constructed from raw log files, (3) what latent constructs have been inferred from process indicators and at what inferential levels, and (4) what are the benefits, challenges, and future recommendations for using log-based process data. By examining these questions, we conclude that the use of log-based process data in computer-based assessment shows many potentials for enhancing the assessment. Therefore, more study using log-based process data in various fields is encouraged to better understand test-takers’ underlying response processes during assessments. Additionally, there is also a considerable demand for validating process indicators and the generalizability of findings.}

abstract = {Programming education in primary school is vital for nurturing future-ready talents, yet primary school students often struggle with self-regulated learning (SRL), particularly in resource utilization and strategy regulation. Although human-generative AI (GenAI) collaborative programming learning might have the potential to enhance personalized programming education, GenAI's interplay with SRL processes remains underexplored. To address this gap, this study first proposed a SRL Behavior Analysis Framework for human-GenAI collaborative programming learning environments and then examined SRL behaviors of a group of sixth-grade students (n = 36) in such an environment using this framework, along with various learning analytics methods including cluster analysis, descriptive statistics and lag sequential analysis. The analysis yielded the following results: (1) Based on their learning performance, primary school students were identified as three distinct clusters: programming specialized unit (PSU), high performance unit (HPU), and low performance unit (LPU). (2) Regarding SRL behaviors, students prioritized self-control (65.8 %), followed by self-observation (19 %), task analysis (12.1 %), and behavior stagnation (3.2 %). (3) Students in PSU and HPU consistently adopted goal-oriented SRL strategies, whereas students in LPU exhibited passive dependence and fragmented strategy use. GenAI's facilitative effect in supporting learning correlated with users' SRL capabilities. (4) Students in PSU and HPU exhibited frequent transitions between SRL behaviors, whereas students in LPU had insufficient ability to switch strategies when facing programming difficulties. Based on these findings, this study proposed four forward-looking design recommendations: effectively integrating GenAI with the programming environment, utilizing multimodal data and AI for learning assessment and feedback, building a cluster-driven early warning mechanism, and conducting dynamic SRL analysis and guidance based on fine-grained time-series data.}

abstract = {Developing reflective thinking skills (RTS) in pre-service teachers remains a challenge in teacher education, particularly in the context of integrating emerging technologies. While digital storytelling (DST) has shown promise in fostering reflective practice, traditional methods often present technical barriers that hinder deeper reflection. Few studies have explored how generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools can support RTS during DST creation. This study addresses these gaps by adopting a three-dimensional framework of RTS, which included the time of reflection, objects of reflection, and levels of reflection, to guide and assess the impact of GAI-assisted DST creation on pre-service teachers' reflective patterns. Employing a post-test quasi-experimental design, eighty pre-service teachers were divided into two groups: an experimental group utilizing GAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Midjourney, Runway) for DST creation, and a control group utilizing traditional methods. Results revealed that the experimental group significantly improved RTS in time, objects, and levels of reflection. Pre-service teachers in the experimental group reflected more on problem definition and solution generation during the design stages of reflection time. Regarding reflection objects, the experimental group exhibited significantly higher reflection frequencies across self, artifacts, and circumstances aspects. Additionally, pre-service teachers in experimental group demonstrated significantly higher reflection frequencies at all levels—single-loop, double-loop, and triple-loop—compared to the control group. Single-loop reflection was the most common, while triple-loop reflection was the least frequent in both groups. These findings underline GAI's potential to scaffold RTS and enhance the DST creation process, offering valuable insights for integrating GAI into teacher education to foster deeper reflective practice.}

While cross-sectional studies have highlighted correlations between ChatGPT use and learning performance, they fall short of establishing causality. This review examines experimental studies on ChatGPT's impact on student learning to address this gap. A comprehensive search across five databases identified 69 articles published between 2022 and 2024 for analysis. The findings reveal that ChatGPT interventions are predominantly implemented at the university level, cover various subject areas focusing on language education, are integrated into classroom environments as part of regular educational practices, and primarily involve direct student use of ChatGPT. Overall, ChatGPT improves academic performance, affective-motivational states, and higher-order thinking propensities; it reduces mental effort and has no significant effect on self-efficacy. However, methodological limitations, such as the lack of power analysis and concerns regarding post-intervention assessments, warrant cautious interpretation of results. This review presents four propositions from the findings: (1) distinguish between the quality of ChatGPT outputs and the positive effects of interventions on academic performance by shifting from well-defined problems in post-intervention assessments to more complex, project-based assessments that require skill demonstration, adopting proctored assessments, or incorporating metrics such as originality alongside quality; (2) evaluate long-term impacts to determine whether the positive effects on affective-motivational states are sustained or merely owing to novelty effect; (3) prioritise objective measures to complement subjective assessments of higher-order thinking; and (4) use power analysis to determine adequate sample sizes to avoid Type II errors and provide reliable effect size estimates. This review provides valuable insights for researchers, instructors, and policymakers evaluating the effectiveness of generative AI integration in educational practice.}

Using the PRISMA model, 147 publications from Scopus database were analyzed and insights from CiteSpace and VOSviewer were combined with thematic analysis. Findings indicate that Chinese researchers, and China-based funding bodies are the most prominent in ERNIE-bot-related research with all the top 5 countries concentrated in the global north. Top themes include ‘Natural Language Model’, ‘Semantics’, and ‘Human’. Topmost publishers were Applied Sciences (Switzerland), IEEE Access and PLOS ONE with top average citations by Sensors (12.67 citations/publication). The study confirms Bradford and Price laws. ERNIE Bot's application in education has attracted notable attention, with 22.4 % of the analyzed studies focusing on this area, highlighting its strong potential in personalized learning and human-computer interaction. Findings from discourse analysis shows that it’s Chinese origin is often framed as a symbol of contextual leadership and basis for positioning ERNIE Bot as a key player in China's technological competition with global models like ChatGPT. ERNIE Bot's strengths in Chinese language processing and innovations are also highlighted regarding power relations and knowledge hierarchies. However, ERNIE Bot lags global counterparts in overall competitiveness; limitations in data diversity, political censorship, and accessibility further restricts its global applicability. Future research should explore ERNIE Bot's knowledge base, its educational potentials, especially in adaptive learning systems and the significance of contextual leadership as an educational technology.}

Nonetheless, in the context of English as a foreign language (EFL), the fundamental dimensions of GenAI literacy and its psychometric properties remain poorly defined. Without clarifying the factor structures and dimensionality of GenAI literacy, EFL teachers face challenges in effectively leveraging GenAI in their teaching. To address this gap, our study aimed to develop and validate a GenAI literacy scale for the Chinese EFL context, involving 603 EFL teachers. Specifically, a tentative scale comprising 38 five-point Likert items was administered to participants. Through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), the final scale was refined, evincing 32 items categorized into five dimensions: “GenAI Knowledge”, “GenAI Use”, “GenAI Evaluation”, “GenAI Design”, and “GenAI Ethics”. Moreover, statistical analysis also verified the scale's convergent validity and reliability in measuring the construct of GenAI literacy. We anticipate that this EFL teachers' GenAI literacy scale will guide teachers and teacher educators in enhancing GenAI capabilities for professional growth. It can also inspire them to innovate teaching with AI tools, thereby offering them fresh insights into GenAI literacy and its sub-components in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-integrated EFL education.}

Despite its significant potential, research on GenAI's role in enhancing creativity and innovation is still in its early stages. The present work advances this emerging field by focusing on the human-GenAI dyad. Specifically, we propose a formal model of hybrid creative process designed to maximize the synergistic potential of the human-GenAI interaction. Drawing on machine learning literature, we conceptualize GenAI as a superposition of latent entities. Through formal argumentation, we demonstrate that optimal creative outcomes arise when human agents actively select the most appropriate entity from the complete spectrum of potential alternatives for the problem at hand. Finally, we outline the ideal iterative process required to asymptotically converge toward these optimal entities. Beyond its practical utility for managers, our model provides new insights into human-GenAI mutual augmentation, the nature of creativity, and the skills and cognitive properties involved.}

However, there is a lack of understanding of how to use and integrate AR in real makerspace environments. In this research we use a co-design methodology to address the following questions: (1) How can AR be useful for education in makerspaces? (2) How are students impacted by the process of co-designing AR technology? and (3) What are practical considerations for integrating AR in makerspaces? We engaged in a co-design process in a semester-long makerspace course attended by 18 students in a graduate school of education. Through this process, we generated six prototypes with seven student co-designers, exploring AR use in design, fabrication, programming, electronics, and training. We also identified areas where AR technology can benefit makerspaces, such as teaching STEM skills, facilitating construction activities, enhancing contextualization of learning, and debugging. We observed that students participating in co-design demonstrated improved understanding of technology design, enthusiasm for engaging with makerspaces and AR, and increased critical thinking about AR technology. These results suggest considerations and guidelines for integrating AR technology into makerspace environments.}
