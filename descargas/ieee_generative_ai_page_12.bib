  pages={27-31},
  abstract={Arterial spin labeling (ASL) images that are capable to quantitatively measure the cerebral blood flow receive increasing research attention in recent dementia diseases diagnosis studies. However, this important and relatively new imaging modality is unfortunately not commonly seen in many well-established image-based dementia datasets, including the ADNI-1/2/3/Go datasets. Hence, synthesizing ASL images to supplement this important modality is valuable. In this study, a new framework based on a cascade of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and difference images generated from a Laplacian pyramid is proposed. This framework is novel as it is the first attempt to incorporate difference images for synthesizing medical images. Experimental results based on a 355-demented patient dataset and ADNI-1 dataset suggest that, this new framework outperforms all state-of-the-arts in ASL image synthesis. Also, synthesized ASL images obtained by this new framework are capable to significantly improve the accuracy of dementia diseases diagnosis performance.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence has unprecedented role in oncology due to which the diagnostic, patient-individualized treatment and predictive analysis aspects have been hit by a breath of fresh perspectives in this field. This survey is being made considering the basic issues and answers already suggested by AI in oncology. There exists a plethora of AI-based learning methods including deep and machine learning, and also hybrid models that have been used on various fronts of cancer care such as detection, prognosis, and drug discovery. The current article points to the positive aspects of AI and it discusses the benefits of AI technology as to the impression that it allows for an accurate prescription, individualized therapy and dealing with big datasets. However, difficulties like interpretability, privacy, and model integration into clinical workflows will continue to be major obstacles. Besides, AI Gone Wild is the dark side of inductive AI. This dilemma identifies the exigency of AI needing quality data and the difficulty of inflecting AI tools into existing healthcare infrastructures as the limitations of the current AI technology. In this context, some future perspectives are put forward; for instance, such include AI luminous radiomics, clinical decision-making with the aid of natural language processing, and the fusion of multi-omics data. This study compares AI models, namely CNNs, Transformers, and ensemble models, to classify and treat cancer. It alleviates shortcomings of dataset biases, ethical concerns, and model explain-ability and it covers a guidance list to initiate the research and development of AI in oncology.},

  abstract={Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in intelligent vehicles rely on accurate driver perception within the vehicle cabin, often leveraging a combination of sensing modalities. However, these modalities operate at varying rates, posing challenges for real-time, comprehensive driver state monitoring. This paper addresses the issue of missing data due to sensor frame rate mismatches, introducing a generative model approach to create synthetic yet realistic thermal imagery. We propose using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs), specifically comparing the pix2pix and CycleGAN architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that pix2pix outperforms CycleGAN, and utilizing multi-view input styles, especially stacked views, enhances the accuracy of thermal image generation. Moreover, the study evaluates the model’s generalizability across different subjects, revealing the importance of individualized training for optimal performance. The findings suggest the potential of generative models in addressing missing frames, advancing driver state monitoring for intelligent vehicles, and underscoring the need for continued research in model generalization and customization.},

  abstract={The scarcity of high-quality, annotated dental radiographic data poses a significant challenge to the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in dentistry. This study proposes a customized Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework for the generation of anatomically realistic synthetic dental images, focusing on individual tooth-level synthesis from panoramic radiographs. Utilizing a dataset of 612 annotated images categorized according to the FDI tooth notation system, the model was trained separately on cropped single-tooth images and full panoramic views. Architectural innovations such as residual blocks, self-attention modules, and an auxiliary classifier were incorporated to enhance image fidelity and stability. Quantitative evaluation using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) demonstrated superior image quality in single-tooth generation compared to panoramic synthesis, with the best-performing classes achieving FID scores below 100. These results validate the model's potential to augment dental datasets for downstream AI applications, while promoting ethical data practices by reducing the dependency on clinical image acquisition.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) has progressed so far in human computer interaction that it is much more natural and interesting. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) conjointly with Conversational AI is capable of processing visual alongside the textual input and generating intelligent and context aware responses, and therefore the work on a multimodal chatbot system is introduced in this paper. The proposed system extracts text from images, Natural Language Processing (NLP) processes user queries, and enhances the interaction by speech output through text to speech synthesis. In particular, this chatbot doesn’t accept speech as input modality but tries to translate text response to speech to make the interface more accessible for visually impaired users. Additionally, there is a poster generation module in the system for visual summarization of the conversations and the extracted content. The chatbot uses state of the art deep learning models and language frameworks to handle real time processing, grammatical accuracy in real time and also across different scenarios. From education, assistive technologies, customer support and all the possibilities in between, the applications take advantage of multimodal, voice enriched and visually enhanced communication to include users.},

  abstract={There is always a big influence of robotics and natural language processing in the field of automation. The current scenario of natural language processing (NLP) focuses on machine analysis and machine interpretation. By the term machine analysis, accuracy becomes an important phenomenon. So, it is named Augean that refers to higher accuracy for natural language processing which is difficult to attain involving the use of neural networks. Thus far named as Augean artificial neural network. It is one of the key branches of machine learning which is peculiar from the other branches speculating more towards artificial intelligence. NLP is now one of the key aspects in making machine learn and letting it speak. The current framework of these discusses more of deep learning. One of the biggest challenges is to make the machine learn and speak is known. Thus far processing becomes the most crucial part. Therefore, when it comes to processing there is no better idea than the brain to be involved. Now the current scenario is about making machine learn to the best of the accuracy and if there is something of great accuracy then it involves a real complex algorithm. The machine works possibly best only if the accuracy stays high and stepping on to the precision of work with better learning ability machines are remarkable. So, to frame this, artificial neural network and neuroscience have been used to make the model more robust increasing the accuracy with at least five percent to the previous models involved.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) research is becoming a growing trend as a result of recent improvements in machine learning. Development and grasping knowledge of art is perhaps the most subtle field of interest in the ongoing study of the “Human Vs AI” relationship. Several fascinating projects have grown up at the intersection of AI and art, but understanding and appreciating the beauty of art is still thought to be only human capacities. This paper discusses pertinent features and discoveries made by several scholars in the creation of AI art. Many scholars use GAN, but as this field of study continues to advance, many new techniques have emerged, including DALL-E, DALL-E 2, stable diffusion, multi-diffusion, DIFF EDIT, SEMSTYLE, LAFITE, and Mirror GAN. This demonstrates that there are numerous techniques for creating images, but the primary difficulty is deciding which technique is appropriate and used for text to image synthesis. So, we talked about some of the key techniques and their methodology. Three crucial techniques-DALL-E, stable diffusion, and GAN-that serve as the foundation for the creation of artificially intelligent art are discussed. Additionally, we talked about the way they work and fundamental design. Furthermore, there is also a section of the literature review that discusses the work, methodology, and restrictions of 8 researchers' models. These techniques significantly increase public interest in this subject. This paper concludes with highlights of some attractive application of the main theme in the current world.},

  pages={840-844},
  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) has seen the emergence of Generative Adversarial Networks or abbreviated as GANs, a promising technology that mimics the actual world inputs to generate synthetic data. This capacity is quite promising, especially in the field of biomedical imaging, where increasing the resolution of X-rays and other medical picture data may significantly enhance clinical procedures and diagnosis. However, because medical technology has limits, obtaining high-resolution pictures of medical conditions can be difficult. There are now proven super-resolution (SR) methods available to address this issue. Rebuilding high-resolution images from their low-resolution counterparts is one of these methods, which provides more detailed information necessary for precise target identification. Super-resolution’s primary objective is to raise the image’s perceived quality. Employing generative adversarial network (GAN) based high-resolution representation learning, more precisely the SRGAN model, this study offers a unique approach for SR or super-resolution of medical images. The suggested technique, called L2RSRGAN, improves upon previous models by utilizing GANs’ strengths in maintaining high-frequency picture information and recreating visual quality. Notably, L2 regularization is integrated into the generator’s residual block, which smoothest out artifacts and reduces overfitting to improve the visual quality of generated high-resolution pictures. Our studies’ findings demonstrate that our model is effective in generating high-quality super-resolved medical pictures, with a SSIM or Structural Similarity Index Measure of 0.2098 and PSNR or peak signal-to-noise ratio of 9.18.},

Different from the conventional augmentation methods such as manually adding noise or reverberation to the original audios, in this article, we propose to use deep generative models to directly generate more diverse speaker embeddings, which would be used for robust PLDA training. Conditional GAN, and VAE are designed, and investigated for different embedding types, including factor analysis based i-vector, TDNN based x-vector, and ResNet based r-vector. The proposed back-end augmentation methods are evaluated on NIST SRE 2016, and 2018 dataset. Within the popular x-vector, and r-vector framework, the experimental results show that our proposed methods can outperform the traditional audio based back-end augmentation method while different front-end augmentation methods are considered.},

  abstract={Recently, data has ousted oil as the most economical resource in the world, but most companies are reluctant to share customer/user data in pure form and on a large scale due to privacy concerns. Many innovative technologies (e.g., federated learning, split learning) are employed to meet the growing demand for privacy preservation. Despite these technologies, acquiring personal data in order to optimize utility, and then sharing it on a large scale, is still very challenging. Thanks to the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), a relatively new and promising solution to resolve these challenges is to generate synthetic data (SD) by mirroring the original dataset’s properties. SD is a promising solution to address growing privacy demands as well as the utility/analytics requirements of many industry stakeholders. In this paper, we propose and implement an SD generation method from a real dataset containing both numerical and categorical attributes by using an improved conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN), and we quantify the feasibility of SD on technical and theoretical grounds. We provide a detailed analysis of SD in original and anonymized forms with the help of multiple use cases, whereas prior research simply assumed that privacy issues in SD are small because AI models do not overfit or SD has a poor connection with real data. We provide insights into the characteristics of SD (distributions, value frequencies, correlations, etc.) produced by the CGAN in relation to the real data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the pioneering work that provides an experiment-based analysis of the quality, privacy, and utility of SD in relation to a real benchmark dataset.},

  abstract={Neurological Disorders impact a subject’s/ person’s nervous system in various ways and include a wide range of neurological conditions. More often than not, the impact is life altering and affects the subject’s communication skills, social interaction capability, etc. If the condition is detected at an early age, it can significantly enhance the quality of life of the subject with focused training, treatment, etc. Detection through brain scans, behavioral analysis, etc. are costly and time consuming. Recently artificial intelligence (AI) models are being increasingly used for detection & classification of neurological disorders based on various parameters and datasets. However, for an end user, it’s still very difficult to realize the power of these models end to end viz., from data acquisition to generating recommendations. Hence, in this paper, we present the architecture of an Information Superhighway in the form of AI pipeline. The task of the Information Superhighway is to enable capturing the multimodal data (image, video, etc.) of a subject from a smartphone of a laptop webcam, and send this through a secure information channel to a cloud storage. On the storage, the data is managed using various Big Data technologies and is acted upon by the DL models. The generated recommendations are sent back through a different secure communication channel back to the mobile or laptop. We feel that our work is first of its kind which makes the technology transfer possible for the end user and utilize full the prowess of powerful AI models.},

  abstract={Supply chains for Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are more vulnerable to increasing occurrence of disruption events. These disruptions have a significant impact on their operations’ continuity and performance which results in a loss of customer satisfaction and their market share. Building a resilient SC is a significant challenge for such enterprises due to their limited resources. In this paper, we present the integration of generative AI in a decision-making framework to enhance supply chain resilience (SCR) for SMEs. The ability of Artificial intelligence to generate new scenarios and analyze large data has been integrated at different stages of the decision-making framework. Starting from the initial stage of the framework, AI-generated novel scenarios aid in risk identification. Later, the decision-making framework can get insights from AI in order to trigger optimal mitigation strategies. The AI-integrated framework aims to speed up the decision-making process by identifying, analyzing, and evaluating optimal mitigation strategies to overcome disruption risks and to achieve the objective of SC resilience. Our study provides a practical tool for SMEs to achieve resiliency for their SCs.},

  abstract={The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technology in the realm of art and design has demonstrated significant positive effects on designers and related industries. The current study aimed to explore and evaluate the factors and personal traits that drive Generation Z to embrace GenAI-assisted design. The study model incorporated factors derived from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2), the Technology Readiness Index, and the concept of trait curiosity. Empirical validation was conducted using data collected from 326 participants in the southeast of Chinese Mainland. The results of structural equation modeling indicated that: 1) Factors such as effort expectancy, price value, and hedonic motivation from UTAUT2 have a positive influence on the intention to use GenAI, while performance expectancy does not show a statistically significant effect. 2) Both optimism and creativity significantly contribute to performance expectancy, effort expectancy, price value, and hedonic motivation. 3) Trait curiosity has a significant positive impact on both optimism and the intention to use GenAI. The research findings suggest the need for further improvements in the construction and operational strategies of GenAI platforms and provide practical insights for enhancing Generation Z’s intention to utilize such platforms.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the science of protein discovery dramatically, making tremendous progress in drug discovery, protein structure prediction, and precision medicine. The current study examines the crucial role of AI, i.e., via machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), in transforming our knowledge, modeling, and use of proteins in therapeutic design. Such breakthrough frameworks as AlphaFold and RosettaFold have shown AI's unmatched ability to predict protein structures at experimental accuracy, minimizing time and expense associated with conventional means. Furthermore, AI's assistance in the discovery of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and drug repurposing has presented novel avenues to boost drug discovery and enhance current drugs. The combination of multi- omics data has augmented the contribution of AI to personalized medicine to facilitate the design of protein-based therapies for individual patients to optimize therapeutic effects. Nevertheless, issues such as data quality, model interpretability, and constraints on computing power continue to hinder the extensive use of AI in protein discovery. Ethical considerations, such as data protection and transparency of AI models in clinical environments, need to be addressed with caution. Future work needs to focus on enhancing model interpretability, enriching dataset quality, and promoting the use of AI models with conventional experimental frameworks to unlock AI's transformative potential in the battle against disease and the expansion of precision medicine.},

  abstract={Medical image synthesis is gaining popularity using generative models. latent diffusion models have recently shown promise in producing remarkably life-like representations of items. However, their ability to produce medical imagery has not yet been investigated. We investigate the possibility of latent diffusion models for the synthesis of different medical modalities. Initially, we create MRI images of the brains using a pre-trained DALLE-3 model given an input text prompt. Second, we create synthetic images and use 2300 MRI and 1300 CT images to train a stable diffusion model. Through a qualitative study, we assess the synthetic image data by having two impartial specialists MRI and CT modalities to classify randomly selected samples from the created data as authentic (real), fraudulent (phony), or unclear. Findings show that images produced using the diffusion model can convey qualities that are otherwise highly specific to certain medical conditions in MRI and CT modalities. This paper aims to introduce diffusion models rather than state-of-the-art generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and provide impetus for the medical image synthesis research community to investigate their possibilities.},

  abstract={Mobile-edge computing (MEC) is a new computing paradigm that enables cloud computing and information technology (IT) services to be delivered at the network’s edge. By shifting the load of cloud computing to individual local servers, MEC helps meet the requirements of ultralow latency, localized data processing, and extends the potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) for end-users. However, the crosscutting nature of MEC and the multidisciplinary components necessary for its deployment have presented additional security and privacy concerns. Fortunately, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can cope with excessively unpredictable and complex data, which offers a distinct advantage in dealing with sophisticated and developing adversaries in the security industry. Hence, in this article, we comprehensively provide a survey of security and privacy in MEC from the perspective of AI. On the one hand, we use European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) MEC reference architecture as our-based framework while merging the software-defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) to better illustrate a serviceable platform of MEC. On the other hand, we focus on new security and privacy issues, as well as potential solutions from the viewpoints of AI. Finally, we comprehensively discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with applying AI to MEC security and privacy as possible future research directions.},

  abstract={The exploration of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (A.I.G.C.) in art education presents a transformative opportunity for multimedia programs, particularly within the Department of Comic Arts (D.C.A.), Tainan University of Technology, Taiwan. This paper delves into the dual studies conducted to assess the integration of A.I. art courses into academic curricula and develop cooperative production strategies using A.I.G.C. to enhance graphic computing. The primary objective of this research is to critically assess the benefits and impediments associated with the incorporation of A.I. art courses and to proffer strategic recommendations for their systemic integration into multimedia academic programs. The initial investigation aimed at integrating A.I.G.C. courses into the D.C.A. curriculum involved a series of AI-centric lectures and an extensive survey involving 92 students. The findings revealed a preference for elective A.I.G.C. courses, with most favoring lecture-based delivery over full curriculum integration. These results underscore the need for a balanced approach that respects traditional artistic values while embracing technological advancements. Furthermore, the second study focused on the “Summer Sunshine” project, employing Stable Diffusion and LoRA models to achieve high fidelity and consistency in manga production. This case study illustrated the practical efficiencies of A.I.G.C., from reducing manual labor to enhancing artistic quality, thereby setting new standards for A.I.'s role in graphic arts. Overall, the studies highlight the potential benefits and challenges of embedding A.I. art courses into curricula and demonstrate the effective use of A.I. in manga production through A.I.G.C. technologies. The findings from these investigations prompt broader discussions about the role of A.I. in art, advocating for policies that support ethical practices and nurture the coexistence of A.I. and traditional artistic methods.},

  abstract={Advancements in information technology and the widespread use of the Internet have radically transformed global communication. Yet, these breakthroughs have also intensified challenges related to privacy and data security, particularly as sensitive information is exchanged across digital channels. In response, our research introduces a novel method that leverages artificial intelligence to conceal textual data within images, thereby enhancing security and confidentiality in digital communications. This study proposes an innovative approach where AI is employed to generate high-quality images from scratch, rather than relying on pre-existing cover images. These AI-generated images serve as secure carriers for encrypted messages, ensuring that the process not only maintains optimal image quality but also minimizes the risk of detection. A distinctive feature of our methodology is the application of RGB color masking, which preserves the visual integrity of the image while intricately embedding the hidden text. Moreover, our approach supports the encryption and concealment of Arabic text, broadening its applicability and reinforcing its relevance in diverse linguistic contexts. To evaluate the efficacy of our technique, we utilize rigorous quantitative measures such as distortion levels, accuracy of data retrieval, and detection rates. Preliminary results indicate that our method achieves superior speed, enhanced confidentiality, and significantly lower detectability when compared to traditional and modern techniques. Additionally, by integrating a mix of AI models, our approach optimizes the encryption and embedding processes, paving the way for more robust and versatile applications in digital security. Ultimately, this research not only addresses critical issues of data privacy and secure communication but also establishes a new paradigm in the field of steganography and encryption. By merging cutting-edge AI technology with advanced image processing techniques, our work lays the groundwork for more secure digital communication systems for digital security actors such as government agencies, schools, telecom providers, and messaging platforms can adopt the proposed methodology for integrating text hiding in different languages into AI-generated images, enabling a secure communication channel with high confidentiality and low vulnerability. This technology can also be easily integrated into existing encryption systems to enhance the protection of sensitive data without compromising image quality or network performance. And invites further exploration into innovative security solutions for the future.},

  abstract={The emergence of Generative AI (GenAI) has posed significant challenges to various institutions since its launch. The education sector, in particular, requires an urgent regulatory framework. This work provides guidelines for the incorporation of GenAI into the teaching-learning process of undergraduate students, in which generative tools are promising to revolutionize both their academic and professional trajectories. Despite ongoing debates among Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) decision-makers on whether GenAI should be used for education, students are at odds on the prohibition of its use. Instead, they promptly provided specific recommendations for their peers, after a workshop on AI basics, GenAI applications, and analysis. Five student groups of divergent engineering fields collaboratively proposed usage guidelines for ChatGPT in the learning-teaching process. The authors categorized, compared, and consolidated these into a Decalogue of Use. Employing a qualitative methodology, these guidelines were contrasted with those issued by four institutions: UNESCO, Universidad de los Andes, University of Wisconsin–Madison, and Universidad Iberoamericana. Notably, these institutions concurred with students in only five out of the ten guidelines. These guidelines are of broad nature and therefore applicable across various sectors within HEIs. HEIs, as other governmental and international institutions, have been lagging in developing and implementing regulatory frameworks for GenAI, in contrast to the rapid advancement of this technology. This work offers valuable insights into students’ perceptions of GenAI use. Such evidence is instrumental for HEIs in making informed decisions regarding the regulations of these tools. Our findings encourage not only HEIs but also organizations and decision-makers to propagate the debate about ethical GenAI usage to different societal sectors. Promisingly, working as a community will empower us to make the best and pertinent decisions regarding the adoption of GenAI and other future emergent technologies.},

  abstract={This work is framed in the context of Challenge-Based Learning and describes how mechatronic engineering students tackle a challenge using product design tools and ChatGPT. The challenge was part of the Project Formulation and Evaluation course and involved developing proposals for an automation system in the food industry. The process began by providing students with the client's needs and training them in design tools such as the House of Quality, functional decomposition, the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis, and Decision Matrices. Students were then asked to generate proposal solutions for the challenge using both ChatGPT and traditional methods. Preliminary results from this exploratory study indicate that while the design tools initially seemed complex, students found them valuable for addressing future challenges. Integrating these tools with ChatGPT enhanced their problem-solving capabilities, providing a comprehensive approach to tackling real-world problems.},

By combining the strengths of the three technologies, BAAN significantly improves the performance and adaptability of natural language processing tasks. Firstly, BERT's powerful language representation capability is used to provide rich semantic information for the model. Secondly, by utilizing the adversarial training mechanism between the generator and discriminator in GAN s, the model can enhance its understanding of data distribution and improve the quality of the text it generates. Finally, domain adaptive technology is introduced to make the model better adapt to the data distribution in different fields and improve the generalization ability of the model. The experimental results show that BAAN performs well in many natural language processing tasks and can capture key information in text more accurately than traditional methods. This fully confirms the effectiveness and practical application of the BAAN architecture in the field of natural language processing, presenting a new technical method for achieving more advanced cross-domain text processing capabilities.},

Unlike traditional AI fashions that cognizance in the main on class and reputation obligations, generative AI excels at producing pics, text, tune, and films, which drives innovation and operational performance across a couple of industries. This examine explores the impact of generative AI, evaluating its packages, overall performance metrics, and emerging traits using a complete dataset from Kaggle that includes numerous statistics kinds such as pics, textual content, track, and video. The research technique includes a radical manner of information collection, rigorous preprocessing, and distinct function extraction and engineering. Data preprocessing is important, related to the removal of replica records, addressing missing values through imputation techniques, and standardizing records codecs to make certain consistency and reliability. Feature extraction focuses on figuring out key attributes associated with generative AI applications and their effect on commercial enterprise performance. Feature engineering extends this through growing and selecting new metrics to seize the nuanced elements of AI improvements. Classification is completed the usage of both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to successfully categorize and examine the effect of generative AI on exclusive commercial enterprise procedures.

  abstract={Continual learning (CL), or the ability to acquire, process, and learn from new information without forgetting acquired knowledge, is a fundamental quality of an intelligent agent. The human brain has evolved into gracefully dealing with ever-changing circumstances and learning from experience with the help of complex neurophysiological mechanisms. Even though artificial intelligence takes after human intelligence, traditional neural networks do not possess the ability to adapt to dynamic environments. When presented with new information, an artificial neural network (ANN) often completely forgets its prior knowledge, a phenomenon called catastrophic forgetting or catastrophic interference. Incorporating CL capabilities into ANNs is an active field of research and is integral to achieving artificial general intelligence. In this review, we revisit CL approaches and critically examine their strengths and limitations. We conclude that CL approaches should look beyond mitigating catastrophic forgetting and strive for systems that can learn, store, recall, and transfer knowledge, much like the human brain. To this end, we highlight the importance of adopting alternative brain-inspired data representations and learning algorithms and provide our perspective on promising new directions where CL could play an instrumental role.},

  abstract={Anomaly detection has wide applications in machine intelligence but is still a difficult unsolved problem. Major challenges include the rarity of labeled anomalies and it is a class highly imbalanced problem. Traditional unsupervised anomaly detectors are suboptimal while supervised models can easily make biased predictions towards normal data. In this paper, we present a new supervised anomaly detector through introducing the novel Ensemble Active Learning Generative Adversarial Network (EAL-GAN). EAL-GAN is a conditional GAN having a unique one generator versus multiple discriminators architecture where anomaly detection is implemented by an auxiliary classifier of the discriminator. In addition to using the conditional GAN to generate class balanced supplementary training data, an innovative ensemble learning loss function ensuring each discriminator makes up for the deficiencies of the others is designed to overcome the class imbalanced problem, and an active learning algorithm is introduced to significantly reduce the cost of labeling real-world data. We present extensive experimental results to demonstrate that the new anomaly detector consistently outperforms a variety of SOTA methods by significant margins.},

  abstract={Over the last couple of years, artificial intelligence has penetrated into every creative aspect of humankind and, in fact, provided unimagined possibilities and, of course, challenges, which traditionally were considered only to be pursued by human ingenuity. This paper examines the evolving relationship between AI technology and contemporary poetry and prose, seeking to understand how these algorithms are, in many ways, helping to shape and inform modes of literary expression. The following section will contextualize this evolution from the Gutenberg Press through to the digital age at this meeting point of technology and literature. Then, it continues with the emergence of AI as a tool for creative design, where it refers to the possibility of handling large data to offer information, generate textual content, even mimicking humanlike patterns of languages, through methods such as natural language processing (NLP) or machine learning. Further, the paper reflects the ethical and philosophical impact of AI literature on such questions as authorship, authenticity, and the nature of creativity. With reference to case studies and examples of AI-authored poetry and prose, this paper attempts to find some kind of line that might be drawn between so many different approaches by writers, scholars, and technologists who all vie to use AI as their muse. It also views the chance for the author to collude with AI and human writers and play their role in the capacity of “co-creators” or “sources of inspiration” in the literary process.},

  pages={630-634},
  abstract={Zero-shot learning (ZSL) utilizes semantic information that is auxiliary information to transfer knowledge from seen classes to unseen classes, thereby realizing the recognition of unseen classes. The generative methods train the model to generate pseudo image features for the unseen classes, thus transforming ZSL into a supervised learning problem. However, the classification performances of these methods still suffer from weak generalization. To address this issue, the paper proposes a novel Generative Adversarial Network based on Generative Feature Constraint (GFCGAN). First, based on the LsrGAN [1], a semantic constraint module is added to restrict the generated image features by keeping the semantic information consistent. Then, in the case of keeping the semantic relationships between classes consistent, the generated image features of unseen classes are farther away from the feature prototypes of their most similar classes in both semantic and feature space so as to train the generative model and generate high-quality pseudo image features. Finally, the trained classifier is used to classify images of unseen classes. Experiments on standard datasets verify the effectiveness of our model and achieve good results.},

  abstract={In smart communities, social media allowed users easy access to multimedia content. With recent advancements in computer vision and natural language processing, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models have evolved. With advancements in generative adversarial networks (GAN), it has become possible to create fake images/audio/and video streams of a person or use some person’s audio and visual details to fit other environments. Thus, deepfakes are specifically used to disseminate fake information and propaganda on social circles that tarnish the reputation of an individual or an organization. Recently, many surveys have focused on generating and detecting deepfake images, audio, and video streams. Existing surveys are mostly aligned toward detecting deepfake contents, but the generation process is not suitably discussed. To address the survey gap, the paper proposes a comprehensive review of deepfake generation and detection and the different ML/DL approaches to synthesize deepfake contents. We discuss a comparative analysis of deepfake models and public datasets present for deepfake detection purposes. We discuss the implementation challenges and future research directions regarding optimized approaches and models. A unique case study, IBMM is discussed, which presents a multi-modal overview of deepfake detection. The proposed survey would benefit researchers, industry, and academia to study deepfake generation and subsequent detection schemes.},

  abstract={Recently, generative AI has attracted much attention from both academic and industrial fields, due to its potential especially in data generation and synthesis aspects. Simultaneously, secure and privacy-preserving mobile crowdsensing (SPPMCS) has been widely applied in data collection/acquisition due to advantages of low deployment cost, flexible implementation, and high adaptability. Since generative AI can generate new synthetic data to replace the original data to be analyzed and processed, it can lower data attacks and privacy leakage risks for the original data. Therefore, integrating generative AI into SPPMCS is feasible and significant. Moreover, this article investigates an integration of generative AI in SPPMCS, where we present potential research focuses, solutions, and case studies. Specifically, we firstly review the preliminaries for generative AI and SPPMCS, where their integration potential is presented. Then, we discuss research issues and solutions for generative AI-enabled SPPMCS, including security defense against malicious data injection, illegal authorization, malicious spectrum manipulation at the physical layer, as well as privacy protection for data content and terminals' identification and location. Next, we propose a framework for sensing data content protection with generative AI. Simulation results have clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework. Finally, we present major research directions for generative AI-enabled SPPMCS.},

AI is becoming a key collaboration partner for designers, supporting them in performing design tasks and inspiring creative thought. Although studies have investigated the collaborative framework between designers and AI, its guidance for specific design practices is limited. This study proposes three designer-AI collaboration modes with typical operable processes during sketching. We conducted a user experiment to compare the effects of different collaboration modes on the quantity, novelty, variety of design outcomes, and the designer’s experience. The results show that the collaboration modes can significantly affect the sketch’s quantity and variety, as well as the designer’s overall satisfaction.

  abstract={AI has powerful capabilities in prediction, automation, planning, targeting, and personalisation. Generally, it is assumed that AI can enable machines to exhibit human-like intelligence, and is claimed to benefit to different areas of our lives. Since AI is fueled by data and is a distinct form of autonomous and self-learning agency, we are seeing increasing ethical concerns related to AI uses. In order to mitigate various ethical concerns, national and international organisations including governmental organisations, private sectors as well as research institutes have made extensive efforts by drafting ethical principles of AI, and having active discussions on ethics of AI within and beyond the AI community. This paper investigates these efforts with a focus on the identification of fundamental ethical principles of AI and their implementations. The review found that there is a convergence around limited principles and the most prevalent principles are transparency, justice and fairness, responsibility, non-maleficence, and privacy. The investigation suggests that ethical principles need to be combined with every stages of the AI lifecycle in the implementation to ensure that the AI system is designed, implemented and deployed in an ethical manner. Similar to ethical framework used in biomedical and clinical research, this paper suggests checklist-style questionnaires as benchmarks for the implementation of ethical principles of AI.},

  abstract={The emergence of generative AI (GAI) has significantly impacted education, offering both opportunities and challenges for the sector’ s digital transformation. As the use of GAI in learning grows increasingly prevalent among students, its adoption varies greatly from one individual to another. Despite this growing trend, research on students' use and perceptions of GAI remains relatively scarce. In our study, we employed a mixed-methods, multiple-case study design to explore the impact of GAI on students across four grades. We focused on six key areas: learning interest, independent learning, problem-solving, confidence, appropriate use, and learning enjoyment. Our results revealed that participants had optimistic expectations regarding the utilisation of GAI to facilitate their learning. They believed that GAI could contribute positively to all six dimensions, enhancing their educational experience. We found that college students exhibited a higher level of performance than high school students across all six aspects. The insights we gained from this study can inform future research in digital education, particularly in understanding the diverse ways in which students interact with and perceive GAI. By recognizing the potential of GAI in transforming education, educators and policymakers can better harness its capabilities to enhance teaching and learning experiences. Additionally, the findings can guide the development of GAI-based educational tools and resources that cater to the needs of students across different grade levels.},

  title={Stochastic Reconstruction Of Microstructures Based on Generative Adversarial Network Via Explainable AI System}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1027-1031},
  abstract={Random media are materials with irregular structure and spatial randomness, whose macroscopic properties are usually determined by their internal microstructure. Traditional methods for medium reconstruction are usually based on numerical simulation, but the reconstruction process is not only complicated, but also the achieved reconstruction effect is not good. In recent years, with the rapid development of deep learning, generative models (e.g., Generative Adversarial Networks) have been widely used in reconstructing the microstructure of random media. However, early GANs not only cannot effectively notice the features of the input data, but also the computational and parameter storage costs can be huge during the training process. Therefore, how to compress the training cost without sacrificing the training effect turns out to be an urgent problem. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D stochastic medium reconstruction method (3DESGAN) incorporating an explainable system. 3DESGAN introduces an explainable system into the GANs, which provides "richer" correction feedback from the discriminator to the generator. The results show that the addition of an explainable system can effectively improve the quality of the generated images. In addition, in order to control the stochastic nature of the GANs reconstruction process and enable the user to control the pore distribution characteristics of the microstructure, we adopt a style-based GAN (StyleGAN) approach, which incorporates the porosity in the form of style vectors as conditional data in the training process. Meanwhile, we utilize the attention mechanism of Transformer to enhance the ability of 3DESGAN to extract features from multi-scale training images. By comparing 3DESGAN with traditional numerical generation methods, we demonstrate its advantages in terms of reconstruction quality and efficiency.},

  abstract={Precipitation forecasting, encompassing high-resolution regional and accurate intensity forecasting, has long been a central focus in the artificial intelligence (AI) field. Generally, AI models forecast future radar precipitation sequences from historical radar precipitation sequences. However, current precipitation forecasting suffers from three issues: 1) mismatched precipitation patterns, for example, motion speed; 2) blurred precipitation field generation; and 3) inaccurate intensity forecasts. It is owing that AI models: 1) tend to simulate the average motion states and overlook individual motion (defined as the description of the motion speed, trajectory, and direction for a single precipitation sample), leading to either overestimation or underestimation of the motion speed for a specific precipitation field and 2) are inclined to filter out high-frequency components to reduce noise in the information transmission, resulting in low resolution and blurred precipitation fields. The modeling challenges impose constraints on achieving high-resolution regional and accurate intensity forecasting. Here, to the former, we propose an individual motion-driven AI (IMD-AI) method, incorporating motion matching, alignment, and refinement through constructed pattern groups. It effectively solves the mismatch in motion estimation for an individual precipitation field, ensuring global and intact regional precipitation forecasting. To the latter, we put forward a schedule sampling, patch embedding, and adversarial strategies (SPA) training mechanism, which eliminates sharp and local information loss issues during the filtering of high-frequency components. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IMD-AI achieves accurate motion estimation of individual precipitation fields and generates high-resolution regional and accurate intensity forecasting.},

  abstract={While the benefits of 6G-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) are numerous, providing high-speed, low-latency communication that brings new opportunities for innovation and forms the foundation for continued growth in the IoT industry, it is also important to consider the security challenges and risks associated with the technology. In this paper, we propose a two-stage intrusion detection framework for securing IoTs, which is based on two detectors. In the first stage, we propose an adversarial training approach using generative adversarial networks (GAN) to help the first detector train on robust features by supplying it with adversarial examples as validation sets. Consequently, the classifier would perform very well against adversarial attacks. Then, we propose a deep learning (DL) model for the second detector to identify intrusions. We evaluated the proposed approach's efficiency in terms of detection accuracy and robustness against adversarial attacks. Experiment results with a new cyber security dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in detecting both intrusions and persistent adversarial examples with a weighted avg of 96%, 95%, 95 %, and 95% for precision, recall, f-score, and accuracy, respectively.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Skin diseases are prevalent in Thailand due to the hot temperatures, humid climate, and increasing diversity of skin tones, which complicates diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) has improved skin disease detection through deep learning models, aiding faster diagnoses and reducing the workload on dermatologists. However, AI models often struggle with underrepresentation of darker skin tones in training datasets, affecting performance. To address this imbalance, data augmentation techniques like generative models are recommended. This research enhances skin disease classification using StyleGAN3 for data augmentation to balance minority skin tone classes. The Fitzpatrick17k dataset focusing on Acne, Psoriasis, and Vitiligo is used. The Fitzpatrick Skin Type Scale is reduced from six to three levels due to image availability. VGG16 is applied to classify skin tone classes. Two additional datasets, the original and traditionally augmented datasets, are used for comparison against the StyleGAN3-augmented dataset. Results show that the StyleGAN3-augmented dataset achieves the best performance with F1-scores of 0.7193, 0.7446, and 0.7543 and accuracy scores of 0.7200, 0.7368, and 0.7419 for Acne, Psoriasis, and Vitiligo respectively. The obtained results demonstrate that utilizing the StyleGAN3-augmented dataset for skin disease classification in minority skin tone classes yields the highest performance, with F1-scores increasing by 19.25%, 19.77%, and 25.94 % for Acne, Psoriasis, and Vitiligo, respectively. These findings highlight the effectiveness of StyleGAN3 in improving model performance for underrepresented skin tones in skin disease classification.},

  abstract={In the context of burgeoning cyber threats targeting Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, this paper presents a pioneering Intrusion Detection System (IDS) grounded in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The ubiquity of information technology in critical industrial processes necessitates heightened security measures, and the proposed model addresses this imperative through the fusion of GANs and IDS tailored for SCADA environments. The study delves into the evolutionary trajectory of Intrusion Detection Systems, tracing their progression from conventional signature-based methods to the adaptive capabilities afforded by artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning. Against this backdrop, the paper investigates the vulnerabilities of SCADA systems, elucidating the sophisticated attack vectors identified in recent studies. The distributed nature of SCADA systems, deployed across extensive industrial landscapes, accentuates the need for robust intrusion detection mechanisms. This research's core innovation lies in applying a GAN model to SCADA systems, leveraging the distributed network protocol version 3 (DNP3) for data access authorization. The model is trained on a dataset comprising 12 meticulously selected features from DNP3 packets, attuning it to the nuances of SCADA network traffic. Notably, the proposed GAN-based IDS demonstrates exceptional efficacy, achieving impressive accuracy. Beyond the empirical contributions, the paper envisions future directions for integrating explainable AI techniques and enhancing the interpretability of IDS models specific to SCADA environments. Moreover, collaboration between academia and industry is advocated to foster the development of comprehensive datasets that represent SCADA network traffic.},

  abstract={Music exerts an essential role in human beings' daily life. However, there are many restrictions in the field of traditional music creation. In recent years, with the development of artificial intelligence accelerated significantly, how to apply deep learning to music creation is an intriguing topic, and it is worth a wide range of exploration and discussions. In the paper, a deep learning model composed of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) was introduced to implement the generation of music. The GANs are mainly composed of a generator and a discriminator, while LSTM serves as the basic unit of the generator and discriminator. Through analyzing the music file generated in different iteration times, the results demonstrate that the pieces of music we got via the model made up of GAN and LSTM are in a similar pattern.},

  year={2024},

  number={4},
  pages={1223-1232},
  abstract={Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets have important implications for the study of degenerative diseases because such datasets have data from multiple points in time to track disease progression. However, longitudinal datasets are often incomplete due to unexpected quits of patients. In previous work, we proposed an augmentation method temporal recurrent generative adversarial network (TR-GAN) that can complement missing session data of MRI datasets. TR-GAN uses a simple U-Net as a generator, which limits its performance. Transformers have had great success in the research of computer vision and this article attempts to introduce it into longitudinal dataset completion tasks. The multihead attention mechanism in transformer has huge memory requirements, and it is difficult to train 3-D MRI data on graphics processing units (GPUs) with small memory. To build a memory-friendly transformer-based generator, we introduce a Hilbert transform module (HTM) to convert 3-D data to 2-D data that preserves locality fairly well. To make up for the insufficiency of convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models that are difficult to establish long-range dependencies, we propose an Swin transformer-based up/down sampling module (STU/STD) module that combines the Swin transformer module and CNN module to capture global and local information simultaneously. Extensive experiments show that our model can reduce mean squared error (MMSE) by at least 7.16% compared to the previous state-of-the-art method.},

  abstract={OpenAI created and published ChatGPT, an AI chatbot, in November 2022. It was developed using supervised and reinforcement learning methods and is based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT -4 families of big language models. The creation of Artificial Intelligence has started a new era in the field of computer science. Although it was first established in 1950, by, now known as the father of artificial intelligence, John McCarthy, and before that by Alan Turning who explored its mathematical possibilities, Technology is generally ranked using a sigmoid curve, wherein you have a slow take off as the technology is invented, followed by an explosion of growth depending on how useful it is. That results in improvement in the technology as people find more real world practical applications for it, and then it reaches a stagnation point where you can't improvise the tech anymore. We believe that Artificial Intelligence would be the start of a new sigmoid curve. Artificial Intelligence has now reached a new peak after the maturation of ChatGPT. Currently, AI has a gradual growth rate of 21 % per annum, creating a new market in this highly competitive industry. This paper represented the ChatGPT features, paradigm and data analysis process.},

  abstract={As one of the most common neurological disorders, epilepsy poses major challenges in clinical practice. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), which is highly prevalent among drug-resistant cases, often fails to respond to anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), making surgical intervention a necessary treatment option. Consequently, accurate identification of the epileptogenic zone is essential to optimize surgical outcomes. MRI is the most widely used non-invasive imaging technique for epileptogenic focus localization, offering superior soft-tissue contrast and diagnostic accuracy. Nevertheless, the utility of MRI can be restricted due to time limitations, high costs, or certain patient-specific contraindications. Recently, the deep learning breakthroughs have made the synthesis of MRI images from CT scans possible. However, the patients undergoing both CT and MRI scans are limited, making it difficult to obtain large-scale paired datasets. In this study, we have proposed an RSPGAN method which is based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). This method has integrated image registration and temporal lobe segmentation. In the result, the images generated by the RSPGAN method achieve an SSIM of $0.97 \pm 0.02$ and a PSNR of $30.36 \pm 4.74$, with significantly reduced error metrics: MAE of $4.93 \pm 2.82$ and MSE of $79.10 \pm 43.49$, outperforming the other models. The experimental results demonstrate that our RSPGAN method achieves superior performance on limited datasets.},

  pages={71940-71952},
  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been utilized in the education industry for enhancing student’s performance by generating spontaneous, timely, and personalized query response. One such technology is a dialogue system which is capable of generating humorous and empathetic responses for enhancing students’ learning outcomes. There is, however, limited research on the combination of humor, empathy, and culture in education. Thus, this paper proposes a dialogue system that is based on Wasserstein’s Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) for generating responses with humor, empathy, and cultural sensitivity. The dialogue system has the ability to generate responses that take into account both coarse-grained emotions at the conversation level and fine-grained emotions at the token level, allowing for a nuanced understanding of a student’s emotional state. It can utilize external knowledge and prior context to enhance the ability of AI dialogue systems to comprehend emotions in a multimodal context. It can also analyze large corpora of text and other data, providing valuable insights into cultural context, semantic properties, and language variations. The dialogue system is a promising AI technology that can improve learning outcomes in various academic fields by generating responses with humor, empathy, and cultural sensitivity. In our study, the dialogue system achieved an accuracy rate of 94.12%, 93.83% and 92.60% in humor, empathy and culture models, respectively.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a new approach to improve weak supervised classification of deep CNN architectures based on data augmentation by integrating Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) with Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN). The model is applied for hyperspectral image classification (HSI). We have chosen a weak supervised CNN classifier, where only $5 \%$ of hyperspectral training data is authentic, the remaining $95 \%$ ones being virtually generated using the model GWO-WGAN. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using Indian Pines, Pavia University, and Salinas hyperspectral image datasets.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, particularly the rise of deep learning, the importance of Explainable Artificial Intelligence has become increasingly prominent. Among its key techniques, counterfactual explanation plays a crucial role in understanding the decision-making mechanisms of opaque models. However, the high dimensionality and complex feature patterns of image data pose significant challenges for the task of generating counterfactuals for images. Existing literature has proposed various algorithms based on different assumptions, many of which rely on the existence of appropriate generative models. Some of these assumptions, particularly the assumption regarding the existence of generative models, may be overly stringent. To address this issue, this letter introduces a novel assumption-free image counterfactual generation algorithm, DFO-S, based on Score Matching and gradient-free optimization techniques. The proposed method achieves high-quality counterfactual generation without relying on generative models. Through extensive empirical analysis, we demonstrate the significant superiority of our method in terms of performance.},

  abstract={This study examines the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in enhancing personalization, analyzing information dynamics, and developing scalable methodologies within Online Social Networks and Media (OSNEM), with a focus on user protection. Through a systematic review using the PRISMA framework and BERTopic modeling, key AI applications in OSNEM were identified, including fake news detection, sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, big data analysis, bot detection, and insights into public health, disaster relief, and mental health. Although AI techniques and multimodal frameworks have significantly improved content personalization, challenges like algorithmic bias and echo chambers remain. To address these, the implementation of fairness-aware learning models is recommended to ensure personalization stays ethical. Advanced AI techniques, such as Dynamic Memory Networks and Temporal Convolutional Networks, have shown strong capabilities in tracking opinion dynamics and combating misinformation. Additionally, Generative AI offers opportunities for content creation but also raises concerns about misinformation, requiring robust moderation frameworks. Emerging technologies like Artificial Real Intelligence (ARI), which simulate human reasoning and decision-making, could further improve the management of complex online interactions. The study highlights the need for scalable AI methodologies, such as multitask learning frameworks, to efficiently handle the vast amounts of real-time data generated by social media while addressing cross-platform adaptability and computational efficiency.},

  abstract={Summary <p>In 1923, Le Corbusier proposed his Five Points of Architecture, a set of formal strategies rooted in the socio&#x2010;technological changes of that era. The following new five points summarize the opportunities and challenges ahead as we move toward an understanding of architecture in solidarity with both human and nonhuman beings. It includes: the challenge of bias, the cultivation of sensibility, the crisis of labor, the freedom of incoherence and the redefinition of authorship. The discipline of architecture has developed an unhealthy relationship with the labor necessary to produce good designs. After 30 years of digital tools in architecture, generative artificial intelligence tools are one of the only tools that help to expand the design imagination by focusing on the early design phases. However, most design tools prioritize accuracy and certainty, and as a result, they require designers to create workflows that quickly organize and structure their ideas, potentially prematurely.</p>},

  abstract={Understanding facial expressions is important for the interactions among humans as it conveys a lot about the person's identity and emotions. Research in human emotion recognition has become more popular nowadays due to the advances in the machine learning and deep learning techniques. However, the spread of COVID-19, and the need for wearing masks in the public has impacted the current emotion recognition models' performance. Therefore, improving the performance of these models requires datasets with masked faces. In this paper, we propose a model to generate realistic face masks using generative adversarial network models, in particular image inpainting. The MAFA dataset was used to train the generative image inpainting model. In addition, a face detection model was proposed to identify the mask area. The model was evaluated using the MAFA and CelebA datasets, and promising results were obtained.},

  abstract={Although it is known that the COVID-19 process is over, the subsequent damage caused by COVID-19 on the body is undeniable. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been shown to be responsible for causing acute respiratory distress in a large number of COVID-19 cases. When the literature is reviewed, Thorax Computed Tomography is recommended to evaluate permanent lung damage in individuals recovering from COVID-19. When tomography images are examined, the respiratory systems of patients who have had COVID-19 are significantly affected by the virus. In the study, thorax CT images of patients who had COVID-19 and then came back to the hospital and were diagnosed with COPD and Bronchiectasis were examined with artificial intelligence methods. The study consists of two stages. First, COVID-19, COPD, and Bronchiectasis datasets were trained with pre-trained deep-learning models. Then, only the COVID-19 dataset was trained with the GAN algorithm, and the model weights were recorded. Tests were performed on the COPD and Bronchiectasis dataset with the recorded model weight. The performance metric ratios of the training results obtained with the COVID-19 dataset and test trained individually and the combination of three classes was compared in the test environment. As a result of the proposed study, the highest performance rate for the classification method made in the first step was found to be 99% in the pre-trained DenseNet201 model. In the second step of the study, model weights were recorded on the COVID-19 dataset trained with the GAN algorithm and tested on COPD and Bronchiectasis datasets. Lower loss rates are observed in the GAN algorithm compared to the models in the first stage of the study.},

  abstract={This article discusses the Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) project’s complex ecology and how to pick the optimal models and data design. Creative AI in many commercial and academic fields presents new issues and opportunities. Knowing your way around generative AI projects is crucial. Choose models carefully since data design is hard to grasp. This research provides comprehensive guidance on how to address these areas and ensure project success. Data architecture study is the first step towards generative artificial intelligence since it identifies common issues and viable solutions. Next, to determine which generative models—in terms of complexity, scalability, and ethics—are best suited for a range of tasks, we must evaluate and compare many of them. Researchers were able to validate these findings using case studies and expert interviews. The results suggest that an ordered data infrastructure is required for creative AI. This study indicated the need to boost generational artificial intelligence programs by making practitioners and researchers more aware of the challenges. The study argues that further research and development are necessary to keep up with the fast progress of creative artificial intelligence.},

Three predominant issues have been pinpointed: the discordance of data, the authenticity of models, and the urgency required in optimization decision-making processes. In remedying these, the study advocates for the amalgamation of data augmentation and transfer learning to rectify data disparities; the amalgamation of antecedent knowledge, multifaceted data, and steadfast algorithms to bolster model reliability; and the cultivation of cutting-edge optimization algorithms, supplemented by AI-driven decision-making tools, to finesse real-time optimization.

A number of businesses created tools and frameworks to enable developers to create creative applications using these LLMs like OpenAI recently lead the big language model wave. In a similar vein, we sought to create a program called ‘Question and Answer model using Generative AI and LangChain Framework’. A number of LLMs on the market can be integrated with LangChain, as well as other data sources. With the use of large language models (LLMs), developers can now create apps that they were before unable to. To build a genuinely effective app, leveraging these LLMs alone is frequently insufficient; you must mix them with additional sources of computation or knowledge. Artificial intelligence that can produce text, graphics, or other stuff that resembles what a person would produce is known as "generative AI". It analyses data patterns using deep learning techniques, such as neural networks, and then creates new content based on those patterns. Text generating, visual synthesis, and even music composition are some of the uses for generative AI.},

  abstract={In real-world datasets, numerous class distributions are imbalanced, which severely affects the classification ability of deep learning methods. Data augmentation can address such problem by creating data for the minority class to rebalance the datasets. However, it is still challenging that how to generate data from a true distribution of given finite training data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient synthetic oversampling approach, Generator Information Enhancement Generative Adversarial Networks (GIE-GAN). Its generative information is enhanced in two aspects. First, the generator can get common knowledge of all classes by initializing with a variational autoencoder. Second, during the training process, an independent classifier, which can provide accurate classification results for the generator, is added to the GAN for further augmenting the generative information. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that, compared with the rival methods, our method can generate high-quality images and obtain better classifier performance of deep learning, especially for high imbalance ratios.},

  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been applied in many fields. However, the existing GANs and their variants encounter many problems, including pattern collapse, training instability and falling into local optimal. Therefore, we construct a lightweight evolutionary generative adversarial network (LGEGAN) with statistic global information. To solve the problem that shallow convolutional neural networks are difficult to capture long-range feature dependence and the training process is prone to pattern collapse, LGEGAN is different from EGAN in that we add an improved self-attention mechanism to the generator network. To solve the problem of instability in the training process, we add spectral normalization to LGEGAN, which increases the stability of each generation of training process. Finally, to efficiently evolve individuals who adapt to the environment in a short time and solve the problem of falling into local optimal, different from EGAN, we construct a novel selection operator and apply it to the selection stage of LGEGAN's evolution of the generator. In the experiments, we evaluate the LGEGAN from four aspects: the quality and diversity of generated images, the collapse of patterns, the stability of training and the robustness of the architecture. The experimental results indicate that the performance of LGEGAN is better than that of EGAN, MOEGAN, SMOEGAN, LRGAN, ProbGAN and the other generative adversarial network models.},

  abstract={Autism is the fastest-growing developmental condition, and as a spectrum disorder, individuals vary in severity in communication and behavior. The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) presents opportunities to leverage such technology to support autistic individuals in multiple contexts, including education, healthcare, and disability research. However, very limited research has focused on developing AI or ML-based solutions for autistic individuals largely due to the scarcity of autism-related datasets. In order for autistic people to equally benefit from the breakthroughs in AI, the data representation gap in AI and ML must be addressed. The project proposes an innovative human expert and AI combined approach to generate synthetic data about autistic individuals. Through this approach, we are developing the first dataset of case studies of autistic individuals to effectively identify evidence-based practices (EBPs) to address the unique needs of autistic individuals. The project improves the representation and inclusion of autistic individuals in the rapidly evolving field of ML and AI through both methodological innovations (i.e., the expert/AI combined data generation approach) and practical contributions (i.e., the EBP dataset that will be made publicly accessible). The innovative data generation method and supporting materials developed in this project can be generalized to individuals with other disabilities.},

  abstract={AI (Artificial Intelligence) technologies are a broad category of computer science techniques that enable machines to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing images, making decisions, and solving problems. Chatbots are a specific type of AI technology that is designed to communicate with humans in a natural, conversational way using text or voice input. Chatbots are often used in customer service and support to provide quick and convenient assistance to users. GBT (Gradient Boosting Trees) is an ensemble learning method that uses a set of decision trees to make predictions. It is a popular method for a variety of machine-learning tasks, including classification and regression. GBT is often used in combination with other AI technologies to improve the accuracy of predictions and decision-making. In this paper, we are focusing on the chat gbt and Dalle-2. Should AI will replace the human job? In the future, how much progress we can see in this field?},

  abstract={The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning presents both utility and security implications for our digital interactions. This study focuses on the transformative role of generative AI in social engineering attacks, specifically examining three pillars where it significantly amplifies their impact: advanced targeting and personification, genuine content creation, and automated attack infrastructure. The analysis forms a conceptual model named the generative AI social engineering framework. The research delves into human implications and measures to counter social engineering attacks, blending theoretical analysis with practical insights through case studies. Ethical considerations surrounding AI in malicious activities are discussed, emphasizing the importance of safe AI development, and various articles were reviewed to highlight social engineering attacks as a common threat. Two studies were conducted: a user testing study with 48 participants from diverse occupations and social engineering awareness, and an exploratory study collecting qualitative data from 40 social engineering attack victims. The user testing study revealed universal acceptance of the AI-based tool, irrespective of participants’ occupations. Victim themes included reasons for falling prey to attacks, methods, prevention advice, and detection. The research concludes by highlighting AI-generated content as a key factor fueling social engineering attacks and bridging the gap between AI development and cybersecurity practices, highlighting the need for interdisciplinary approaches to address evolving challenges.},

  number={},
  pages={272-277},
  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) play a crucial role in the dynamic fields of artificial intelligence and computer vision, notably impacting image-to-image translation. This study conducts a thorough examination of GANs’ application in image translation, providing a detailed literature review with a focus on contextual relevance. The clarification of acronyms in the keywords enhances reader comprehension. Beyond critically analyzing the limitations of previous research, the study explores strategies for enhancing the performance and accuracy of GANs in image translation. It offers a comprehensive exploration of fundamental GAN concepts, tracing their development over time, including the minimax game, adversarial training process, generator and discriminator networks, and underlying mathematical principles such as discriminator loss and GAN loss functions. The study investigates the origins of GANs, acknowledging pivotal discoveries and contributions, notably crediting Ian Goodfellow and lab researchers for their invention. This research aims to deepen understanding of GANs’ role in image translation, providing insights into their evolution, essential concepts, and potential avenues for improvement. Furthermore, experiments show that the suggested method is resistant against a variety of geometric transformations, such as translation, rotation, and combinations of these effects. These experiments are assessed using metrics like as PSNR, SSIM, incep, and FID. In contrast to the state-of-the-art super-resolution (SR) techniques now in use, the suggested method exhibits better performance on a variety of publically accessible datasets that are frequently used in research communities.},

  year={2022},
  volume={41},
  number={8},
  pages={1925-1937},
  abstract={Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been proven to be an efficient way to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent dramatic progress on deep learning greatly promotes the MRI analysis based on data-driven CNN methods using a large-scale longitudinal MRI dataset. However, most of the existing MRI datasets are fragmented due to unexpected quits of volunteers. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Temporal Recurrent Generative Adversarial Network (TR-GAN) to complete missing sessions of MRI datasets. Unlike existing GAN-based methods, which either fail to generate future sessions or only generate fixed-length sessions, TR-GAN takes all past sessions to recurrently and smoothly generate future ones with variant length. Specifically, TR-GAN adopts recurrent connection to deal with variant input sequence length and flexibly generate future variant sessions. Besides, we also design a multiple scale & location (MSL) module and a SWAP module to encourage the model to better focus on detailed information, which helps to generate high-quality MRI data. Compared with other popular GAN architectures, TR-GAN achieved the best performance in all evaluation metrics of two datasets. After expanding the Whole MRI dataset, the balanced accuracy of AD vs. cognitively normal (CN) vs. mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and stable MCI vs. progressive MCI classification can be increased by 3.61% and 4.00%, respectively.},

  abstract={Within the domain of robotics, effective interaction between a human collaborator and robot is a topic of great importance. With the continued advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), we propose a prototype system that utilizes GAI and seeks to bridge the gap between the human and robot. This prototype utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) combined with a vision system for detection and tracking, to allow the GAI system to control a robotic arm and manipulate objects within the action space. We model the action space within our experiments on the 3-cup Monte game where the user can prompt the system to manipulate the cups within the action space based on the ball’s location. Experimentation is done on prompts of varying lengths of sequences, and we evaluate our system based on its ability to understand the prompt and correctly execute the desired task. With this collaboration of techniques and technologies, we hope to open the possibilities and extend human and robotic collaboration into new areas. The results of our experiments show promising results to this end.},

  abstract={Summary <p>The ideas behind mindset are closely tied to the idea of organizational culture &#x2013; which is also often either an aid or impediment to the successful adoption of new technologies. As GenAI becomes more powerful and more widely accessible, how proficient we become at putting it to work in order to drive efficiency and create value will increasingly become a driver of success. Competition for talent &#x2013; especially AI&#x2010;literate talent &#x2013; is intense. So having put all that thought into essential skills, and equipping people with the skills for success, it makes sense that we really want talent to stick around. The base layer is fast networks and connectivity, data infrastructure, and cybersecurity. These three are the foundational tech building blocks that will help us leverage GenAI (and other cutting&#x2010;edge technologies) successfully. Before making any decisions about GenAI technologies, it's really important to get our foundational technologies right.</p>},

  abstract={Scientific production has grown significantly in recent years. Due to the considerable and increasing volume of data obtained from these publications, methods, techniques, and methodological tools and computational applications are required for bibliographic and bibliometric surveys. However, the bibliometric tools available on the market do not have all the necessary functions for a complete analysis in a single application, requiring the orchestration of a set of tools. This work presents a tool for detecting emerging technologies through topic modeling and generative artificial intelligence. Finally, the tool was applied to analyze the convergence of themes between Science (scientific articles) and Technology (patents) for the subject of virtual world, where it was possible to highlight seven topics of convergence.},

  abstract={Summary <p>GenAI will play a key role in the video game industry that one survey of video game execs found that GenAI is expected to contribute to more than half of video game development within the next 5&#x2013;10 years &#x2013; freeing up game designers from the more mundane development work and helping to reduce costs and development time. GenAI is likely to bring huge changes to the video game industry by automating some of the menial development and testing tasks, and enabling the creation of truly dynamic games. In other words, while GenAI can help to unlock huge efficiencies in game development workflows, perhaps the biggest win of all is for the game&#x2010;playing experience. In the future, GenAI will enable games to evolve dynamically based on the individual player, with characters and the storyline reacting to the player's style and strategy.</p>},
