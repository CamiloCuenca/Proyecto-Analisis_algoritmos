  abstract={The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems into technologies used by young digital citizens raises significant privacy concerns. This study investigates these concerns through a comparative analysis of stakeholder perspectives. A total of 252 participants were surveyed, with the analysis focusing on 110 valid responses from parents/educators and 100 from AI professionals after data cleaning. Quantitative methods, including descriptive statistics and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling, examined five validated constructs: Data Ownership and Control, Parental Data Sharing, Perceived Risks and Benefits, Transparency and Trust, and Education and Awareness. Results showed Education and Awareness significantly influenced data ownership and risk assessment, while Data Ownership and Control strongly impacted Transparency and Trust. Transparency and Trust, along with Perceived Risks and Benefits, showed minimal influence on Parental Data Sharing, suggesting other factors may play a larger role. The study underscores the need for user-centric privacy controls, tailored transparency strategies, and targeted educational initiatives. Incorporating diverse stakeholder perspectives offers actionable insights into ethical AI design and governance, balancing innovation with robust privacy protections to foster trust in a digital age.},

  abstract={The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies into the lives of young digital citizens has escalated privacy concerns and the need for critical examination. This study uses Communication Privacy Management (CPM) Theory to understand how youth and critical stakeholders navigate these concerns. A total of 306 participants were surveyed, comprising 146 AI professionals, 127 parents and educators and 33 youths (aged 16-19). Employing a mixed-methods approach, the research combined quantitative data from structured questionnaires with qualitative insights from open-ended responses. Descriptive statistics reveal distinct perspectives among different demographics regarding data ownership, education, transparency and trust, parental role and perceived risks and benefits associated with AI systems. Structural equation modelling identified key influences on youth privacy management, highlighting the significance of transparency and trust, education and awareness, and parental data sharing among AI professionals, parents, educators, and young digital citizens. The qualitative analysis further underscored unique concerns, emphasizing a lack of understanding and data misuse contributed to the feeling of helplessness shared by all stakeholders. This study underscores the importance of integrating diverse stakeholders’ perspectives in the development of AI systems to address the complex challenges faced by youth. Recommendations include collaborative policymaking, implementing user-centric design practices, and enhancing privacy education to empower young digital citizens.},

  title={DECIDE-Twin: A Framework for AI-Enabled Digital Twins in Clinical Decision-Making}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={29},
  number={9},
  pages={6332-6341},
  abstract={Background: AI-enabled digital twins (DTs) are advanced virtual models of a complex real-world system, which have the potential to transform clinical decision-making. Despite the growing interest in such DTs, the literature lacks a unified framework for their development and implementation. Objective: This study aims to map the existing knowledge on AI-enabled DTs for clinical decision-making, and develop a comprehensive framework for their development and implementation. Methods: Informed by frameworks established by Arksey and O'Malley, and the Joanna Briggs Institute, we performed a scoping review of studies on the development and implementation of AI-enabled DTs for clinical decision-making in any healthcare setting. The search strategy was developed by a librarian for three databases from the date of inception until August 2023. We also conducted a grey literature search on Google Scholar. One reviewer screened titles and abstracts, full-text articles, and charted data, and the second reviewer verified them. Quantitative data were summarized using frequency and proportions, and qualitative data were summarized using content analysis. Key steps in DT development were identified to create the DECIDE-Twin framework. Results: Eleven articles were included: seven reviews and four empirical studies. The reviews contained either a framework or information that was used to construct our comprehensive framework. The empirical studies reported the DT development, and one reported a common infrastructure for a wide range of DT applications. Conclusion: We developed the DECIDE-Twin framework that could serve as a guide for researchers and practitioners in DT development and implementation for clinical decision-making. Further research is needed to validate and implement this framework for various clinical applications.},

  title={Between Generating Noise and Generating Images: Noise in the Correct Frequency Improves the Quality of Synthetic Histopathology Images for Digital Pathology}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have the promise to revolutionize the field of digital pathology. However, these models demand considerable amounts of data, while the availability of unbiased training data is limited. Synthetic images can augment existing datasets, to improve and validate AI algorithms. Yet, controlling the exact distribution of cellular features within them is still challenging. One of the solutions is harnessing conditional generative adversarial networks that take a semantic mask as an input rather than a random noise. Unlike other domains, outlining the exact cellular structure of tissues is hard, and most of the input masks depict regions of cell types. This is also the case for non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type of lung cancer. Deciding whether a patient would receive immunotherapy depends on quantifying regions of stained cells. However, using polygon-based masks introduce inherent artifacts within the synthetic images – due to the mismatch between the polygon size and the single-cell size. In this work, we show that introducing random single-pixel noise with the appropriate spatial frequency into a polygon semantic mask can dramatically improve the quality of the synthetic images. We used our platform to generate synthetic images of immunohistochemistry-treated lung biopsies. We test the quality of the images using a three-fold validation procedure. First, we show that adding the appropriate noise frequency yields 87% of the similarity metrics improvement that is obtained by adding the actual single-cell features. Second, we show that the synthetic images pass the Turing test. Finally, we show that adding these synthetic images to the train set improves AI performance in terms of PD-L1 semantic segmentation performances. Our work suggests a simple and powerful approach for generating synthetic data on demand to unbias limited datasets to improve the algorithms’ accuracy and validate their robustness.},

  title={Improving Representation of High-Frequency Components for Medical Visual Foundation Models}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={44},
  number={8},
  pages={3196-3209},
  abstract={Foundation models have attracted significant attention for their impressive generalizability across diverse downstream tasks. However, they are demonstrated to exhibit great limitations in representing high-frequency components and fine-grained details. In many medical imaging tasks, precise representation of such information is crucial due to the inherently intricate anatomical structures, sub-visual features, and complex boundaries involved. Consequently, the limited representation of prevalent foundation models can result in considerable performance degradation or even failure in these tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pretraining strategy for both 2D images and 3D volumes, named Frequency-advanced Representation Autoencoder (Frepa). Through high-frequency masking and low-frequency perturbation combined with embedding consistency learning, Frepa encourages the encoder to effectively represent and preserve high-frequency components in the image embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an innovative histogram-equalized image masking strategy, extending the Masked Autoencoder approach beyond ViT to other architectures such as Swin-Transformer and convolutional networks. We develop Frepa across nine medical modalities and validate it on 32 downstream tasks for both 2D images and 3D volumes. Without fine-tuning, Frepa can outperform other self-supervised pretraining methods and, in some cases, even surpasses task-specific foundation models. This improvement is particularly significant for tasks involving fine-grained details, such as achieving up to a +15% increase in dice score for retina vessel segmentation and a +8% increase in IoU for lung tumor detection. Further experiment quantitatively reveals that Frepa enables superior high-frequency representations and preservation in the embeddings, underscoring its potential for developing more generalized and universal medical image foundation models.},

  abstract={The PRE-ACT project is a newly launched Horizon Europe project that aims to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) towards predicting the risk of side effects of radiotherapy treatment for breast cancer patients. In this paper, we outline four main threads pertaining to AI and computing that are part of the project's research agenda, namely: (i) Explainable AI techniques to make the risk prediction interpretable for the patient and the clinician; (ii) Fair AI techniques to identify and explain potential biases in clinical decision support systems; (iii) Training of AI models from distributed data through Federated Learning algorithms to ensure data privacy; (iv) Mobile applications to provide the patients and clinicians with an interface for the side effect risk prediction. For each of these directions, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art, with emphasis on techniques that are more relevant for the project. Collectively, these four threads can be seen as enforcing Trustworthy AI and pave the way to transparent and responsible AI systems that are adopted by end-users and may thus unleash the full potential of AI.},

  pages={105-110},
  abstract={Partial discharge is one of the most popular fault in power system, and the popularity of 5 G makes it possible to analyze partial discharge faults using artificial intelligence algorithms. Low frequency and high collection cost of partial discharge faults lead to the problems of small sample size and imbalance sample, which bring challenges to partial discharge fault detection of 5G based power intelligence system. Hence, in this paper, an data augmentation method that named SVAEWGAN is proposed, which based on stacked variational autocoding and Wasserstein generative adversarial network for partial discharge fault samples in transmission lines to generate fault samples and improve the diversity of samples. Firstly, the stack variational autoencoder is used to extract the depth features of the fault waveform. Secondly, a partial discharge fault sample generation model is constructed by combining stacked variational autocoding and Wasserstein generative adversarial network, and a partial discharge fault detection framework based on the data augmentation method is proposed. Finally, the performance of partial discharge fault detection algorithm based on LightGBM and Bi-LSTM-Attention before and after using data augmentation method is compared and analyzed based on VSB fault detection dataset by selecting accuracy and F1 score, etc. Experiments show that the data augmentation method can effectively improve the performance of partial discharge fault detection, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Generating diverse and realistic malware variants is critical to improve the performance of deep learning-based Malware Detection Systems (MDSs) and fight against an increasing number of complex malware attacks. Traditionally, researchers construct the single generative model based on the whole dataset, which may suffer from mode collapse and scalability problem. In order to overcome these problems, we propose Multi-level Generative Pretrained Transformer (MLGPT) which organizes multiple GPTs in the tree. Each GPT in the tree can learn the unique pattern of malware language for one malware subfamily. Consequently, MLGPT has great potentials to produce more diverse and realistic malware variants than the single generative model. Experimental results show that performance improvement of MLGPT is statistically significant as compared to the single generative model while the construction time of MLGPT is comparable to the single generative model due to the parallel strategy.},

  abstract={Transformer-decoder language models are a core innovation in text based generative artificial intelligence. These models are being deployed as general-purpose intelligence systems in many applications. Central to their utility is the capacity to understand natural language commands and exploit the reasoning embedded in human text corpora to apply some form of reasoning process to a wide variety of novel tasks. To understand the limitations of this approach to generating reasoning we argue that we need to consider the architectural constraints of these systems. Consideration of the latent variable structure of transformer-decoder models allows us to design reasoning tasks that should probe the boundary of their capacity to reason. We present enigmen, an open-source library for generating textbased puzzles to be used in training and evaluating reasoning skills within transformer-decoder models and future AI architectures.},

  abstract={Fake face recognition has emerged as a critical area of research due to the proliferation of synthetic media and its potential misuse in various domains. This study presents a thorough evaluation of a novel Fake Face Recognition Scheme utilizing Artificial Intelligence Oriented Learning Scheme (AIOLS) coupled with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-GoogleNet integration. The aim is to discern authentic facial images from synthetic or tampered ones with high accuracy. In this research, we employed a dataset comprising a diverse range of authentic and synthetic facial images. The proposed scheme incorporates the power of GANs for generating synthetic facial images and leverages GoogleNet, a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network, for discriminative feature extraction. The integration within the AIOLS framework facilitates efficient learning and adaptation to complex patterns present in fake facial images. The evaluation of our scheme was conducted through rigorous experimentation on the dataset, employing various performance metrics. Notably, the accuracy obtained was measured at an impressive 96.7%, signifying the effectiveness of our approach in distinguishing between real and fake facial images. Additionally, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were also computed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the scheme's performance.},

  abstract={Airborne platforms and satellites provide rich sensor data in the form of hyperspectral images (HSI), which are crucial for numerous vision-related tasks, such as feature extraction, image enhancement, and data synthesis. This article reviews the contextual importance and applications of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in the advancement of HSI processing. GAI methods address the inherent challenges of HSI data, such as high dimensionality, noise, and the need to preserve spectral-spatial correlations, rendering them indispensable for modern HSI analysis. Generative neural networks, including generative adversarial networks and denoising diffusion probabilistic models, are highlighted for their superior performance in classification, segmentation, and object identification tasks, often surpassing traditional approaches, such as U-Nets, autoencoders, and deep convolutional neural networks. Diffusion models showed competitive performance in tasks, such as feature extraction and image resolution enhancement, particularly in terms of inference time and computational cost. Transformer architectures combined with attention mechanisms further improved the accuracy of generative methods, particularly for preserving spectral and spatial information in tasks, such as image translation, data augmentation, and data synthesis. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, particularly in developing computationally efficient models for super-resolution and data synthesis. In addition, novel evaluation metrics tailored to the complex nature of HSI data are needed. This review underscores the potential of GAI in addressing these challenges while presenting its current strengths, limitations, and future research directions.},

  abstract={The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Edge Intelligence (EI) introduces a groundbreaking paradigm for intelligent edge devices. With their capacity for human-like language processing and generation, LLMs empower edge computing with a powerful set of tools, paving the way for a new era of decentralized intelligence. Yet, a notable research gap exists in obtaining a thorough comprehension of LLM-based EI architectures, which should incorporate crucial elements such as security, optimization, and responsible development. This survey aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive resource for both researchers and practitioners. We explore LLM-based EI architectures in-depth, carefully analyzing state-of-the-art paradigms and design decisions. To facilitate efficient and scalable edge deployments, we perform a comparative analysis of recent optimization and autonomy techniques specifically designed for resource-constrained edge environments. Additionally, we shed light on the extensive potential of LLM-based EI by demonstrating its varied practical applications across a wide range of domains. Acknowledging the utmost importance of security, our survey thoroughly investigates potential vulnerabilities inherent in LLM-based EI deployments. We explore corresponding defense mechanisms to protect the integrity and confidentiality of data processed at the edge. In conclusion, highlighting the essential aspect of trustworthiness, we outline best practices and guiding principles for the responsible development and deployment of these systems.

  volume={43},

  pages={3072-3084},
  abstract={Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated impressive performance in medical image segmentation, particularly for low-contrast and small medical objects. However, current DRL-based segmentation methods face limitations due to the optimization of error propagation in two separate stages and the need for a significant amount of labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel deep generative adversarial reinforcement learning (DGARL) approach that, for the first time, enables end-to-end semi-supervised medical image segmentation in the DRL domain. DGARL ingeniously establishes a pipeline that integrates DRL and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to optimize both detection and segmentation tasks holistically while mutually enhancing each other. Specifically, DGARL introduces two innovative components to facilitate this integration in semi-supervised settings. First, a task-joint GAN with two discriminators links the detection results to the GAN’s segmentation performance evaluation, allowing simultaneous joint evaluation and feedback. This ensures that DRL and GAN can be directly optimized based on each other’s results. Second, a bidirectional exploration DRL integrates backward exploration and forward exploration to ensure the DRL agent explores the correct direction when forward exploration is disabled due to lack of explicit rewards. This mitigates the issue of unlabeled data being unable to provide rewards and rendering DRL unexplorable. Comprehensive experiments on three generalization datasets, comprising a total of 640 patients, demonstrate that our novel DGARL achieves 85.02% Dice and improves at least 1.91% for brain tumors, achieves 73.18% Dice and improves at least 4.28% for liver tumors, and achieves 70.85% Dice and improves at least 2.73% for pancreas compared to the ten most recent advanced methods, our results attest to the superiority of DGARL.

  abstract={Ancient buildings, as an integral part of human cultural heritage, face tilting issues that not only affect their aesthetic appeal but may also lead to structural instability or even collapse, posing serious threats to building safety and human lives. Traditional monitoring methods rely on physical sensors and manual inspections, which suffer from limitations such as data scarcity, low prediction accuracy, and poor real-time performance. To address these challenges, this study proposes a generative artificial intelligence (AI)-based tilting prediction model for ancient buildings. By leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for data augmentation, diverse combinations of tilting and contributing factor data are generated, effectively resolving the issue of data scarcity. The model adopts a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture, with inputs including contributing factors such as foundation settlement, vibration frequency, temperature, and humidity, and outputs including tilt angles and tilt rates, enabling accurate capture of complex nonlinear relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that the model significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of prediction accuracy and generalization ability, and its effectiveness is validated through a real-world monitoring system. This study provides scientific and technical support for early warning and preventive conservation of ancient building tilting, offering significant theoretical value and practical application.},

  abstract={Robot monitoring has been widely applied to observe the operation of welding robots, but the arc generated during the welding process causes severe overexposure in local areas of robot surveillance images, significantly deteriorating the monitoring effect of the welding robots. Due to the complex background structure of robot welding images, existing methods produce poor quality images after filtering out the arc from robot welding images. In this study, we propose an arc filtering model based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), primarily aimed at filtering out the arc in robot welding images. The well-trained arc filtering model can effectively eliminate the arc in robot welding images, generating high-quality non-arcing images. Experimental studies were conducted using an industrial robot welding image dataset we built autonomously and compared with state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed model.},

  abstract={The evolution of technology and science has brought groundbreaking developments to the current visual arts, and the application of digital technology has brought significant changes to the creation and aesthetic taste of traditional art. This study, therefore, investigates the current state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and applications in generating visual art while giving a brief history of the intersection of AI and art, including the milestone advancements in neural networks. Fifteen interviews were conducted with technical artists who use text-to-image AI generators to gather data. Based on the findings from the interviews, the state-of-the-art applications were reviewed and analyzed in six categories: Accessibility, Barrier to Entry, Novelty, Ethics and Morality, Control, Non-fungible tokens (NFT) and Monetization which were widely discussed along with their success and limitations. The research concludes with three main findings; (a) monetization of digital media through NFTs that has a direct impact on the advancement of art generating AI applications, (b) there is a significant change in the traditional creative process with the integration of AI applications, and AI is not just a tool but it's a creative agent that artists collaborate with (c) art generating AI applications can generate limitless possibilities within the same aesthetics as a result revolutionize the way humans create and interact with art.},

  abstract={Quantum computers are next-generation devices that hold promise to perform calculations beyond the reach of classical computers. A leading method towards achieving this goal is through quantum machine learning, especially quantum generative learning. Due to the intrinsic probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, it is reasonable to postulate that quantum generative learning models (QGLMs) may surpass their classical counterparts. As such, QGLMs are receiving growing attention from the quantum physics and computer science communities, where various QGLMs that can be efficiently implemented on near-term quantum machines with potential computational advantages are proposed. In this paper, we review the current progress of QGLMs from the perspective of machine learning. Particularly, we interpret these QGLMs, covering quantum circuit Born machines, quantum generative adversarial networks, quantum Boltzmann machines, and quantum variational autoencoders, as the quantum extension of classical generative learning models. In this context, we explore their intrinsic relations and their fundamental differences. We further summarize the potential applications of QGLMs in both conventional machine learning tasks and quantum physics. Last, we discuss the challenges and further research directions for QGLMs.},

  year={2020},

  pages={517-521},
  abstract={Single image raindrop removal is an extremely challenging task since the raindrop regions of various shapes and sizes are not given and the background information of the occluded regions is completely lost for most part. In this paper, a novel two-stage residual adaptive mask generative adversarial network (RAM-GAN) is developed for single image raindrop removal, in which the raindrop regions can be automatically detected and a restored image without raindrops is generated. Moreover, the residual adaptive mask block (RAMB) structures and residual dense adaptive mask modules (RDAMM) are proposed to be the main components constructing the network. The proposed RAMB structure can serve as a feature selector which adaptively enhances the effective information and suppress the invalid information. Each block is processed into two branches: soft mask branch and trunk branch. A mask is generated by the soft mask branch to softly weigh the features processed by the trunk branch. In addition, RDAMM, the residual densely connected module based on RAMB structure, is proposed to maximize the information flow among different blocks and guarantee better convergence. Our experimental results have demonstrated that our method can effectively remove raindrops while well preserving the image details, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively.},

  abstract={Summary <p>This chapter is the starting point in understanding the vast landscape of GenAI and its transformative capabilities. Illustrations depicting AI as robots reflect the difficulty in drawing AI software in a way everyone will instantly recognize. In a nutshell, GenAI generates outputs that appear to be original thoughts or images from a computer, rather than results produced by very advanced, contextual predictive software. GenAI delivers outputs according to the user's vision and skilled prompting. The AI is merely mimicking human behavior. Models learn human behavioral patterns along with data patterns from their training dataset. GenAI interacts through natural language and generates new content by repurposing data into new outputs. GenAI models are the subject of many news stories, water&#x2010;cooler talks, zoom meetings, and online chats. AI&#x2010;generated content still needs human curation to ensure quality and relevance.</p>},

  year={2025},

  pages={1294-1299},
  abstract={By predicting and maintaining the failures in transportation systems such as trains and large vehicles, companies can improve operational efficiency. In particular, failures in brake-related components can lead to serious accidents, making it crucial to predict such failures. However, the data collected from transportation systems is often unstable and includes missing values due to factors such as sensor failures and battery discharge. This can lead to a lack of data for future analysis and incorrect results. Although various studies have attempted to address this issue, they have not considered the characteristics and uncertainties of the attributes that significantly impact failures. Therefore, this study applies explainable artificial intelligence to the preprocessed data to classify the attributes that significantly influence failures and uses a quantum algorithm-based stochastic differential equation to model the uncertainties by reflecting attribute characteristics in the process of handling missing values. By applying quantum algorithm to estimate the final missing data, this study enhances both the completeness of the data and the accuracy of product failure identification. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, missing values in a transportation dataset are estimated in two cases: air production unit data and air pressure system data related to the brake system in transportation. Subsequently, the effectiveness of the proposed approach, as compared with other algorithms, was demonstrated.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming ophthalmology by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, optimizing treatment strategies, and expanding access to quality eye care. AI-powered machine learning and deep learning models analyze vast ophthalmic datasets, enabling the early detection of diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). These technologies improve image interpretation from fundus photography and optical coherence tomography, providing ophthalmologists with precise assessments of retinal health and disease progression. Beyond diagnostics, AI contributes to ophthalmic surgery by increasing precision in robotic-assisted procedures and enhancing preoperative planning. AI-driven teleophthalmology further reduces healthcare gaps by enabling remote screenings and consultations, particularly in low-access regions. Furthermore, AI-based automation improves clinical workflows, reducing administrative burdens and optimizing resource allocation. Despite its advantages, AI adoption in ophthalmology faces challenges, including data privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, and the need for regulatory approval. For widespread implementation, it is fundamental to ensure diverse, high-quality datasets and achieve seamless integration with existing healthcare systems. This study explores AI-driven advancements in ophthalmology, highlighting current applications, benefits, limitations, and future research directions. By leveraging AI, the field of ophthalmology is poised for a paradigm shift, improving patient outcomes and revolutionizing eye care globally.},

  abstract={In 2021, driven by the ongoing advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, previous works [1], [2] introduced architectures for fully automated blue teams in cyber defense exercises such as Locked Shields (LS). Since then, technological and scientific progress has further accelerated. In particular, the rapid evolution of generative AI through large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of cybersecurity automation. This paper reviews how cyber blue team automation can benefit from these recent advances, with a focus on how generative AI and LLMs are reshaping automation strategies for defending complex cyber infrastructure. Using the LS exercise as a case study, we discuss how generative AI-based automation can address the growing complexity of cyber threats. Our paper presents promising directions on how generative AI can enhance fully automated blue teams, and it addresses a major research gap—the lack of high-quality datasets for training and evaluation in this field. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel dataset containing labeled network traffic and end-host logs, collected during the “partners' run” preceding LS 2024. This dataset is derived from over 400 GB of captured network traffic and more than 6 million log entries. It captures real-world red team behavior and is made publicly available to foster research and AI development in the field of blue team automation.

Traditional model-based methods cannot fully satisfy the analysis and control requirements of modern power systems duo to its complexity and uncertainty. At the same time, with the deployment of smart meters and advanced sensors, an unprecedented amount of data is generated by the power systems all the time. The generated data have great value and can make up for the deficiency of the traditional physical model based approaches.

  title={MGDefect: A Mask-Guided High-Quality Defect Image Generation Method for Improving Defect Inspection}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-14},
  abstract={Deep learning based defect inspection methods have achieved promising performance, which usually relies on a large number of well-labeled training samples. However, it requires much effort to obtain enough annotated samples especially pixel-level annotations in practical production. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be utilized to generate defect samples. However, training GANs typically requires a large amount of defect data and most of them cannot generate defect samples with pixel-level annotations. In this paper, we present a Mask-Guided Defect image generation method, called MGDefect, which can generate high-quality defect samples with pixel-level annotations and effectively improves the performance of downstream tasks. Specifically, MGDefect consists of a Mask-Guided Defect Generation GAN (MGDG-GAN) and a Defect Mask GAN (DM-GAN). MGDG-GAN generates images containing defects with specific locations, shapes, and sizes via mask guidance and the dual discrimination for defects at the region level and image level. DM-GAN aims to generate diverse and rational masks for MGDG-GAN. It also adopts region-level and image-level dual discrimination for masks to generate compatible masks with the target objects. MGDG-GAN mainly focuses on generating local defect regions and DM-GAN specializes in generating masks, which are both trained on limited defect samples and abundant normal samples. Experiments conducted on the MVTec AD, DAGM 2007, and KolektorSDD2 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves promising results compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. Meanwhile, the generated defect samples significantly improve the performance of defect inspection tasks including classification and segmentation. Specifically, our method achieves KID$\times 10^{3}$/IS scores of 48.35/2.27 on MVTec AD, 15.37/2.44 on DAGM 2007, and 19.70/2.01 on KolektorSDD2. Furthermore, our method improves mIoU by 10.59%, 2.20%, and 2.17% on these datasets, respectively, using U-Net as the segmentation model.},

  title={CNN-Based Metrics for Performance Evaluation of Generative Adversarial Networks}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={5},
  number={10},
  pages={5040-5049},
  abstract={In this work, we propose two convolutional neural network (CNN) based metrics, classification score (CS) and distribution score (DS), for performance evaluation of generative adversarial networks (GANs). Though GAN-generated images can be evaluated through manual assessment of visual fidelity, it is prolonged, subjective, challenging, tiresome, and can be misleading. Existing quantitative methods are biased toward memory GAN and fail to detect overfitting. CS and DS allow us to experimentally prove that training of GANs is actually guided by the dataset that it improves with every epoch and gets closer to following the distribution of the dataset. Both methods are based on GAN-generated image classification by CNN. CS is the root mean square (rms) value of three different classification techniques, direct classification (DC), indirect classification (IC), and blind classification (BC). It exhibits the degree to which GAN can learn the features and generate fake images similar to real datasets. DS shows the contrast between the mean distribution of GAN-generated data and the real data. It indicates the extent to which GANs can create synthetic images with similar distribution to real datasets. We evaluated CS and DS metrics for different variants of GANs and compared their performances with existing metrics. Results show that CS and DS can evaluate the different variants of GANs quantitatively and qualitatively while detecting overfitting and mode collapse.},

  abstract={Edge intelligence is a new technical framework that seeks to unify Artificial Intelligence (AI), mobile edge computing, and communications networks. It is widely recognized as one of the most important missing pieces of the present 5G network, and it projected to be one of the most aspects to next-generation 6G edge-AI. This article provides a self-learning infrastructure centered on self-supervised generative adversarial networks to illustrate how automated data synthesis and learning at the networking edge might boost performance. Our 5G-connected campus shuttle system serves as a test bed for our planned self-learning architecture. The results we obtained show that the suggested architecture may successfully identify and categorize novel services in edge computing settings.},

  pages={184-189},
  abstract={While AI has many advantages, it also has a few drawbacks associated with “deep fakes.” Deep fakes involve the creation of very realistic videos and images realized through technologies that work with facial and voice modalities for deceptive purposes. Researchers have developed various techniques to detect these manipulated videos and images, employing complex neural network models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, deep fakes are very difficult to identify due to lighting and shadow effects that may hide some signs of manipulation. No one technique of detection could have the ability of identifying the tampered images under all kinds of illumination conditions. This paper compares different CNN models-ResNet50, EfficientNet, and MobileNetV2-to improve detection accuracy so as to be more resistant to new deep fake techniques, in particular under different illumination conditions. The importance of the study lies in arriving at which of the considered CNN models turns out to be most accurate under a specific illumination effect. Such an understanding could, therefore, improve the results of detection even when applied to cases of tampered faces in fake Aadhaar detection and fake id detection, thereby clearly bringing out the usefulness of the research in practice.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={526-530},
  abstract={This study explores the impact of perceived risk and trust on the willingness of journalists to use generative AI (GenAl) technology. As AI evolves, its applications in journalism, such as automated news writing and personalized content recommendations, have grown significantly. However, the adoption of GenAl by journalists is influenced by various factors, with perceived risk and trust being paramount. Perceived risk encompasses the uncertainties and potential negative outcomes associated with using the technology, while trust pertains to the confidence in the technology's reliability, security, and effectiveness. This research aims to fill the gap in empirical studies on these factors by constructing a theoretical model based on risk perception and trust theories. The study employs a detailed survey, validated through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), to measure journalists' perceived risks, trust, and their willingness to use GenAl. Findings from this research are expected to offer valuable insights for the journalism industry, providing strategies to mitigate perceived risks and enhance trust, thereby promoting broader adoption of GenAl. Additionally, the results will contribute to the theoretical understanding of technology adoption in journalism and other professional domains.},

  pages={920-926},
  abstract={The process of visual inspection has been significantly improved with addition of AI with human in the loop. In this paper, we introduce new features to enhance our end–to‒end visual inspection framework for HBMs. We detect individual HBMs consisting of multiple components along with providing a full report for the scanned chip providing 3D metrology information, details on defects and possible root cause analysis for the defects. Our modular approach can integrate any object detection and segmentation deep learning model based on the inspection requirements. We introduce a multi-view approach to increase the robustness of the detection and identification framework for defective bumps. Our approach can directly process high-resolution 3D scans and generate automatically an inspection report from our generative AI model. On our HBM dataset, the defective bump identification increased by 46%. We also conduct a study on learning with less labels. With varied percentages of labeled data, we achieved segmentation accuracy of 87% on memory bumps respectively with only utilizing 25% labelled bumps for training our AI models. The Inspection reports are customized using our 3D Metrology toolbox and Large Language Models (LLMs) providing possible causes and suggestions. We then propose a fully automated system, that with one click is able to provide a comprehensive report of the entire dense 3D scan consisting of more than 400 bumps in under 5 minutes. This system shows immense promise to expedite the inspection process and ultimately be used for inline inspection with 3D scanners.},

  year={2024},
  volume={11},
  number={6},
  pages={7929-7940},
  abstract={The quality of the dataset is critical to the performance of neural networks for error prediction in 3-D printing. In order to enlarge the dataset, we propose a customized two-stage framework, cascaded cross-modality generative adversarial networks (CCMGANs), for generating dental crown meshes in an unsupervised manner. At the first stage, a displacement map-guided generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to generate coarse meshes with diverse shapes. At the second stage, fine-grained details are added to the coarse meshes using an image-based GAN. Unlike previous work that integrates a differentiable renderer into the mesh deformation process directly, we adopt a two-step strategy. First, we use a depth image refinement module to achieve the domain transformation from the rendered depth images of the generated meshes to those of the real ones. Then, we propose a mesh refinement module to optimize the coarse meshes in an image-supervised manner. To alleviate the self-intersection problem, we propose a loss to penalize the distances of point pairs in self-intersection regions. Experimental results show that our method is able to generate highly realistic meshes and outperforms the state-of-the-art point cloud generation method TreeGCN in terms of the metrics FDD, MMD-CD, MMD-EMD, and COV-EMD. Furthermore, we utilize the generated data to augment the original dataset, and demonstrate that the generated data can effectively improve the accuracy of the error prediction task in 3-D printing.},

  year={2023},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Semi-supervised learning presents a challenge in preparing a classifier in a dataset that has few marked and many unlabelled models. The GAN architecture is expanded by the semi-supervised GAN model, which involves preparing a managed discriminator, an unaided discriminator, and a generator model simultaneously. The result is a managed grouping model that effectively sums up hidden models and a generator model that produces possible instances of pictures from the domain. The aim of research is to study semi-supervised learning problems using GANs for regression. The goal of reverse engineering is to predict the continuum of data given rather than simply splitting the work into a small number of different categories. In the case of autonomous driving, for example, it is very expensive to obtain a sufficient number of written standards covering all driving. In this particular case, we can use the semi-supervised learning method together with the basic structure design, such as the creation of negative networks. The proposed GAN-based semi-supervised writing strategies are centered around addressing the characterization issue. The problem of developing a semi-supervised method using GAN for regression tasks is still unresolved. Reg-GAN has been presented in two different architectures to address this issue.},

  abstract={The prediction of the pore structure of rock formations is of critical importance for the comprehension of fluid flow and storage capacity in underground reservoirs. The conventional techniques frequently encounter difficulties in addressing the intricacy and variability of pore distribution. In this work, we put forward a novel GAN framework that has been designed with the specific purpose of predicting pore structures. The framework comprises a generator that generates images of pore structures incorporating authentic geological characteristics through a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), while simultaneously performing feature extraction on the input geological data. The discriminator employs the adversarial training strategy, which enables the differentiation and assessment of generated samples and real samples through the convolutional layer. The minimised adversarial loss function is utilised to enhance the authenticity of the generated samples. The model was trained on multiple geological sample datasets, combining different pore characteristics and spatial distribution information, in order to ensure its generalisability and accuracy. The results of the experimental analysis demonstrate that our GAN-based method is markedly more effective than the traditional prediction model, exhibiting enhanced accuracy and reliability in capturing the spatial distribution of pore structures.},

  number={},
  pages={395-401},
  abstract={In this paper, we introduce a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model designed to reconstruct images of artistic Arabic calligraphy characters. One of the major challenges in this field is the limited availability of datasets containing artistic Arabic calligraphy that are written with calligraphy pens and adhering traditional artistic rules, making it difficult to develop models that accurately capture the unique visual and structural intricacies of the script. To address this issue, we propose a method to compress the vector representation from $28 \times 28$ pixel images in the input layer to a 26-dimensional latent space while leveraging two newly developed artistic Arabic calligraphy datasets. Various VAE configuration parameters were tested to enhance reconstruction efficiency. The training phase utilized the publicly available Arabic Handwritten Character Dataset (AHCD) and the two new datasets in the Naskh and Reqaa styles, created using specialized calligraphy pens. During testing, these datasets were evaluated individually and in combination, with the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for each reconstruction experiment recorded. The average reconstruction MSE values were 0.0532, 0.0405, and 0.0289 for the Naskh, Reqaa, and combined datasets, respectively. Our results demonstrate the significance of dataset type in the quality of reconstructed artistic calligraphy and suggest future improvements through larger, more diverse datasets.},

  abstract={There is huge potential for artificial intelligence (AI)-driven attacks on Internet of Things (IoT) networks, particularly with the growing use of generative AI (GenAI) and regenerative AI (RGenAI). GenAIs are known for generating new datasets with similar attributes to their underlying trained datasets, while RGenAIs can reshape and adapt the inputs feeding GenAIs based on feedback responses. These AI technologies, when combined, can inflict massive costs on IoT networks that may be difficult to detect and resolve. In this paper, a contextual model is proposed to examine the possible scenarios of IoT network attacks arising from the combination of GenAI/RGenAI entities. This model constructs potential AIdriven attacks on IoT ecosystems as a looped process occurring in three phases: learn, deploy, and adapt. The paper further considers the likely use cases of this proposed model and provides insights into possible countermeasures to prevent such AI attacks.},

  pages={444-451},
  abstract={The problem of data imbalance is defined as the uneven distribution of the training examples to the existing classes of a dataset. Among a wide variety of solutions, the oversampling techniques try to mitigate the problem by synthesizing artificial examples associated with the minority class. The huge success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) rendered them an attractive choice for oversampling and numerous researchers proposed modifications of GANs for imbalanced datasets. Nevertheless, the existing models employ the entire minority class for sample generation, thus being vulnerable to outliers and noisy data instances. In addition, the majority of the relevant research concerns image classification tasks, leaving a large gap for research with tabular data. Finally, another powerful and popular generative model, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has been rather overlooked by the community in class imbalance solutions. In this paper we present SB-GAN and SB-VAE, two generative models that identify borderline and noisy samples before they are trained. In this manner SB-GAN and SB-VAE learn better class distributions that are not distorted by the existence of outliers. The experimental evaluation of SB-GAN and SB-VAE with 4 tabular datasets revealed a superior performance against 8 state-of-the-art oversampling techniques.},

A form of exploitation is to turn these technologies, intended for good, to become dual-purposed instruments to support deviant acts like malicious software trojans. As part of proactive defense, researchers are proactively identifying such vulnerabilities so that protective measures could be developed subsequently. This research explores a novel blackbox trojanising approach using a simple network structure modification to any deep learning image classification model that would transform a benign model into a deviant one with a simple manipulation of the weights to induce specific types of errors. Propositions to protect the occurrence of such simple exploits are discussed in this research.

The system is implemented using a hybrid ensemble of InceptionV3 and ConvNeXtTiny models, trained on a heterogeneous data set of 30 medicinal plants in order to provide secure and reliable classification.To recommend appropriate treatments, a collaborative filtering approach is used to compare the identified plant to Ayurvedic treatments in a structured CSV database.

  abstract={Crowd flow generation, which aims to simulate the flows of crowd in the future is of great importance to many real-life applications including epidemic spreading and traffic management. The challenges of accurate crowd flow generation come from both the complex spatial-temporal correlations of crowd flow data and the small amount of training data, which is largely not well studied and addressed in existing works. In this paper, we propose a novel attentive dual-head spatial-temporal generative adversarial network entitled ADST-GAN to simulate multi-step crowd flow. To augment the learning power of the generator, we adopt attentive temporal queue and self attention mechanism to automatically capture the complex global spatial-temporal dependencies of crowd flow data. As for the discriminator, we design a dual-head architecture with two-objective training to avoid the negative effects of quick overfitting. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments over the bike and taxi trip datasets in New York. The results demonstrate the proposed method outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines significantly in terms of the quality of simulated crowd flow data.},

Relevant works have already been conducted using information uncertainty to select valuable samples. However, its effectiveness for semantic segmentation tasks is relatively poor. In this paper, we propose an active learning framework based on the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) architecture for semantic segmentation task, which achieves efficient data selection while simultaneously enhancing semantic segmentation performance. The proposed framework combines the generator (i.e., semantic segmentation network) and the discriminator (i.e., data selection network) for jointly optimizing of both semantic segmentation and data selection tasks. Extensive experiments were conducted on the dataset, which was collected from real-world autonomous driving scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieved competitive results compared to other SOTA methods.},

  abstract={Anomalies in time series data contain valuable information for engineers, scientists and entrepreneurs. However, the anomaly detection in time series is facing with the complexity caused by the large volume and high dimensions of data. To mitigate the problem, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection method for time series data based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) with the long-short term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNN) as base modules. The nature of generative models is used to capture the distributions of high dimensional data, where the LSTM module is used to learn the temporal relationships. The proposed framework is designed with the capability to reconstruct input data after training, and the reconstruction errors based anomaly scores are assigned to each time step in the time series, which determines the anomalies. Experimental results show the superiorities and efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Packet loss is one of the top reasons for speech quality degradation in Voice over IP calls. Packet loss concealment (PLC) is a technique of facing packet loss. This article describes a system based on a deep neural network (DNN) and pre-trained frequency-consistent generative adversarial network (Fre-GAN), which aims to heal audio impairments caused by packet losses, thus impairing the quality of the audio playout. We use the sliding window method to simulate real-time audio processing and extract features within the window, a multi-layer fully connected network is applied to predict the mel-spectrogram of missing audio packets based on the context within the window, and a frequency- consistent generative adversarial network is used to convert the mel-spectrogram to a waveform and backfill it to the part of the dropped frame. We name this system PLCfre-GAN. In the 2022 INTERSPEECH Audio Deep PLC Challenge, we applied PLCfre- GAN to mitigate artificially simulated audio impairments. The processed audio we submitted surpasses the challenge zero- padding baseline and ranks the top 5 with a PLC-MOS score on the blind test dataset of 3.478. Compared with previous machine learning methods, the proposed system has shown a considerable improvement in the scores of several evaluation metrics, and the recognition accuracy of synthesized speech is also guaranteed even in the case of frequent loss.},

  abstract={In response to the difficulty of obtaining a large number of fault data samples in practical engineering applications, as well as the problem of low fault detection accuracy under small sample conditions, a bearing fault diagnosis method based on one-dimensional deep convolutional generative adversarial networks is proposed. According to the sample data of bearing vibration signals, a one-dimensional deep convolutional generative adversarial network is used to supplement the samples to enrich the fault information. Then, the processed one-dimensional time series signals are transformed into two-dimensional feature signals using Gramian Angular Field and input into the AlexNet network to achieve accurate classification of different fault types. Validation is conducted using rolling bearing data from Case Western Reserve University, and experimental results show that under small sample conditions, accurate classification can be achieved for various fault types. Compared with some existing advanced methods, it has a higher fault classification accuracy and stronger generalization performance.},

  abstract={In our recent study, we introduced a novel convolution method, called GConv, which improves the performance of generative adversarial networks (GAN) by modulating the convolution kernels following the given latent vector. In this paper, we analyze the limitations of GConv, and propose an improved GConv to address those problems. While GConv modulates the convolution kernel equally at all pixels, the proposed method produces pixel-wise different kernels following not only the given latent vector but also the feature in each pixel. Even though the proposed method is a simple modification of GConv, it shows better performance compared to the standard convolution as well as GConv. To show the superiority of the proposed method, this paper provides experimental results on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Quantitative evaluations reveal that the proposed method improves both GAN and conditional GAN (cGAN) performance in terms of Frechet inception distance (FID).},

Nevertheless, regulation around AI wellness applications is entirely unregulated, while ChatGPT has serious shortcomings regarding mental health counseling. Future directions should focus on developing niche language models as well as strict ethical and clinical validations.

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in general, and large language models (LLMs) in particular, are highly fashionable. As they have the ability to generate coherent output based on prompts in natural language, they are promoted as tools to free knowledge workers from tedious tasks such as content writing, customer support and routine computer code generation. Unsurprisingly, their application is also attractive to professionals in the research domain, where mundane and laborious tasks, such as literature screening, are commonplace. We evaluate Vertex AI ‘text-bison’, a foundational LLM model, in a real-world academic scenario by replicating parts of a popular systematic review in the information management domain. By comparing the results of a zero-shot LLM-based approach with those of the original study, we gather evidence on the suitability of state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs for the analysis of scientific content. We show that the LLM-based approach delivers good scientific content analysis performance for a general classification problem (ACC =0.9), acceptable performance for a domain-specific classification problem (ACC =0.8) and borderline performance for a text comprehension problem (ACC ≈0.69). We conclude that some content analysis tasks with moderate accuracy requirements may be supported by current LLMs. As the technology will evolve rapidly in the foreseeable future, studies on large corpora, where some inaccuracies are tolerable, or workflows that prepare large data sets for human processing, may increasingly benefit from the capabilities of GenAI.},

  abstract={The recent advances in Generative Artificial In-telligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated significant interest across the world. For a successful adoption of GenAI and LLMs by industry, it is critical to identify their potential benefits, impact, and challenges. Accordingly, in this work, we investigate a few use cases of LLMs, which are relevant across most industry segments. In order to empirically evaluate the impact of GenAI on the code generation use case, we build CodePrompt, a handcrafted dataset of sequential prompts used by a human user to generate code. We approximate efficiency by considering the ratio of the number of tokens of code generated by an LLM to the number of tokens in the user's prompt. Experimental results reveal that a sequential trial of prompts for code generation may lead to an efficiency factor of about 6.33, on average, which means that a user's effort is reduced to about one-sixth.},

With the advent of generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI), data conversion has been revolutionized, significantly reducing manual intervention. Traditional methods, often labor-intensive and costly, are replaced by automated Gen AI solutions. This innovation not only reduces technical effort and business involvement but also accelerates project timelines and lowers costs. This article explores the implementation of a Gen AI-driven solution that automates data extraction, validation, and mapping, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. Utilizing advanced technologies, such as SQL, Python pandas, and PyTorch, this approach reimagines the workflow, enabling faster and more reliable ERP implementations with minimal disruption. By harnessing the power of machine learning and neural networks, the system evolves continuously, offering a scalable and robust solution for modern enterprises navigating the complexities of digital transformation.

  pages={157712-157729},
  abstract={With the growing popularity of generative AI for images, video, and music, we witnessed models rapidly improve in quality and performance. However, not much attention is paid towards enabling AI’s ability to “be creative”. We often attribute the quality of “being creative” to an individual or an object, but we believe that countless variables participate in determining what or who is creative, transcending a single entity or artifact. Csikszentmihalyi’s systems model of creativity suggests that creativity is a product of interactions among multiple parts of a society that create, evaluate, and record. In this study, we implemented and simulated Csikszentmihalyi’s systems model of creativity using virtual agents utilizing large language models (LLMs) and text prompts. We conducted experiments in virtual settings where creativity is achieved with the presence of specific characteristics in the artifact. For comparison, the simulations were conducted with two “virtual artists” being 1)in the system, which received feedback from the field, and 2)isolated, which did not. Both agents were compared by analyzing the novelty, which was measured via Creativity Implication Network, and value, quantified through the desired characteristics present in artifacts. Our results suggest that the agents that receive feedback from the field can generate artifacts that are more novel and more valuable, thus more creative, in the framework of the systems model of creativity. Furthermore, the difference becomes more evident when external factors enact changes to the domain.},

  abstract={The integration of federated learning (FL) with the Internet of Things (IoT) represents an advanced technological trend, combining the extensive connectivity of IoT with the powerful processing capabilities of FL to drive innovation and optimization across multiple domains. Given the heterogeneity of IoT devices and the variability in data distribution, developing strategies to enhance FL performance without overly burdening resource-constrained devices is crucial. This article proposes an FL algorithm based on generative artificial intelligence (GAI) for IoT devices with extreme heterogeneity in data and resources. The algorithm utilizes pretrained GAI models to generate new data, aligning the data distributions of individual IoT devices closer to independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), thereby effectively reducing the heterogeneity of local data. Additionally, the proposed algorithm incorporates data synthesis and resource scheduling strategies to mitigate the heterogeneity of local device resources. Finally, we formulate a joint optimization problem aimed at minimizing total energy consumption while maximizing FL performance. Experimental results demonstrate that, under significant resource and data distribution disparities, most existing solutions struggle to converge, whereas the proposed method converges and achieves superior performance. Compared to existing GAI-based approaches, our method significantly reduces latency and energy consumption.},

However, EI faces various challenges due to resource constraints, heterogeneous network environments, and diverse service requirements of different applications, which together affect the trustworthiness of EI in the eyes of stakeholders. This survey comprehensively summarizes the characteristics, architecture, technologies, and solutions of trustworthy EI. Specifically, we first emphasize the need for trustworthy EI in the context of the trend toward large models. We then provide an initial definition of trustworthy EI, explore its key characteristics and give a multi-layered architecture for trustworthy EI. Then, we present enabling technologies for trustworthy EI systems. Subsequently, we summarize several important issues that hinder the achievement of trustworthy EI and provide an in-depth literature review of the state-of-the-art solutions for realizing the trustworthiness of EI.

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have risen to prominence due to their unparalleled ability to craft and generate digital assets, encompassing text, images, audio, video, and 3D models. Leveraging the capabilities of diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion and Instruct pix2pix, users can guide AI with specific prompts, streamlining the creative journey for graphic designers. However, the primary application of these models has been to graphic content within desktop interfaces, prompting professionals in interior and architectural design to seek more tailored solutions for their daily operations. To bridge this gap, Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) technologies offer a promising solution, transforming traditional 2D artworks into engaging 3D interactive realms. In this paper, we present "Dream Mesh," a MR application MR tool that combines a Speech-to-3D generative workflow besed on DreamFusion model without relying on pre-existing 3D content libraries.

  abstract={Fundus images play a crucial role in diagnosing ocular and systemic vascular diseases in clinical settings. However, these images often suffer from issues like uneven brightness and transmission distortion, which adversely impact their quality. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach called the Probability Conditional Guidance Generative Adversarial Network (PCGGAN). This method leverages the high-frequency components of the images to enhance their quality. The hypothesis behind this approach is that retaining the content and pathological information associated with the high-frequency components is vital during the enhancement process. To achieve this, the fundus image is decomposed into high-frequency and low-frequency components, with the high-frequency components probabilistically used as conditional guidance during model training. This training strategy enables the model to learn the distinctions between unconditional and conditional constraints, thereby enhancing its capability for targeted generation and generalization. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through both quantitative and qualitative experiments.},

  abstract={The music industry has seen significant growth in recent years. This growth can be attributed to a high demand of new music; music streaming apps such as Spotify, Soundcloud, Apple Music, etc. which help people discover artists and bands from all over the world; growth in the film industry which uses music in the form of sound effects and soundtracks to set the tone and help the audience feel a range of emotions; and increase in usage of social media apps such as Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch etc. To meet this surge in the demand of music, music needs to be composed. Composing music is a complex task which involves taking into consideration harmony, rhythm, texture, and structure. This paper aims to shed light on the various ways music can be composed using artificial intelligence. We look at different architectures of neural networks such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs), Autoencoders, General Adversarial Networks (GANs) and transformers to understand which architecture contributes substantially to the process of composition. We also examine the different datasets used to see how the dataset that a model is trained on affects the composition capabilities of a model as well as different evaluation metrics that can be used to evaluate the composed music.},

  abstract={With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is becoming increasingly important in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). At the same time, large language models (LLMs) and generative AI (GenAI) are gradually playing significant roles in the IoV. Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) are models capable of integrating multiple modalities of information, enhancing the environmental perception capabilities of the IoV. GenAI can generate highly complex virtual driving scenarios, which are used to test and optimize intelligent driving algorithms, reducing the risks and costs of real-world road testing. Embodied AI can interact with the environment and make decisions, and can learn in the simulated environments that are provided by GenAI. To address issues like low correlation of multimodal data, high-uncertainty of driving environment, and insufficient intelligence in the IoV, this article proposes a perception and decision-making system empowered by embodied AI. First, we utilize a transformer to achieve multimodal data fusion integrated with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) data. Second, the MLLM analyzes the situation based on driving intentions, communication conditions, and the perceived environmental expressions. Finally, the MLLM makes the optimal decisions and adjustments based on the analysis. The experimental results show that the integration of V2V enables the IoV to more comprehensively perceive a complex driving environment. The MLLM can empower the IoV to make accurate decisions in high-uncertainty scenarios, significantly improving route completion rates.},

This study aims to apply concepts of Human-centered AI in practice-based research on ESAP teaching material creation in the discipline of mathematics. The procedure includes the establishment of a Human-AI Interaction framework in terms of its content and procedure, and based on the specific AI generations, ethical and performance values are discussed by the interdisciplinary team of EAP and math teachers. It is found that the Human-AI Interaction procedure of setting goals, issuing instructions, analyzing feedback, and adjusting strategies support AI augmentation in terms of teaching objectives and teaching materials, and the application of compounded cross-disciplinary pedagogical theories and practice in the human-AI interaction amplifies human intelligence to the context of a new disciplinary area.

  abstract={The use of biomedical images for the training of various Deep Learning (DL) systems oriented to health has reported a competitive performance. However, DL needs a large number of images for a correct generalization and, particularly in the case of biomedical images, these can be scarce. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as Data Augmenting tools have reaped significant results to improve performance in tasks that involve the use of this kind of image. However, the architectural design of these generative models in the biomedical image area has been usually relegated to the expertise of researchers. Moreover, GANs are affected by training instability that may lead to poor quality results. This paper presents a neuroevolution algorithm based on Particle Swarm Optimization for the design and training of GANs for the generation of biomedical Chest X-Ray (CXR) images of pneumonia caused by COVID-19. The proposed approach allows having a swarm of GANs topologies, where each one of them grows progressively while being trained at the same time. The fitness value is based on the Frechet Inception Distance (FID). The proposed algorithm is able to obtain better FID results compared to handcrafted GANs for the synthesis of CXR images.},

  abstract={Spectrum management and resource allocation (RA) problems are challenging and critical in a vast number of research areas such as wireless communications and computer networks. The traditional approaches for solving such problems usually consume time and memory, especially for large-size problems. Recently different machine learning approaches have been considered as potential promising techniques for combinatorial optimization problems, especially the generative model of the deep neural networks. In this work, we propose a resource allocation deep autoencoder network, as one of the promising generative models, for enabling spectrum sharing in underlay device-to-device (D2D) communication by solving linear sum assignment problems (LSAPs). Specifically, we investigate the performance of three different architectures for the conditional variational autoencoders (CVAE). The three proposed architecture are the convolutional neural network (CVAE-CNN) autoencoder, the feed-forward neural network (CVAE-FNN) autoencoder, and the hybrid (H-CVAE) autoencoder. The simulation results show that the proposed approach could be used as a replacement of the conventional RA techniques, such as the Hungarian algorithm, due to its ability to find solutions of LASPs of different sizes with high accuracy and very fast execution time. Moreover, the simulation results reveal that the accuracy of the proposed hybrid autoencoder architecture outperforms the other proposed architectures and the state-of-the-art DNN techniques.},

  abstract={This study delves into a comprehensive analysis and identification of potential vocal cues influencing the perception of authenticity versus artificiality in speech. Our primary aim is to pinpoint the pivotal parameters distinguishing genuine voices from artificially synthesized ones. Employing a multifaceted approach, we leverage advanced methodologies encompassing spectral analysis of speech signals, discernment of prosodic patterns, and the application of cutting-edge machine learning techniques such as Hifi-GAN and generative AI. By examining voice data sourced from diverse origins, our aim is to uncover pivotal markers that impact the perception of truthfulness or artificiality in voices, ultimately constructing a predictive model capable of reliably distinguishing between authentic and artificially crafted voices across both pathological and non-pathological conditions. The culmination of this research holds significant implications not only for advancing the scientific and technological understanding of human voice distinctiveness but also for practical applications in healthcare and security domains. Indeed, in the healthcare field the ability to discern authentic voices from artificial ones could facilitate more accurate diagnosis and monitoring of conditions affecting speech, such as neurodegenerative diseases or vocal cord disorders. Additionally, in security contexts, this research could enhance the reliability of voice-based authentication systems, thereby bolstering the integrity of sensitive communications and data transmission. This could pave the way for advancements in security protocols, healthcare applications, and bolstering the reliability of voice-based technologies.},

  abstract={Multispectral image matching is at the base for many remote sensing and computer vision applications. Due to the different imaging principles and spectra, there are significant nonlinear variations in intensity, texture, and style in multispectral images. This makes it difficult for many classic methods designed for the images of the same spectrum to achieve satisfactory matching performance. To cope with this problem, this letter proposes a new method based on image transfer and local feature for multispectral image matching. First, we propose a new regularized conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) for image transfer to preprocess the multispectral images. This step eliminates the differences in grayscale, texture, and style between the multispectral images. Then, we use a classic local feature to match the generated and original images. We evaluate our method on two commonly used data sets and compare with several state-of-the-art methods. The experiments show that our method performs well by significantly improving the matching accuracy and robustness, and slightly increasing the runtime.},

  pages={1232-1237},
  abstract={Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) aims to transfer the knowledge from a large teacher network to a lightweight student network without accessing the original training data. However, existing DFKD methods face the issue of distribution shift during data synthesis, which leads to a decline in knowledge distillation. To address this issue, we propose a data-free knowledge distillation method (CCD) based on contrastive inversion (CI) and cluster alignment (CA). Specifically, CI enables the generative network to better capture relevant features and efficiently synthesize images that conforms to the original training data. However, using CI alone can severely reduce the diversity of synthesis images, which may lead to poor performance of the student network. Thus, we propose CA to assure the generative network can learn not only intra-class feature but also the inter-class feature to alleviate the diversity issue. The experiments on various dataset show that our proposed method outperform other baseline methods.},

  abstract={The rapid development of generative AI has attracted significant attention in education. This study uses Q methodology to explore educators' views on AI's impact across five key dimensions: educational theory, learning outcomes, educational technology, educational ethics, and pedagogy. The analysis identifies three educator groups: (1) Education Stalwarts Emphasizing Humanistic Care (F1), who prioritize values like critical thinking, self-motivation, and social responsibility; (2) Education Reformers Advocating Technological Integration (F2), who support AI-driven innovations; and (3) Education Explorers Focused on Learning Experiences (F3), who emphasize personalized, technology-enhanced learning. Although perspectives on AI integration vary, there is agreement that education should promote human progress and personal growth. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse by advocating for a balanced approach that integrates tradition with innovation to enhance educational outcomes.},

  abstract={For over two decades, search engines have played a critical role in the internet ecosystem, facilitating access to vast amounts of information. Google, Bing, and other search engines have become household names, ingrained in the way people navigate the web and retrieve data. However, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in generative AI models like OpenAI's GPT-4, have ushered in a new era of information retrieval. These models offer a fundamentally different approach by generating context-aware, human-like responses to complex queries, effectively challenging the search engine's dominance. This paper explores the transition from traditional search engine-based information retrieval to generative AI models, discussing the limitations of search engines, the strengths of generative AI, the societal and economic implications of this shift, and the ethical considerations that accompany the growing reliance on AI for information dissemination. The research draws on historical trends, technological advancements, and contemporary user behavior to present a comprehensive analysis of how generative AI is reshaping the digital landscape.},

  abstract={High-resolution aerial imaging is crucial in the field of military applications for gathering intelligence and devising strategic plans. This research examines super-resolution approaches, with a specific emphasis on three Deep Learning Neural Models: Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (SRCNN), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN). The study does a rigorous comparison investigation of these models, with the goal of determining their effectiveness in producing high-resolution aerial photographs. In order to conduct a thorough evaluation of these models, a wide range of datasets is utilised, which includes MNIST, Fashion MNIST, DIV2K, and DOTA. This extensive range of options enables a comprehensive evaluation of the models' performance across a wide range of data complexities, ranging from simple geometric forms to complicated real-world aerial landscapes. This research offers detailed analysis of the datasets, allowing for a thorough examination of the strengths and shortcomings of the models. It provides valuable insights into how these models might be applied to real-world military situations. The results of this study have important consequences for military intelligence. Efficiently generating super-resolved aerial images can improve target recognition, terrain analysis, and threat assessment. Furthermore, comprehending the relative strengths of various models enables military agencies to customise their image processing approaches to meet unique operational needs. This research facilitates the integration of modern deep learning techniques with the complexities of military intelligence, thereby enabling better informed decision-making processes and eventually strengthening national security operations.},

  abstract={Large language models as part of artificial intelligence technologies have been rapidly developed in recent years. It become possible thanks to models based on neural networks and generative learning methods. GPT-based systems have become an integral part of many social and economic sectors. Education, including higher education, has also not been left out of the world of large language models. These models provide not only new opportunities, but also risks for the education system. This paper examines various aspects of the application of large language models for higher education. The results of a survey of learners and teachers on how they apply these new technologies in their activities are presented. One of the main problem of large language models usage is the high level of learners' usage of them and low level of teachers' usage of the technique. Another problem is irresponsible usage of artificial intelligence methods by students.},

  pages={130159-130171},
  abstract={To learn disentangled representations of facial images, we present a Dual Encoder-Decoder based Generative Adversarial Network (DED-GAN). In the proposed method, both the generator and discriminator are designed with deep encoder-decoder architectures as their backbones. To be more specific, the encoder-decoder structured generator is used to learn a pose disentangled face representation, and the encoder-decoder structured discriminator is tasked to perform real/fake classification, face reconstruction, determining identity and estimating face pose. We further improve the proposed network architecture by minimizing the additional pixel-wise loss defined by the Wasserstein distance at the output of the discriminator so that the adversarial framework can be better trained. Additionally, we consider face pose variation to be continuous, rather than discrete in existing literature, to inject richer pose information into our model. The pose estimation task is formulated as a regression problem, which helps to disentangle identity information from pose variations. The proposed network is evaluated on the tasks of pose-invariant face recognition (PIFR) and face synthesis across poses. An extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation carried out on several controlled and in-the-wild benchmarking datasets demonstrates the superiority of the proposed DED-GAN method over the state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence tools are capturing the attention of the public and business since the introduction of ChatGPT. While this technology offers many productivity tools, their accessibility to screen reader users is little studied. Most of the technical and professional communication research about these tools focuses on their applied potential. This paper reports the findings of a mixed methods study on the user interfaces of three websites on which GenAI tools reside and the accessibility of their web editors. Studying the accessibility of these firms’ websites and their builder platforms is important because without accessibility features, blind customers cannot access these tools and create websites. This study found that none of the three builder websites, or the web editors for their tools, had WCAG 2.1 level AA accessibility. To improve these tools’ accessibility and usability, these website builders will need to invest resources to develop accessibility knowhow on web development and AI. Involvement of disabled users as co-designers and testers is essential to ensure accessibility in this AI infrastructure. This paper contributes 21 best practices for designing accessible interfaces for generative AI tools.},

  abstract={This paper presents two pedagogical approaches for teaching in the era of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), using case studies from mathematics and computer science. As Generation Z and Alpha have grown up immersed in technology, their learning styles differ significantly from previous generations, creating challenges for traditional instructional methods. While digital platforms provide flexibility, accessibility, and interactivity, the rapid advancement of generative AI adds new layers of complexity. These AI tools enhance self-learning and problem-solving but also raise concerns about ethical usage and conceptual depth. Building on existing research, we introduce two methods: one based on a “learning how to learn” approach in mathematics, which emphasizes mathematical reasoning and problem interpretation over procedural mastery, and another for integrating AI into computer science to support problem-solving, software development, and data-driven decision-making. Preliminary results suggest that students using these approaches demonstrate a stronger ability to leverage AI responsibly, critically assess its outputs, and apply it across disciplines. These findings highlight the need for curriculum adaptations that foster critical thinking, ethical awareness, and adaptability in the AI-driven future.},

In this situation, it is a good alternative to use synthetic data. The objective of this research is to generate realistic synthetic data so that people can use it freely. We propose a synthetic data generation model based on boundary-seeking generative adversarial networks (BGANs)-designated as medical BGAN or medBGAN and compare its performances with an existing method medical GAN (medGAN). We aim to perform the investigation on several datasets in two different domains: electronic health records (EHRs) in the medical domain and a crime dataset in the City of Los Angeles Police Department. Firstly, we train the models and generate synthetic data by using these trained models. We then analyze and compare the models' performance by applying some statistical methods (dimension-wise average and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and two machine learning tasks (association rule mining and prediction). The comprehensive analysis of this study shows that the proposed model is more efficient in generating realistic synthetic data than those generated using medGAN.},
