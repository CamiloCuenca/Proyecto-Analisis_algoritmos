  abstract={Programming typically involves humans formulating instructions for a computer to execute computations. If we adhere to this definition, a machine would seemingly lack the capability to autonomously design algorithms. However, recent generative Artificial Intelligence models, such as GPT, have demonstrated an impressive ability to perform complex human tasks with remarkable precision. In this paper, we initially showcase how an AI model can successfully complete an entire college-level programming course, akin to one of the top-performing students in the class. We then put forward strategies for crafting programming exercises that enable educators to effectively integrate these innovative technologies into their teaching methods. Lastly, we illustrate how these models can transition from being perceived as a potential threat to educators to becoming a valuable opportunity when employed judiciously.},

  abstract={The present study proposes the implementation of an air quality measurement tool through the use of a swarm of wearable devices, named WeAIR, consisting of wearable sensors for measuring NOx, CO2, CO, temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure. Data will be stored and processed in a secure cloud environment. Artificial Intelligence algorithms will be used to visualize and make available real-time predictions of future states of air quality, by reconstructing spatio-temporal dynamical maps collected through the habitual movement of citizens in space and time. Then a pre-processing phase will allow us to appropriately homogenize the collected data, by means of the application of innovative artificial intelligence methods. All the data collected will be embedded into an integrated system with multiple functions. Among them, an important goal will also be to raise citizens' awareness of climate change.},

  pages={227-232},
  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), as a form of generative self-supervised learning, have garnered significant attention in anomaly detection. However, the generator's capacity for representation learning is constrained due to its excessive focus on pixel-level details, which hinders its ability to effectively learn abstract semantic representations from label prediction pretext tasks compared to the discriminator. To enhance the generator's representation learning capabilities, we introduce a self-supervised learning framework that integrates generative and discriminative approaches. Our proposed discriminative-generative representation learning method not only rivals the performance of discriminative methods but also offers a significant speed advantage. When applied to one-class anomaly detection tasks, our method surpasses several state-of-the-art models on various benchmark datasets, improving upon the top-performing GAN-based baseline by 6% on CIFAR-10 and 2% on MVTAD. Furthermore, ablation studies reveal that absolute positional information negatively impacts the representational learning ability of generative methods in geometric transformation tasks, offering a valuable guideline for the utilization of positional information.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been a prominent technique across data-driven applications, which uses deep learning architecture to learn the underlying characteristic of the sample to build the knowledge base in generating synthetic samples that mimic the real distribution. Generative AI models are ideal solutions where models suffer due to scarcity of data sample that hinders the training process be it text, video, audio, and image. Training the model plays a pivotal role, where it discovers the hidden pattern and understands the intrinsic behavior of samples that aid in generating realistic samples. The volume of data that is available for training and the computing power required pose threat on the performance of the intelligent systems, where large language models (LLM) has been an ideal solution. LLMs are generative AI systems that understand human language and provide intelligent, creative solutions to questions. Complex architecture of LLM allows them to capture the intricacies of language more precise, enabling to generate coherent and contextually relevant outputs. This chapter delves into comprehensive analysis on the well-known generative AI models such as generative adversarial networks, transformers, and LangChain. Generative AI employs different training techniques such as reinforcement learning, adversarial training, variational inference, transfer learning, and progressive training on diverse application domains. Furthermore, the study examines the crucial aspect of evaluating the effectiveness of generative models, using a variety of metrics ranging from BLUE, inception score, perplexity, Frechet inception distance, precision, ROUGE, recall, METEOR, BERT, MoverScore, and many more. A comparative analysis of these metrics offers insights into their respective advantages and disadvantages, aiding practitioners and researchers in selecting benchmarks that align with their specific use cases.},

  abstract={Due to closed environment of gas insulated switchgear (GIS) chamber, low-light images are easily produced when taking pictures under weak lighting conditions. The lost details and low contrast not only cause unpleasant subjective feelings, but also hurt the performance of many computer vision systems which are designed for normal-light images. Thus, a low-light image enhancement algorithm based on improved conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed here to solve this poor visual perception problem. Decom-Net referenced to RetinexNet used here decompose image into reflection map and illumination map. This study proposed an encode-decode convolutional neural network model as the generative model and a lightweight convolutional neural network(CNN) as the discriminative model. After joint training of generative model and discriminative model, the network outputs the final enhanced images. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective than existing methods in perception.},

  abstract={Face aging is the task aiming to translate the faces in input images to designated ages. To simplify the problem, previous methods have limited themselves only able to produce discrete age groups, each of which consists of ten years. Consequently, the exact ages of the translated results are unknown and it is unable to obtain the faces of different ages within groups. To this end, we propose the continuous face aging generative adversarial networks (CFA-GAN). Specifically, to make the continuous aging feasible, we propose to decompose image features into two orthogonal features: the identity and the age basis features. Moreover, we introduce the novel loss function for identity preservation which maximizes the cosine similarity between the original and the generated identity basis features. With the qualitative and quantitative evaluations on MORPH, we demonstrate the realistic and continuous aging ability of our model, validating its superiority against existing models. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to handle continuous target ages.},

  abstract={Facial expression synthesis is widely applied to emotion prediction and face recognition for human-computer interaction. This task is challenging because it is difficult to reconstruct realistic and accurate facial expressions. Early deep learning methods focus only on pixel-level manipulation and are not suitable for generating realistic facial expressions. In this paper, we propose a bottleneck-layered conditional generative adversarial networks (BCGAN) for more realistic and accurate facial expression synthesis. BCGAN adopts a bottleneck layer that uses channel-wise concatenation in the generator to train with meaningful features only. In addition, a dense connection that links all bottleneck layers is added to generate an image which preserves the facial details of the original image. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations were performed using the Radboud Faces Database (RaFD). Experimental results showed that BCGAN had 2% higher classification accuracy (98.7%) on the generated images as well as faster training speed compared to state-of-the-art approach.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Fingerprint authentication is one of the methods used to prevent the loss of personal data, but the minutiae and angle variance of finger patterns make the process difficult. To overcome the issue, an authentication system for fingerprint orientation using an improved Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) is being developed. The process begins with image enhancement using Contrastive Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) techniques to increase image contrast. Next, GAN with SVM is employed to generate synthetic data through data augmentation, and decision-making is carried out using SVM. Both real and synthetic samples are binarized using the global thresholding technique, and edge-based thinning methods are applied to enhance the fingerprint patterns. Finally, features such as minutiae points of fingerprints are extracted using the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm, serving as input for the SVM classifier. The implemented GAN-SVM model demonstrates superior performance, achieving a False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.12%, a False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 1.3%, an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.29%, and an accuracy of 95.87%. When compared to previous models like Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP), Fuzzy Commitment (FC), and Genetic Encryption Algorithm (GEA).},

  abstract={As a critical component of rotating machinery, the fault diagnosis of bearings holds significant importance. The deep learning-based approach to bearing fault diagnosis necessitates a substantial amount of fault data, which is often challenging to obtain in practical engineering scenarios. This data imbalance issue severely impacts the accuracy of fault diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose a data augmentation method based on Multi-Source Generative Adversarial Network with Quality Assessment and Screening Module (MGAN-QASM). Firstly, the generator and discriminator are restructured using three loss functions, enhancing the stability of training and diversifying the generated data. Secondly, QASM screens for both similar and diverse samples to balance the training dataset. Finally, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks with Wide first-layer kernels (WDCNN) are employed for fault diagnosis. The results show that the proposed method has higher fault diagnosis accuracy than other methods under different imbalance ratio conditions.},

  abstract={We adopt the recent cycle consistent generative adversarial network (MaskCycleGAN-VC) that allows converting a specific singing technique using only a few articulations of singing voice as examples. Since it is often prone to fail to preserve the content information of the singing voice due to distortion and noise during the conversion, a self-supervised learning module is proposed as the basic framework to enforce content consistency without additional annotations. We evaluate the proposed methods on three datasets that were commonly used in pop songs which involve singing techniques in terms of breathy voice, vibrato, and vocal fry. Experiments showed that our proposed methods outperform the baseline in terms of audio quality and content preservation, including melody and singer’s timbral identity, without affecting the perception of singing techniques. 1},

  abstract={Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become central for the perception functions of autonomous vehicles, substantially enhancing their ability to understand and interpret the environment. However, these systems exhibit inherent limitations such as brittleness, opacity, and unpredictable behavior in out-of-distribution scenarios. The European Union (EU) Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act, as a pioneering legislative framework, aims to address these challenges by establishing stringent norms and standards for AI systems, including those used in autonomous driving (AD), which are categorized as high-risk AI. In this work, we explore how the newly available generative AI models can potentially support addressing upcoming regulatory requirements in AD perception, particularly with respect to safety. This short review paper summarizes the requirements arising from the EU AI Act regarding DNN-based perception systems and systematically categorizes existing generative AI applications in AD. While generative AI models show promise in addressing some of the EU AI Act's requirements, such as transparency and robustness, this review examines their potential benefits and discusses how developers could leverage these methods to enhance compliance with the Act. The paper also highlights areas where further research is needed to ensure reliable and safe integration of these technologies.},

  abstract={This paper presents an innovative solution to enhance the transportation experience of pilgrims during Hajj, focusing on the journey from Jeddah to the holy cities of Makkah and Madinah. Managing the transportation of millions of pilgrims within a constrained timeframe poses significant logistical challenges, often addressed using inefficient manual methods. Our approach integrates Generative AI for data extraction and retrieval, Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for algorithmic optimization, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for real-time tracking. The system automates the allocation of pilgrims to buses, optimizing travel distances, reducing the number of buses required, and maximizing capacity utilization. Furthermore, a voice-enabled chat interface powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) provides real-time information access for both staff and pilgrims. Comparative evaluations reveal that our approach outperforms traditional methods, achieving over 40 times faster bus allocations and a 13% reduction in the number of buses required, leading to enhanced efficiency, resource utilization, and cost savings of an approximately 16 million Saudi Riyals in two months. This system ultimately delivers a seamless, efficient, and comfortable transportation experience for pilgrims.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI), owing to recent breakthroughs in deep learning, has revolutionized applications and services in almost all technology domains including aerospace. AI and deep learning rely on huge amounts of training data that are mostly generated at the network edge by Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensors. Bringing the sensed data from the edge of a distributed network to a centralized cloud is often infeasible because of the massive data volume, limited network bandwidth, and real-time application constraints. Consequently, there is a desire to push AI frontiers to the network edge toward utilizing the enormous amount of data generated by IoT devices near the data source. The merger of edge computing and AI has engendered a new discipline, that is, AI at the edge or edge intelligence. To help AI make sense of gigantic data at the network edge, data fusion is of paramount significance and goes hand in hand with AI. This article focuses on data fusion and AI at the edge. In this article, we propose a framework for data fusion and AI processing at the edge. We then provide a comparative discussion of different data fusion and AI models and architectures. We discuss multiple levels of fusion and different types of AI, and how different types of AI align with different levels of fusion. We then highlight the benefits of combining data fusion with AI at the edge. The methods of AI and data fusion at the edge detailed in this article are applicable to many application domains including aerospace systems. We evaluate the effectiveness of combined data fusion and AI at the edge using convolutional neural network models and multiple hardware platforms suitable for edge computing. Experimental results reveal that combining AI with data fusion can impart a speedup of 9.8× while reducing energy consumption up to 88.5% over AI without data fusion. Furthermore, results demonstrate that data fusion either maintains or improves the accuracy of AI in most cases. For our experiments, data fusion imparts a maximum improvement of 15.8% in accuracy to AI.},

  abstract={In today's digital age, the ability to identify, differentiate, and authenticate manipulated online content is essential. Being ability to discriminate between the real and the fake is crucial. Recent advances in technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning are playing a major role in the generation of deepfake media (images and videos). Very realistic deep fake images and videos can be produced by utilizing sophisticated deep learning models such as generative adversarial neural networks (GAN s) and autoencoders, in conjunction with a sizable image collection pertaining to the subject matter. Deepfakes (DF) refer to artificially synthesized images or videos created using features such as face swapping and facial expression recombination. These face manipulation techniques have become extremely sophisticated. Deepfakes can be used to create child pornography, pornographic images of celebrities, revenge porn, fake news and harassment, spreading disinformation on social media platforms, financial fraud, election manipulation, and more. Therefore, there is a need to design and develop a robust framework to identify these deepfake images and videos. The purpose of this paper is to identify deepfakes from visual deepfake datasets and perform a comparative analysis of deep fake detection through machine learning algorithms.},

  abstract={Generative adversarial networks (GANs) for (generalized) zero-shot learning (ZSL) aim to generate unseen image features when conditioned on unseen class embeddings, each of which corresponds to one unique category. Most existing works on GANs for ZSL generate features by merely feeding the seen image feature/class embedding (combined with random Gaussian noise) pairs into the generator/discriminator for a two-player minimax game. However, the structure consistency of the distributions among the real/fake image features, which may shift the generated features away from their real distribution to some extent, is seldom considered. In this paper, to align the weights of the generator for better structure consistency between real/fake features, we propose a novel multigraph adaptive GAN (MGA-GAN). Specifically, a Wasserstein GAN equipped with a classification loss is trained to generate discriminative features with structure consistency. MGA-GAN leverages the multigraph similarity structures between sliced seen real/fake feature samples to assist in updating the generator weights in the local feature manifold. Moreover, correlation graphs for the whole real/fake features are adopted to guarantee structure correlation in the global feature manifold. Extensive evaluations on four benchmarks demonstrate well the superiority of MGA-GAN over its state-of-the-art counterparts.},

  abstract={In consumer electronic applications, to transmit secret images securely, it is required to explore the advanced covert communication technology, i.e., Generative Image Steganography (GIS). However, the existing GIS schemes suffer from the issues of poor stego-image quality and limited hiding capacity. Consequently, these GIS schemes cannot meet the requirements of consumer electronic applications, in which massive secret information needs to be transmitted securely. To address the above issues, we propose a Latent Vector Optimization (LVO)-based GIS scheme, in which the information hiding is implemented by the flow-based generative model during the image generation. Specifically, the LVO algorithm is introduced to compute the hiding probability of each element of latent vector according to its impact on the quality of the stego-image generated from the latent vector. Then, it hides more information in elements with higher hiding probability. The extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to current GIS schemes, the proposed LVO-based GIS scheme generates higher-quality images, while maintaining hiding capacity (up to  $5.0 \, bpp$ ) and accurate information extraction (almost 100% accuracy rate).},

  abstract={Terahertz (THz) images have low spatial resolution, blurring contour features and high background noise owing to the limitation of terahertz (THz) wavelengths and the THz imaging systems. We have proposed a modified Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for super-resolution (SR) purpose. To fit the THz images, we design a kind of image degradation model to generate low-resolution images with Gaussian blur and white Gaussian noise. We establish a dataset of damage images in the field of non-destructive testing (NDT) for training and testing. The experimental results on THz images demonstrate that the improved GAN model can improve the quality of THz images effectively. Our method can be beneficial to improve the accuracy of THz NDT with low resolution.},

  abstract={At present, the intrusion detection model mainly uses anomalous behavior to establish a library of intrusion behavior patterns, and determines whether the intrusion behavior conforms to the intrusion behavior specification by comparing the library of intrusion behavior patterns. Once there is a change in intrusion behavior or a new type of network attack, the existing intrusion detection model cannot make corresponding changes according to the actual changes. Therefore, making intrusion detection models have the ability to learn autonomously and be able to adapt to changes in the network environment to detect new types of unknown attacks has received increasing attention from many security researchers. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection model (CGAN-RF) based on conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) and random forest (RF). The CGAN-RF model improves the class imbalance problem of the dataset by generating samples to enhance the detection efficiency of minority and unknown classes.},

  abstract={Natural language processing has become popular considerably in a wide range of applications, but it still has been rarely applied to automatic text generation. In this paper, we focus on allowing the user to determine which content the machine is to narrate and the user can just give a summary to generate a complete paragraph. Based on the attention mechanism, we propose a Syntax-Guided Machine Reading Comprehension (SG-Net) to accept Chinese word vectors, learn from Chinese data sets, and semi-supervised self-growing generative adversarial network (SG-GAN) generate sequences with more realistic sequences. In order to reasonably evaluate the quality of the text produced by the machine, we also design a set of experiments by manipulating the content of the input sequence semantic information. It can be seen from the experimental results that both SG-Net and SG-GAN can understand the basic semantics and grammar and write a readable article. In summary, SG-Net may only recite the statements that have been read and SG-GAN can understand more semantic and grammar than SG-Net.},

  abstract={It has found that 30% of the people among the visually impaired people are having a significant number of depressive symptoms whereas, the prevalence of depression in blind people was reported to be 33%, or nearly double the rate of the general population. Therefore, social activities among visually impaired people should increase. This research paper provides a unique system for assisting visually impaired individuals in navigating indoor environments heavily relies on the use of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning and computer vision techniques. By leveraging these advanced technologies, the system can analyze and process large amounts of visual data in real-time, accurately identifying and locating various objects in the environment, including faces, doors, stairs, cross walks, traffic lights, potholes and other obstacles. The system then provides real-time feedback to the user via an audio interface, enabling them to navigate indoor and outdoor environments safely and independently. The use of artificial intelligence in this system is particularly significant, as it enables the system to adapt and improve over time based on user feedback and additional data. That means, the system can continuously improve its performance and accuracy, ultimately resulting in a more effective and reliable tool for visually impaired individuals. The authors have also evaluated the system in a real-world setting, demonstrating its effectiveness in assisting visually impaired individuals with indoor navigation. Overall, the proposed system has the potential to significantly enhance the quality of life for visually impaired individuals, showcasing the transformative power of artificial intelligence in addressing real-world challenges.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={2021-2024},
  abstract={This research investigates the effectiveness of employing a machine learning methodology and an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tool for the assessment of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD). Utilizing ResNet34, a convolutional neural network (CNN), trained on a diverse dataset comprising images depicting varying degrees of MGD severity, the machine learning approach endeavors to classify MGD severity into four distinct grades (0, 1, 2, 3) by leveraging extracted characteristic features. Findings reveal comparable accuracy between ResNet34 and the XAI tool, with ResNet34 achieving a slightly lower accuracy of 99.1% in contrast to the XAI tool's 99.4%. However, ResNet34 demonstrates marginally higher precision and F1-score at 98.2% and 98.45%, respectively, suggesting a nuanced advantage in precision-recall equilibrium. Conversely, the XAI tool maintains a commendable precision of 97.2% and an Fl-score of 97.94%, alongside a recall of 98.7%, underscoring its effectiveness in discerning positive instances. Noteworthy is that ResNet34 operates as a black-box model, providing limited interpretability, while the XAI tool emphasizes transparency by furnishing clinicians with understandable MGD grading elucidations derived from meibomian gland segmentation and atrophy analysis. This transparency enhances trust and comprehension, which are integral for clinical acceptance and decision-making. Furthermore, the utilization of XAI heatmap generation facilitates data quality enhancement, as evidenced by instances of erroneous artifact identification, emphasizing the imperative nature of artifact elimination for the refinement of MGD grading procedures.},

  abstract={As AI technology evolves, seeing is not believing. The boundary between human and machine creativity is increasingly blurred, presenting challenges for the art industry. This is more pronounced nowadays as advancements in AI technology make it increasingly easy to create highly realistic synthetic art. This study explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to differentiate AI-generated art from human-created art. By employing Error Level Analysis (ELA), an image forensic technique for detecting fake and real images, this study develops a robust CNN classifier. Using the AI-ArtBench dataset, the optimal model achieves a 99% classification accuracy, even when tested on art from a different generative model. While AI-image detection remains a “cat and mouse” pursuit due to advancements in generative AI, the findings of this study highlight that there are clear, discriminable differences between AI-generated and human-created art. The implications of this research extend beyond academic inquiry. They offer support for artists, collectors, curators, and policymakers as they navigate the complexities of AI’s expanding availability and address the evolving role of AI in the art world. It sets the groundwork for application within fields faced with the same or similar challenges.},

  abstract={Urban populations are always on the increase, increasing the number of vehicles, leading to severe congestion, longer travel times, and substantial emergency vehicle response time delays. This paper presents a routing protocol for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), incorporating a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The proposed system utilizes BDI-based generative AI models, which rely on predefined logic and rules rather than machine learning to make real-time routing decisions. These decisions are based on data from vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, roadside units (RSUs) and IoT sensors, which integrate traffic density, congestion levels, collision avoidance and hazard detection. The system aims to optimize the accuracy of route selection, energy consumption, and communication latency. The simulation results, implemented using NS3 for real-world traffic scenarios, show improvements in route selection accuracy, collision avoidance, and energy efficiency compared to traditional routing methods. Specifically, the proposed system achieved a route selection accuracy of 95%, a collision avoidance rate of 95%, and reduced the communication latency to 105 ms, outperforming the other two methods. Furthermore, energy consumption was minimized and reduced to 85 J per route. These results highlight the potential of BDI-based routing with generative AI to improve ITS performance, particularly in real-time traffic management.},

  abstract={With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, generative video technology offers new possibilities in the field of education, particularly in enhancing women's literary skills and driving educational innovation. Chinese classical poetry, as a cultural treasure, often poses challenges for students due to its abstract imagery and complex content. These challenges are especially pronounced in women's education, where traditional teaching methods often lack intuitiveness and interactivity. This study, based on the generative video capabilities of the Runway ML Gen-3 Alpha model, explores how video generation technology can enhance female students' interest in learning and improve their memory retention by enabling them to perceive the imagery of classical poetry more intuitively. The research analyzes the applicability of generative video technology in women's education from a theoretical perspective and proposes specific methods and pathways for integrating it into classical literature teaching. By emphasizing women's cognitive strengths in visual perception and emotional resonance, the study further investigates how technology-driven teaching models can optimize educational outcomes and achieve a deep integration of traditional literature with modern technology. The findings indicate that generative video technology not only enhances the vividness of learning but also promotes the innovation of educational methods, offering new directions and approaches for cultural heritage and educational reform in the future.},

Denoising and upscaling noisy images are crucial in many computer vision applications, and GANs have shown remarkable effectiveness in creating high-quality images. However, training Style GAN requires huge amount of data and is computationally expensive. To address this issue, this study proposes using various filters such as mean, median, and weighted median to pre-process the noisy images before feeding them to Style GAN. The proposed approach achieves superior denoising and up scaling compared with other system in terms of FID and inception score, and further exploration of hyperparameters and variations of the Style GAN architecture can lead to even better results.},

Unlike similar large AI models in the modalities of image, audio and video, text-based conversation is straightforward and familiar to a large audience of regular users of the Internet and smartphone applications. This is further accentuated by the large-scale adoption of ‘standard’ chatbot technologies for trivial conversations in task-specific automation, across every industry sector. This rare combination of highly effective human-like conversation, familiarity of foundational technology and versatility of intelligent application, has led to several challenges and opportunities in leveraging generative AI. A primary challenge is its impact on the academic integrity of scholarly work, where AI-generated content can be useful and detrimental in both teaching and research. On the other hand, ChatGPT presents a unique opportunity in augmenting preexisting (‘standard’) chatbots with human-like conversation for advanced intelligent automation, across all application domains. Although diametrically opposed, the challenge of addressing academic integrity and the opportunity of augmenting pre-existing chatbots are grounded in the conversational AI capabilities of ChatGPT and similar generative AI models. In this paper, we investigate these formative capabilities and present guidelines for leveraging ChatGPT and similar generative AI models.},

  abstract={Image inpainting is an important field in artificial intelligence, that aims to generate exquisite images from incomplete input images. At present, most methods utilize unilateral structural information to assist in the repair process, but when there is extensive distortion in the image, this method cannot generate beautiful results. Based on this, a wavelet-based dual-flow feature collaborativing GAN (WDFC-GAN) is proposed, which consists of two encoding and decoding subnetworks, namely the wavelet stream and Transformer stream. The wavelet stream is devised to adopt the wavelet transform for better capturing frequency domain features. The Transformer stream is presented to use stacked fast Fourier Transformers (FFTr) to expand the receptive fields effectively. Besides, a wavelet-based self-attention (WSA) is presented for constructing long-range correlated prominent structural information in multidimensional frequency information, thereby generating better results. A large number of qualitative and quantitative experiments have shown that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on Paris StreetView and CelebA-HQ.},

  abstract={The rapid development of artificial intelligence has brought new possibilities to signal processing. In the field of ocean moving target monitoring, traditional array signal processing faces significant challenges due to strong ocean background noise and observation equipment limitations. This paper presents a novel approach for enhancing the directional resolution of ocean sound sources using an oceanic boundary generative adversarial network (OB-GAN). Traditional methods used to analyze underwater sound signals often face challenges in accurately determining the direction of sound sources due to complex environmental conditions. The proposed OB-GAN framework leverages generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn and enhance the spatial features of underwater sound signals, enabling more precise localization of sound sources. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in the directional resolution of ocean sound sources compared to existing methods, showcasing the potential of OB-GAN for advancing underwater acoustic signal processing.},

  abstract={Image Super-Resolution is a technique that is used to obtain high-resolution, realistic images from low-resolution input images. Deep learning algorithms such as SRCNN, ESRGAN, RDN, etc. have shown significant results in this field. But these algorithms at times vary in results. To solve this problem, this research study has proposed an image super-resolution by using Patch Extraction on Deep Learning Algorithm, in which the LR image is first divided into patches and then the algorithms like RDN and ESRGAN are applied. Comparing each patch from each algorithm based on PSNR values, the patch with the highest PSNR value will be selected. After picking up all the patches for that image, it will be reconstructed and hence the super-resolution image will be obtained as the output.},

  abstract={Image inpainting is the technique that's able to “repair” or “correct” the image by reconstructing missing regions of an image using AI algorithms. As the techniques of images inpainting become mature in recent years, the demand for image inpainting algorithms rises in the market. It can be used to fill out missing areas in a picture, denoise images, or even remove a specific object from an image. To this end, it is important to propose a survey for image inpainting method, which can provide a comprehensive introduction of this area. The reason for creating this paper is due to the lack of resources that conclude all the methods that are being used in image inpainting. As the field of image inpainting soars, researchers may need documents which explain all the methods that can be used to train their image inpainting models. In the paper, we gathered some most successful methods that are used by many researchers. We explained their model, methods they used, the results of the training, and the advantages of the approaches they used in their research.},

  abstract={When consumers choose to buy clothing online, virtual try-on technology can provide them with a better shopping experience. The optimization of virtual try-on technology not only helps consumers to evaluate the selected clothing, but also can improve the profit for merchants. However, the traditional virtual try-on technology has problems such as high cost, image distortion, and deviation of clothing style. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a virtual try-on model with enhanced feature representation capability. Through the improved residual block of Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet) and the style encoding module introduced by the Pyramid Squeeze Attention (PSA) module, our model enriches the content and style information, strengthens the representation ability of features, and the reconstructed image preserves the more details. Compared with related work, we improve the structural similarity measure by 1.1% and the Inception Score by 10.1%. It is demonstrated that our model can reconstruct more accurate and realistic images.},

In this article, we show how large language models (LLMs), such as generative pretrained transformer (GPT), can augment the early phases of innovation, in particular, exploration, ideation, and digital prototyping. Drawing on six months of experimenting with LLMs in internal and client innovation projects, we share first-hand experiences and concrete examples of AI-assisted approaches. The article highlights a large variety of use cases for generative AI ranging from user journey mapping to idea generation and prototyping and foreshadows the promising role LLMs may play in future knowledge management systems. Moreover, we argue that generative AI may become a game changer in early prototyping as the delegation of tasks to an artificial agent can result in faster iterations and reduced costs. Our experiences also provide insights into how human innovation teams purposively and effectively interact with AIs and integrate them into their workflows.},

  abstract={With the continuous evolution of network attack methods, traditional rule-based and signature-based security strategies are becoming increasingly hard to deal with increasingly complex network threats. The research focuses on the problem of network traffic anomaly detection in network security, and proposes an improved Transformer and Generative Adversarial Networks network traffic anomaly detection model. The innovation lies in utilizing the Patch segmentation in the Transformer module to reduce information loss, while introducing random masked data blocks to enhance the anti-interference ability of Generative Adversarial Networks, and proposing a class balance model. Therefore, a Transformer Multi Receive Field Fusion (Trans-M) model for network traffic anomaly detection is constructed. The performance test results showed that after category balancing, the accuracy, recall, and F1-score of each model were been significantly improved. The accuracy of the Trans-M model on the balanced dataset arrived 98.12%, an improvement of 8.59% compared to before balancing. The recall rate of the Trans-M model was improved by 8.62% to 97.86%. On Balanced F Score (F1-score), the highest score of the Trans-M model was 98.46%, which was 8.18% higher than before balancing. The experiment outcomes demonstrate that the raised network traffic anomaly detection system is superior to common anomaly traffic detection models and can meet the actual network security protection needs.},

  abstract={Summary <p>Among the many ethical and societal concerns are the propagation of false information and the potential for malicious uses, as well as the risk of us becoming overly dependent on the technology (and thereby losing vital human skills). GenAI gives people and organizations the ability to produce masses of content, making it very easy to spread misinformation or disinformation. Another concern is that we'll become overly dependent on GenAI, which could lead to the withering of key human skills. Many of the big AI companies are of course working to mitigate the ethical challenges surrounding GenAI. Meta, for instance, says it is working with governments, AI experts, and privacy experts to establish &#x201c;responsible guardrails&#x201d; for its AI features. And there's the environmental impact of GenAI in terms of the massive energy usage, and the rare earth materials used in the production of AI hardware.</p>},

  abstract={In generative artificial intelligence (AI) enabled intelligent transportation systems (ITS), real-time interaction and analysis of massive multi-source data are the core drivers for system optimization. However, large scale outsourcing storage of data, while enhancing computational efficiency, also poses security threats such as data integrity compromise, sensitive information leakage, and malicious tampering. These issues severely impact the quality of generative AI model training and the reliability of system services. Although existing cloud provable data possession (PDP) schemes can verify data integrity, they incur high computational overhead in ITS scenarios and lack support for fine-grained data retrieval. To address the need for specific data auditing by data users in generative AI enabled ITS, we propose a keyword searchable provable data possession scheme, which integrates data integrity verification with efficient data retrieval. First, a lightweight indexing approach is integrated to optimize the keyword search process, allowing different data users to initiate keyword based targeted queries based on their specific business needs, with integrity verification performed only on matching data blocks. Second, an efficient integrity auditing scheme is designed to ensure the integrity of outsourced intelligent vehicle data. Finally, security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves acceptable efficiency in computation overhead compared to existing works, while improving the auditability and searchability of outsourced ITS data.},

The single-channel vibration signal data from a faulty motor serves as the case study. Fault vibration signals can rapidly, accurately, and comprehensively reflect the nature and extent of mechanical faults. The study compares and analyzes the results of PSO, GA, and random number (RN) optimization of GAN parameters. The findings demonstrate that PSO outperforms GA in terms of time efficiency and reducing generation errors. Swarm intelligence algorithms eliminate the need for manual experience or repetitive trials when selecting parameters.

ATM fraud is a prevalent issue faced in today's banking landscape. The critical challenges in fraud datasets are highly imbalanced datasets, evolving fraud patterns, and lack of explainability. In this study, we handled these techniques on an ATM transaction dataset collected from India. In binary classification, we investigated the effectiveness of various over-sampling techniques, such as the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and its variants, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), to achieve oversampling. Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT), outperformed the rest of the techniques by achieving an AUC of 0.963, and Decision Tree (DT) stands second with an AUC of 0.958. In terms of complexity and interpretability, DT is the winner. Among the oversampling approaches, SMOTE and its variants performed better. We incorporated explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and Causal Inference (CI) in the fraud detection framework and studied them via various analyses. Further, we provided managerial impact.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) holds immense promise in revolutionizing biomedical research, particularly in the field of early medical assistance analysis. This paper explores the application of AI in the context of laryngeal cancer, a disease where early screening, accurate diagnosis, effective management, and favorable prognosis are crucial for patient outcomes. The implementation of AI in biomedical field practice always faces challenges due to data scarcity. The limited availability of data leads to less satisfactory testing results. Even if the methods like geometric transformation and photometric transformation have been applied, it does not still enlarge the diversity in nature of data. Here, we investigated CTGAN on tabular radiomics features in a public laryngeal cancer dataset to check how various amount of data augmentation affects classifier's performance. The results were assessed by the synthetic data reports which captures the similarity with the columns shapes score (median value 71.23 %) and the trend and correction across columns with a column pair score median value 90.30%. The synthetic data respect the original data structure(100%) and overall synthetic data validity is above 81 %. It enhances the diversity and increase the amount of training data for laryngeal cancer detection. After assessing the synthetic report, a comparison of performances across different classifiers was followed. Result shows an increases in accuracy from 5 % to 10%. This proves the positive performance of the classifying improvement on an independent testing dataset (real data) and provides clues how much data should be synthesized. Our paper provides a positive and meaningful reference on tabular radiomics data augmentation for medical intelligent diagnosis design in the future.},

We explore the impact of dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and data balancing with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on imbalanced class distributions. The assessment relies on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results indicate that Random Forest demonstrates the best overall performance, especially when paired with GAN-based data balancing techniques.

  year={2024},
  volume={11},
  number={5},
  pages={7828-7840},
  abstract={To achieve a high-learning accuracy, generative adversarial networks (GANs) must be fed by large data sets that adequately represent the data space. However, in many scenarios, the available data sets may be limited and distributed across multiple agents, each of which is seeking to learn the distribution of the data on its own. In such scenarios, the agents often do not wish to share their local data as it can cause communication overhead for large data sets. In this article, to address this multiagent GAN problem, a novel brainstorming GAN (BGAN) architecture is proposed using which multiple agents can generate real-like data samples while operating in a fully distributed manner. BGAN allows the agents to gain information from other agents without sharing their real data sets but by “brainstorming” via the sharing of their generated data samples. In contrast to existing distributed GAN solutions, the proposed BGAN architecture is designed to be fully distributed, and it does not need any centralized controller. Moreover, BGANs are shown to be scalable and not dependent on the hyperparameters of the agents’ deep neural networks (DNNs) thus enabling the agents to have different DNN architectures. Theoretically, the interactions between BGAN agents are analyzed as a game whose unique Nash equilibrium is derived. Experimental results show that BGAN can generate real-like data samples with higher quality and lower Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and Frèchet inception distance (FID) compared to other distributed GAN architectures.},

  abstract={Pre-trained generators have been frequently adopted in compressed sensing (CS) owing to their ability to effectively estimate signals with the prior of NNs. To further refine the NN-based prior, we propose a framework that allows the generator to utilize additional information from given measurements of training samples for prior learning, thereby yielding more accurate reconstruction for signals. As our framework has a simple form, it can be easily applied to existing CS methods using pre-trained generators. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms these works by a large margin and can reduce the reconstruction error up to an order of magnitude for the presented target applications. We also explain the experimental success theoretically by showing that our framework can slightly relax the stringent signal presence condition, which is required to guarantee the success of signal recovery.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) tools have changed the course of academic teaching and learning practices, particularly, the way of writing assessment and scholarly reports. Although the use of Artificial Intelligence based tools or similar systems is not new to academia, advanced Gen-AI tools such as Chat-GPT has opened a new path for academic misconduct. The use of Gen-AI tools forced academic institutions to adapt new policies around the use of AI generated content in assessments and research. Reputed plagiarism checking tools like Turnitin has provided AI detection mechanisms with little success, due to inconsistency in the results attributed to the quality of detection algorithms. Tools like ZeroGPT, Originality.ai, GPTZero, etc., are exclusively developed for detecting AI generated content. However, at present, some Gen-AI based companies like StealthAI, AIHumanizer etc., are offering services that can be used to evade detection tools for plagiarism. These services use advanced algorithms and techniques to identify patterns and rewrite the content to mimic human styled text. This posed serious challenges in identifying academic misconduct. This research explores various tools that learners use or can be used in assessments and research that can evade AI and plagiarism detection. A list of 6 reputed tools like StealthAI, AIHumanizer, ByPassGPT are reviewed to identify how these tools evade AI detection. The problem of academic misconduct is critically evaluated using literature, and the practical implications of misconduct are presented. As this ongoing research is closely aligned with learner abilities, the impact of Gen-AI is presented through the lenses of learners.},

  abstract={Three-dimensional geological modeling of reservoirs is of great significance for developing oil and gas resources, groundwater resources, and carbon dioxide geological storage. Geological facies models are the basis for accurately predicting underground oil reservoirs, geological carbon dioxide storage potential, and groundwater resources. Traditional geostatistical modeling methods can be consistent with geological models to some extent, but there are obvious shortcomings when the characteristics of geological models become complex. Therefore, this paper takes the braided river deltaic diversion channel and estuarine dam phase of the Hanjiang Formation in the Epping Depression of the Pearl River Estuary Basin as the research objective. Based on the geological background of the workings, 3D seismic data and seven logging wells, a conditionally bounded phase simulation based on an improved GAN model is proposed. The research results show that the phase model generated by modeling well facies data matches the input well facies data. The generated phase model has good diversity, and the trained generator can generate high-quality phase models with 100%. accuracy in reproducing well facies.},

  abstract={The amazing progress in conversational AI such as ChatGPT seems to be driving people into an era where human-AI co-creation is prevalent. Efforts need to focus on the new context of creativity development, as AI is more to creativity than simplifying creative tasks. The current study aims to explore the possible impact of AI on creativity and how students co-create with it in a way that optimizes its benefits. Whereas AI may challenge the position of humans in certain creative tasks, we argue that it provides multiple supports to the creative process. Accordingly, we proposed a conceptual framework of the impact of human-AI co-creation on creativity based on creativity theories and the SAMR model. Then we concluded with four principles of student-AI co-creation.},

  pages={3431-3444},
  abstract={Semisupervised domain adaptation (SSDA) aims at training a high-performance model for a target domain using few labeled target data, many unlabeled target data, and plenty of auxiliary data from a source domain. Previous works in SSDA mainly focused on learning transferable representations across domains. However, it is difficult to find a feature space where the source and target domains share the same conditional probability distribution. Additionally, there is no flexible and effective strategy extending existing unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches to SSDA settings. In order to solve the above two challenges, we propose a novel fine-tuning framework, semisupervised transfer boosting (SS-TrBoosting). Given a well-trained deep learning-based UDA or SSDA model, we use it as the initial model, generate additional base learners by boosting, and then use all of them as an ensemble. More specifically, half of the base learners are generated by supervised domain adaptation, and half by semisupervised learning. Furthermore, for more efficient data transmission and better data privacy protection, we propose a source data generation approach to extend SS-TrBoosting to semisupervised source-free domain adaptation (SS-SFDA). Extensive experiments showed that SS-TrBoosting can be applied to a variety of existing UDA, SSDA, and SFDA approaches to further improve their performance.},

  abstract={As artificial intelligence tools such as GitHub Copilot, Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), or Black Box Artificial Intelligence (BlackBoxAI) become more embedded in software development workflows, they are reshaping how architects approach modern software design. While enterprises are increasingly leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools to enhance developer productivity, limited research has been conducted on their impact on software architects. Traditionally, architects utilize various tools to create architectural blueprints, including Unified Modelling Language (UML) diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, use case diagrams, and state diagrams. Many of these diagrams follow repetitive structures that can be automated with well-defined contexts. This paper examines the role of three AI tools in assisting architects during the design phase, assessing how closely the generated outputs adhere to established architectural principles. By analyzing deviations, the study explores how refined prompts and additional context can improve accuracy. Research also includes cross tool comparison. Ultimately, this research aims to evaluate the potential of AI assistant tools to enhance productivity, ensure design consistency, and support architectural decision-making, while providing best practices for integrating AI into modern software architecture.},

A new Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is proposed to unveil how Human visual perception takes place, focusing on how human beings perceive images, firstly, coarse structures and then their details. The network called 3G-AN consists of three generation stages and a single Discriminator. In this paper, a novel three-branch generator is proposed, which takes into account Coarse, Medium, and Fine structure of a given image. Coarse RGB decomposition image provides the general structure, while Medium RGB stage provides general-fine structure. Finally, Fine RGB decomposition provides fine details of the image. The proposal is tested on MNIST, CIFAR10, and Celebrity faces databases, generating realistic images with almost no anomalies. The RGB decomposition into coarse, medium, and fine, allows to understand the composition of an image from a structural point of view. The qualitative analysis carried out in this research paper outperforms the six most competitive models existing in the literature.},

  pages={2743-2753},
  abstract={In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the domain of image restoration, particularly in the context of repairing damaged images and super-resolution reconstruction, primarily owing to the emergence of deep learning techniques. However, during the course of transmission across various media devices, the original image quality may deteriorate due to factors such as the network environment, hardware constraints, and related conditions. Moreover, the restoration process becomes increasingly challenging when the original image quality is low or compromised. Presently, prevailing methods involve repairing the image prior to performing super-resolution reconstruction. However, this methodology typically relies on the utilization of multiple autonomous models, where the efficacy and time efficiency are not optimal. In light of this, we propose a novel neural network model based on GAN, termed ISRnet, designed to repair damaged compressed images. Our method is the first to leverage GAN networks specifically for compressed image restoration. ISRnet integrates the principles of image inpainting and super-resolution reconstruction, enabling the transformation of low-resolution images into high-resolution counterparts during the restoration process, thereby achieving superior restoration outcomes. Despite the partial increase in bias, this approach counteracts the variability inherent in a singularly trained neural network model. Compared to a single neural network model trained on the same dataset, our model demonstrates reduced variance and diminished sensitivity to data, thereby achieving optimal restoration quality and expedited repair speeds for damaged compressed images. Consequently, our proposed methodology presents a promising avenue for the utilization of neural networks in repairing damaged compressed images.},

  abstract={GAN is a model that generates completely new data and can create various media contents. CartoonGAN is a GAN model that converts real images into cartoon style, and can apply various cartoon styles. In this study, we propose ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks) technology as a preprocessing method to improve the performance of CartoonGAN. ESRGAN is a model that improves resolution using GAN. This method showed better performance than other SR techniques in the evaluation indices MSE, PSNR, and SSIM results. This suggests that ESRGAN is effective in high-resolution restoration ability and visual quality improvement in cartoon style image conversion. The method proposed in this study can be used as a useful tool for high-resolution cartoon image generation. Since the learning data of the model is limited to a specific domain, there may be limitations in generalizability. Due to the characteristics of ESRGAN, which is computationally complex and consumes a lot of resources, there may be limitations in applying it to real-time processing or large datasets. In future studies, it is necessary to build an extended dataset for various images to overcome these limitations. It is important to reduce computational costs by making models lightweight and optimizing them, and to develop algorithms suitable for real-time processing. It is expected that these additional studies and improvements will be utilized to produce high-quality images.},

  pages={143-146},
  abstract={Stress management and relaxation are critical areas of interest in mental health and well-being. Forest bathing is a practice that has been shown to have a positive effect on reducing stress by stimulating all the senses in an immersive nature experience. Since access to nature is not universally available to everyone, virtual reality has emerged as a promising tool to simulate this type of experience. Furthermore, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools offer new opportunities to create highly personalized and immersive experiences that can enhance relaxation and reduce stress. This study explores the potential of personalized multisensory VR environments, designed using GenAI tools, to optimize relaxation and stress relief via two experiments that are currently underway. The first evaluates the effectiveness of non-personalized versus personalized VR scenes generated using AI tools to promote increased relaxation. The second explores the potential benefits of providing the user with additional personalization tools, from adding new virtual elements to the AI-generated scene, to adding AI-generated sounds and scent/haptics customization. Ultimately, this research aims to identify which customizable elements may lead to improved therapeutic benefits for multisensory VR experiences.},

  year={2025},
  volume={39},
  number={2},
  pages={44-51},
  abstract={It has become a consensus that the integration of computing, sensing, and communication with ubiquitous intelligence will be the cornerstone of the sixth-generation (6G) network. The concept of edge computing and intelligence, which push the frontier of computation closer to the data source, is a suitable paradigm that aligns with these visions of 6G. In this article, we introduce Agent-as-a-Service (AaaS), an AI-native edge computing framework that leverages AI agents for both the control-plane operations and user-plane services of the 6G network. In the AaaS framework, agents can perform computing, sensing, and communicating tasks automatically by harnessing of the pervasive intelligence offered by 6G infrastructures. By AI-native, we refer to redesigning the whole lifecycle of an edge computing task to align with the prominent reasoning and planning ability of the generative AI. The lifecycle includes plan generation, execution orchestration, resource management, and long-term evolvement. The AaaS framework is built upon emerging techniques such as deviceless computing and WebAssembly to cope with the heterogeneous and geo-distributed 6G edge deployments. Based on the AaaS framework, we conduct a case study on autonomous driving in 6G edge computing to showcase the benefits in terms of overall latency reduction. Finally, we outline potential research directions to form a more efficient and integrated 6G edge computing with artificial intelligence.},

  abstract={At present, transfer learning of machine fault is a relatively popular research, its main problem is the imbalance of training data caused by the lack of actual fault data. The existing incremental learning model cannot solve the entanglement problem of sample features, and the ability to obtain new samples by combining features is limited. In this paper, Style-based Generative Adversarial Networks (StyleGAN) is used to map the data features to intermediate latent space, and then generate data by recombining features. StyleGAN realizes the complete separation of signal features. Therefore, StyleGAN can be used as a tool of data incremental learning to enrich the original data, solve the problem of imbalance between training data and test data, and achieve the goal of improving the accuracy of fault classification in the later stage. In the process of training, the category label is used as the auxiliary information to help the training model. The data of training set is enhanced, and the accuracy of fault diagnosis and classification is improved, the accuracy of fault classification network model is increased from 81.4% to more than 90%, so the validity of this method is proved.},

  abstract={This research investigates the transformative impact of AI technologies such as DALL-E, ChatGPT, and other generative AI tools on the arts, particularly focusing on their implications for 2D artwork. These advancements have democratized the creation of 2D art, making it more accessible, but they have also raised concerns about the value of original talent and the potential impact on careers in the arts. The study employs the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to evaluate the acceptance and impact of generative AI among individuals in creative fields, including students, lecturers, and professionals. Data collected from 127 respondents through structured surveys indicate high levels of engagement with generative AI, reflecting significant curiosity and usage rates. Analysis using SmartPLS 4.0 Tools validated the initial research model, demonstrating that generative AI significantly influences perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and behavioral intention in 2D art creation. These findings underscore the critical need to consider AI's evolving role in the arts, its impact on perceptions of creativity and talent, and its broader implications for the creative industry. The study tested seven hypotheses, with six accepted and one rejected. This indicates that while factors like user computer self-efficacy and quality information significantly influence the perceived usefulness and ease of use of generative AI, ease of use alone does not necessarily lead to a positive attitude towards its use. However, perceived usefulness significantly contributes to a positive attitude towards using generative AI. Additionally, a positive attitude towards generative AI influences the behavioral intention to use it, thereby enhancing skills and providing inspiration for creating artwork.},

  abstract={In recent years, the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies has become a key factor in the development of modern communication systems. Through the deep integration of AI and IoT, the intelligence level of the network has been greatly improved, achieving higher data transmission speed, lower latency, and higher reliability to meet the growing communication needs. Especially in the context of intelligence networking and edge computing, large-scale language models (LLM) such as the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) series have extended the capabilities to handle complex tasks and predict user intentions, programming, and planning. These capabilities provide new possibilities for optimizing communication systems, reducing semantic communication costs, and customizing services according to user preferences. This article explores the application of blockchain and AI large models in the edge intelligence of the Internet of Things, and proposes a distributed, non-tamperable knowledge and learning achievement recording system based on blockchain technology and AI large models. The system is designed to automatically generate code to train new models in a privacy-preserving manner. Experimental results show that the system can accurately understand user needs, efficiently execute, and create high-performance artificial intelligence models at minimal cost on edge servers.},

  abstract={Our Gen Alpha, born between year 2010 and 2024 see and experience more of AI and they adapt quickly to AI and will have less impact on advancements in Technology when compared to Generation X (19651980); Generation Y (Millennials) born from 1980 to 1994; Generation Z from 1995 to 2009. The reason is that Gen Alpha constantly uses electronic gadgets either in gaming, learning or for social media. They are susceptible quickly to Generative AI when compared to Gen X, Gen Y or Gen Z. Especially in Academia, where Gen Alpha is more encouraged to Generative AI such as ChatGPT in homework, assignments, and in research. Well, this is a good approach for those who are struggling to complete their work or for those who do not have a clue on how to complete their homework, assignment, or research. On other hand, the Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT are slowly becoming a part of the eco system that students lean on the Generative AI tools instead of doing research or thinking critically. As a result, there will be some behavioral changes that will be developed over a period. These behavioral changes are, impatient for answers to the problems, express panic while solving a problem, shows anxiety, low self-esteem in solving a problem, and low confidence factor. There is always a positive side of Generative AI, if we look at it from a different angle. Some of them are, it helps an individual and guides them with possible answers, all individuals can ask questions using prompt engineering and get responses. But the fact of the matter is how authentic the response from Generative AI is a question? Can the author quote the responses he/she received from ChatGPT and How can we avoid plagiarism? How can we reduce bias? How can we avoid AI singularity?},

Advanced generative AI methods including GANs and VAEs are examined for data augmentation, model training, and other robustness improvements. The research shows that integrating generative AI with machine learning pipelines can dramatically boost the performance of machine learning models, especially in data-scarce settings.

  abstract={The interest to look into alternative engineered materials, which would maximize the efficiency and performance attributes in numerous modern engineering application as well as to push the boundary imposed by present-day material science in the field engineering, is ever so high. One commonly searched feature in engineered materials is their high strength-to-weight ratio. The new AI (Artificial Intelligence) -driven technique of generative design has revolutionized the method of design refinement in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) by enabling advanced optimization techniques which was formerly-unavailable. This study seeks to apply the technique of generative design to improve the flexural behaviour of small clear Polylactic acid (PLA) specimens produced through the additive manufacturing process. The results obtained have shown that despite the optimized material geometry and weight, the refined model was still able to bear significantly high bending loads. Further analysis via the Finite Element Method (FEM) was conducted to substantiate the experimental investigation. Findings of this study illustrates the benefits of generative design which can seamlessly provide advanced design refinements all while preserving or enhancing mechanical performance of the material.},

Central to this transformation is Data Center Networking (DCN), which not only provides the infrastructure support for GenAI operation, but also provisions GenAI services to users. Hence, this article explores the interplay between GenAI and DCNs, analyzing their symbiotic relationship and mutual advances. We begin by reviewing the current challenges of DCNs and GenAI-based solutions, such as data augmentation, process automation, and domain transfer. We then discuss the distinctive characteristics of GenAI workloads on DCNs, gaining insights that catalyze the evolution of DCNs to more effectively support GenAI. Moreover, to illustrate the seamless integration of GenAI with DCNs, we present a case study on GenAI-empowered DCN digital twins. Specifically, we employ an LLM equipped with retrieval augmented generation to formulate optimization problems for DCNs (e.g., resource allocation and routing) and adopt diffusion-deep reinforcement learning to solve optimization. The experimental results on a representative DCN optimization problem, i.e., knowledge placement, demonstrate the validity and efficiency of our proposals. We anticipate that this article can promote further research to enhance the virtuous interaction between GenAI and DCNs.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are emerging as a critical technological capability of the 21st century and have been spreading their influence in various fields of education, including early childhood education (ECE) in recent years. When properly used and thoughtfully integrated into teaching, AI can be a powerful and effective tool in the classroom, not only to provide inspiration, generate ideas and encourage creativity for both children and teachers, but most importantly to prepare them for a future where technology plays an increasingly important role in schooling. For early childhood educators, AI can also be a tremendous assistant as an administrative helper, idea generator or data organizer, helping teachers to think outside the box and prepare for teaching more creatively and effectively. It appears that there is a growing need for early childhood educators to have not only pedagogical expertise but also a strong foundation in AI literacy, and that pre-service teachers need to be equipped with the ability to use AI appropriately in their formative or undergraduate stages. Therefore, this study aims to explore the ability of early childhood education students to use AI in the creation of picture books for young children, and seeks to provide insights into the potential strengths, weaknesses and ethical issues of integrating AI into early childhood education undergraduate course.},

This study explores the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specifically Cycle- Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (Cycle GAN) and Conditional GAN(C-GAN), to generate a map image from a satellite image, that is easy to read and understand. By conditioning the generator and discriminator networks on the input satellite images and target map domain, the model picks up on certain distinguishable features from the satellite image and the map image to generate a map image. A Cycle-GAN doesn’t require the use of paired datasets, unlike C-GAN. This research study also briefly discusses about the various features that the Cycle-GAN applies to generate an accurate image. Various loss functions such as GAN loss, identity loss, and Cycle consistency loss that the GAN employs to improve the resolution of the image are also discussed in the study.},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Neural Networks (NNs) are a vast field of research, particularly in terms of adjusting hyper-parameters such as hidden layers (HLs) and hidden neurons (HNs). On the other hand, (NN)s presents the main component of GAN's two elements: (1) Generator (G) and (2) Discriminator (D). It improves GAN as NN optimizes its parts. The number of Hidden Layers (HLs) and Hidden Neurons (HNs) inside the neural networks remains an important research topic despite numerous rules trying to predict the values by some directives and calculations. However, the study of the deepness and wideness of both (G) and (D) is still under-explored, and exploring this topic in GAN was neglected. Hence, this research focuses on the (NN)s contained in the original architecture of GAN and targets to clarify the relation between the number of (HL)s and (HN)s in the Generator (G) and the Discriminator (D) inside GAN. Furthermore, the goal is to determine which (NN) should have the most significant number of (HL) and (HN) in order to improve the performance of the created samples. Therefore, experiments were carried out by (1) increasing the number of (HL)s equally or differently in the G and the D and (2) increasing the number of (HN)s in each (HL) either on G or D. Deep Neural Network (DNN) is chosen as an intrusion detection system (IDS) model and the benchmark dataset KDD99 was used for application. It has been observed that a large number of (HL)s and (HN)s in the (G) improved GAN training and convergence. It means that the (G) should have more critical (HL)s and (HN)s than the (D) to generate better samples. Thus, this study provides the researchers with a vital resource to optimize the GAN's (NN)s and to process the experiments in this field by standardizing the number of (HL)s and (HN)s. The experiments carried out revealed that better training and convergence are seen when the number of (HL)s is 10 and the number of (HN)s is 1024 in the (G). The highest accuracy completed is 0.9991 which is 10 (HL)s and 1024 (HN)s in the Generator, and 2 (HL)s and 64 (HN)s in the Discriminator.},

  pages={1410-1423},
  abstract={In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in face image editing due to the success of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). However, state-of-the-art face editing methods mainly suffer from the following two limitations: 1) they are only applicable to face images with relative low-resolutions and 2) multi-attribute face editing may generate uncontrollable changes in non-target face attribute categories. To solve these problems, we propose a novel High-Quality Generative Adversarial Network (HQ-GAN) for controllable editing of multiple face attributes in high-resolution images. HQ-GAN has two novel ideas to break the limitations of resolution and controllability correspondingly: 1) fine-grained textures and realistic details of high-resolution face images are better preserved with the aid of textural features extracted by the wavelet transform module and 2) desired multi-attribute targets of face editing are emphasized using a weighted binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss so that the influence on non-target attributes is greatly reduced. To the best of our knowledge, HQ-GAN is the first attempt to achieve continuous editing of multiple face attributes on high-resolution images of the CelebA-HQ using only 28 000 training samples. Extensive qualitative results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in rendering realistic high-resolution face images with accurate attribute modification, and comprehensive quantitative results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art face editing methods.},

  abstract={Rapid advances in the field of artificial intelligence have made significant contributions to the automation of software development and testing stages. Software created for use in various fields is tested with test scenarios created manually by software test experts or using test automation. Testing large-scale software with these methods complicates the testing phases because it requires increased human intervention and includes complex applications. In this study, an LLM-based scenario generation framework enhanced with prompt engineering is proposed for testing software to be used for video analysis in smart cities and smart campus areas. Thus, software test scenarios are created by strengthening large language models that are fast, flexible and have high learning ability using prompt engineering techniques. Test scenarios produced through LLM reinforced with prompt engineering techniques were evaluated with rarity and reality metrics and it was determined that more robust scenarios were produced compared to randomly generated test scenarios in the relevant field.},

  abstract={Cyber threats can cause severe damage to computing infrastructure and systems as well as data breaches that make sensitive data vulnerable to attackers and adversaries. It is therefore imperative to discover those threats and stop them before bad actors penetrating into the information systems.Threats hunting algorithms based on machine learning have shown great advantage over classical methods. Reinforcement learning models are getting more accurate for identifying not only signature-based but also behavior-based threats. Quantum mechanics brings a new dimension in improving classification speed with exponential advantage. The accuracy of the AI/ML algorithms could be affected by many factors, from algorithm, data, to prejudicial, or even intentional. As a result, AI/ML applications need to be non-biased and trustworthy.In this research, we developed a machine learning-based cyber threat detection and assessment tool. It uses two-stage (both unsupervised and supervised learning) analyzing method on 822,226 log data recorded from a web server on AWS cloud. The results show the algorithm has the ability to identify the threats with high confidence.},

  abstract={The uncertainty of wind power output poses significant challenges to the stable operation of power systems. Artificial intelligence-based scenario generation approach offers a new way to frame uncertainty in wind power. However, generative adversarial networks (GANs) face challenges, including limited ability to effectively capture temporal information, instability during the training process, and susceptibility to mode collapse. To this end, this paper proposes a Temporal Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (TC-GAN) for renewable energy output generation. Temporal convolutional networks are embedded in both the generator and discriminator of conditional generative adversarial networks (CGAN), with the Wasserstein distance serving as the loss function for the discriminator. This design enables adversarial training to effectively capture the mapping relationships between noise and scenarios in day-ahead forecasting conditions. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation metric system for generated scenarios was developed, employing statistical analysis methods to assess scenario quality. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed model effectively captures temporal dependencies and enhances the accuracy of wind power scenario generation.},

  abstract={Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) have emerged as a transformative force in the realm of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), demonstrating their versatility and efficacy across various applications. The ability to model complex data distributions and generate high-quality samples has made GDMs particularly effective in tasks such as image generation and reinforcement learning. Furthermore, their iterative nature, which involves a series of noise addition and denoising steps, is a powerful and unique approach to learning and generating data. This paper serves as a comprehensive tutorial on applying GDMs in network optimization tasks. We delve into the strengths of GDMs, emphasizing their wide applicability across various domains, such as vision, text, and audio generation. We detail how GDMs can be effectively harnessed to solve complex optimization problems inherent in networks. The paper first provides a basic background of GDMs and their applications in network optimization. This is followed by a series of case studies, showcasing the integration of GDMs with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), incentive mechanism design, Semantic Communications (SemCom), Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks, etc. These case studies underscore the practicality and efficacy of GDMs in real-world scenarios, offering insights into network design. We conclude with a discussion on potential future directions for GDM research and applications, providing major insights into how they can continue to shape the future of network optimization.},
