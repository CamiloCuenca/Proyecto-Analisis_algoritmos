  abstract={Summary <p>The term &#x201c;artificial intelligence&#x201d; (AI) refers to a remarkable technology enabling computers to carry out activities consistent with human behavior. It was in 1956 that John McCarthy first used the term &#x201c;artificial intelligence,&#x201d; and since then, it has become an indispensable component of our everyday life. AI is now the most widely used source of computation, and its applications range from automated voice systems to personalized movie suggestions. On the other hand, these systems depend on intricate methods such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. As the way we interact with technology continues to be revolutionized by AI, it is essential to consider the potential privacy and security risks that come with it. Specifically, gathering and utilizing sensitive patient information to train AI models has given rise to significant issues. Patients, healthcare providers, and software vendors can suffer serious repercussions due to any utilization or disclosure of patient information. As a result of these worries, this chapter investigates the development and incorporation of AI into our health and information systems, with a particular emphasis on protecting personal information and safety.</p>},

  abstract={The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in 6G demonstrates a transformative leap in redefining network efficiency, intelligence, and adaptability. However, AI largely leverages discriminative models relying on labelled and quality data, where data accessibility remains serious concern. Generative AI (GenAI) has gained traction due to its immense potential in resolving the issue of data scarcity, complexity, and incompleteness. GenAI models excel in understanding underlying data distributions, enabling them to generate synthetic data that mirrors real-world patterns. GenAI supports adaptive learning and scenario modeling, making it indispensable for addressing the unpredictability and complexity inherent in 6G networks. Since the complexity of wireless communication systems is increasing and the demand for such systems is growing, GenAI presents new ideas for enhancing network performance, increasing system efficiency, and developing intelligent decision-making capabilities. This survey paper investigates the promising role of GenAI in the evolution of 6G networks. An in-depth discussion of notable GenAI models is presented, outlining their application in enhancing key network components. Specifically, the application of GenAI in advanced technologies including reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), digital twins (DTs), and integrated sensing and communications (ISACs) is thoroughly investigated with respect to optimize the adaptability, flexibility, and robustness of the wireless networks. Moreover, use cases of GenAI-enabled wireless networks are presented to highlight the realization of GenAI in 6G. The paper also presents the lessons learned, existing challenges, and future research directions. This paper systematically explores GenAI and its pivotal role in the development of 6G, providing a foundation for researchers to further investigate and advance GenAI-enabled 6G.},

  abstract={Consumer electronic devices are popular in human’s everyday use, and cover a wide range of devices and services. Consumer electronics like smartphone and tablet use digital technologies to enhance human’s entertainment and health. The creation of digital content or data augmentation sometimes requires using generative artificial intelligence technologies. Although data generation systems have been successfully used in some consumer products, it is still challenging to create a powerful generative system due to the complexity of input signals and the difficulty of model training. In this paper, a multistage evolutionary generative adversarial network (GAN) framework is proposed to alleviate the above challenges. The multistage evolutionary GAN is a general framework and can be instantiated to existing evolutionary GAN and its variants. Moreover, this paper designs a two-stage and a three-stage evolutionary GAN methods. The two models show that different variation operators and evaluation methods can be used in different stages. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that the proposed methods are effective in capturing complex input signals and alleviating the model training problem. The proposed methods can greatly facilitate the application of image generation systems in consumer products.},

  abstract={English writing is a big challenge for the English as Foreign Language (EFL) learners due to the lack the lexical resources to inspire them for writing. However, we developed the mobile app, namely Smart UEnglish with the smart mechanisms by integrating multiple recognition technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) to help learners practice meaningful English writing in authentic contexts. Through the smart mechanisms like the integration of speech-to-text (STR), image-to-text recognition (ITR), and generative-AI, the learners could receive not only lexical resources but also sample sentences generated by AI (AI-GS) to inspire them to make meaningful writing. A total of 71 undergraduate students from two classes were assigned to two groups. The experimental group (EG) learns with Smart UEnglish including ITR, STR, and AI-GS. Meanwhile, the control group (CG) learns with ITR and STR only. The mix-method was used to analyze the study deeply. The results found that the EG outperformed the CG in the posttest. The ITR-generated texts as input for AI-GS could inspire the learners by giving the sample sentences before they write the essay. The use of ITR is the predictive variable in the post-test. In addition, the learners in EG have high positive perceptions towards Smart UEnglish. Hence, the integration of multiple recognition technologies and AI in the Smart UEnglish could facilitate EFL learners to learn meaningful writing in authentic contexts.},

  abstract={This research paper explores the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) techniques to create synthetic medical datasets that balance data realism and privacy preservation. The sensitivity of medical records poses challenges for data access and sharing, making GAI a promising solution. The study evaluates five key approaches—StyleGAN2, CLIP, T5, ViT, and specialized Tabular GANs—across three critical dimensions: distribution fidelity, attribute correlation preservation, and pattern recognition accuracy. The results reveal the strengths and limitations of each technique in generating realistic medical data. StyleGAN2, CLIP, and T5 excel in all dimensions, making them ideal for various applications requiring high-quality synthetic medical datasets. ViT shows promise but may need fine-tuning for specific use cases, while specialized Tabular GANs demonstrate potential but vary in performance. This comparative analysis provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners at the intersection of Generative AI and healthcare data generation. It underscores the potential of Generative AI in addressing the tabular data generation challenge in medical records, offering realistic and privacy-conscious alternatives for data utilization and model training.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) plays an imperative role in next-generation critical infrastructures like the smart grid, whose power can be harnessed by not only operators, but also cyber adversaries. This article investigates a potential threat from adversarial AI in blind false data injection attacks (FDIA) targeting the ac state estimators in the smart grid. Assuming no access to the grid topology required in most FDIA, we propose an adversarial model based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) to infer grid topology from historical measurements. Following the topology inference, a substitute bad data detector (BDD) model is further proposed in the attack model to filter the false data before injection, reducing the risk of detection given potential bad data in normal operations. We also refine the common evaluation of FDI stealthiness by including the presence of bad data among normal and false data when assessing the detection performance. Simulations on the IEEE 30-bus system reveal that significant deviations can be inflicted stealthily by the proposed blind FDI attack. Detailed analyses of the stealthiness, impacts, and parameters are also presented to shed more light on the threats for further studies and effective countermeasures.},

  abstract={The imbalanced dataset is a challenging issue in many classification tasks. Because it leads a machine learning algorithm to poor generalization and performance. The imbalanced dataset is characterized as having a huge difference between the number of samples that contain each class. Unfortunately, various resampling methods are proposed to solve this problem. In our work, we target enhancing the handling of the imbalanced dataset using a new oversampling technique based on generative adversarial neural networks. Our method is benchmarked against the widely used oversampling technique including the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), random oversampling technique (ROS), and the adaptive synthetic sampling approach(ADSYN). Additionally, three machine learning algorithms are used for evaluation. The outcome of our experiments on a real-world credit card dataset shows the strong ability of the proposed solution against the competitive oversampling techniques to overcome the imbalanced problem in the European credit card dataset.},

  abstract={In this paper, we use Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) method to generate more images with multiple views to increase our dataset diversity. We use 3D-model different views for training DCGAN to make interpolation between the leftest and rightest random vectors, which means it can generate leftest to rightest images. After producing many of multi-view images, we combine with CNN based modules called co-attention map generator to look for common features of the same class but in different views clothing. By applying the learned generator to all images, the corresponding co-attention maps are obtained. we can fluently apply the proposed method can function well for multi-view objects on different types of clothing classes.},

  abstract={This paper delves into the significance and interaction between deep learning (DL) and neural architecture search (NAS) within the realm of artificial intelligence. As DL has become integral in addressing complex problems through its robust learning capabilities, NAS offers the potential to autonomously discover efficient neural network structures. The fusion of these technologies not only enhances model performance but also accelerates the proliferation of AI applications, particularly in resource-constrained settings such as embedded devices and edge computing. This study provides an in-depth comparative analysis of multiple neural network models applied to the CIFAR-10 dataset, with a particular focus on the performance of the Darts-SEBnet model. By incorporating a self-attention mechanism, the Darts-SEBnet model demonstrates a significant improvement in accuracy over the baseline VGG16 model. Furthermore, the paper reviews the evolution of NAS, emphasizing the success of gradient-based search methods like DARTS and its variants in improving search efficiency and model performance. The findings suggest that the integration of DL and NAS could drive further innovations in AI, offering solutions to existing bottlenecks and expanding AI's applicability across diverse fields.},

  abstract={The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into innovation management has expanded into creative domains such as Design Thinking (DT), yet its role within complex, collaborative innovation frameworks remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by investigating how professionals perceive and utilize AI in DT workshops. Using affordance theory as a conceptual lens, we conducted observational studies and semi-structured interviews with DT experts to identify AI's action potentials, constraints, and mitigation strategies in this context. Our findings highlight four key affordances of AI in DT workshops: enhanced creativity, support for analytical tasks, facilitation of task initiation, and acceleration of processes. However, these benefits are tempered by challenges, including reduced team collaboration, diminished ownership of AI-generated outputs, and disruptions to workshop flow. The study reveals distinct human-AI interaction archetypes, underscoring the dynamic interplay between human expertise and AI capabilities. To mitigate constraints, we propose strategies such as pre-preparing AI-generated content, defining clear roles for AI and human inputs, and fostering collaborative reflection on AI outputs. By illuminating AI's potential and limitations within DT, this research contributes to the innovation management literature and offers actionable insights for practitioners seeking to integrate AI into hybrid innovation processes.},

  year={2024},
  volume={28},
  number={3},
  pages={1504-1515},
  abstract={Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a pervasive disorder affecting millions of individuals, presenting a significant global health concern. Functional connectivity (FC) derived from resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) serves as a crucial tool in revealing functional connectivity patterns associated with MDD, playing an essential role in precise diagnosis. However, the limited data availability of FC poses challenges for robust MDD diagnosis. To tackle this, some studies have employed Deep Neural Networks (DNN) architectures to construct Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic FC generation, but this tends to overlook the inherent topology characteristics of FC. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)-based Conditional GAN with Class-Aware Discriminator (GC-GAN). GC-GAN utilizes GCN in both the generator and discriminator to capture intricate FC patterns among brain regions, and the class-aware discriminator ensures the diversity and quality of the generated synthetic FC. Additionally, we introduce a topology refinement technique to enhance MDD diagnosis performance by optimizing the topology using the augmented FC dataset. Our framework was evaluated on publicly available rs-fMRI datasets, and the results demonstrate that GC-GAN outperforms existing methods. This indicates the superior potential of GCN in capturing intricate topology characteristics and generating high-fidelity synthetic FC, thus contributing to a more robust MDD diagnosis.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the emerging field of emotional engineering which takes the form of a marriage between generative artificial intelligence (AI) and emotional intelligence that is set to redefine the future of human-machine collaboration. With the latest advances in AI having allowed for broad understanding and generation of human-like emotional responses, this paper illuminates the frameworks for creating systems that are capable of empathizing with and responding to the emotions of human users that can be widely applied across domains such as healthcare and customer service. The findings here indicate that user experiences can be drastically improved through applications such as those which allow for machines to accompany emotional intelligence, as they can enable more empathetic interactions. Emotion AI isn’t about having "feelings" in the human sense — it’s more about accurate and relevant emotional interaction. There’s no doubt "emotional engineering" will spawn gadgets that are truly empathetic and not just intelligent, but it also raises large questions about what happens now that we must account for emotions in our digital interactions.},

  abstract={The success of artificial intelligence (AI) in multiple disciplines and vertical domains in recent years has promoted the evolution of mobile networking and the future Internet toward an AI-integrated Internet of Things (IoT) era. Nevertheless, most AI techniques rely on data generated by physical devices (e.g., mobile devices and network nodes) or specific applications (e.g., fitness trackers and mobile gaming). Therefore, generative AI (GAI), a.k.a. AI-generated content (AIGC), has emerged as a powerful AI paradigm; thanks to its ability to efficiently learn complex data distributions and generate synthetic data to represent the original data in various forms. This impressive feature is projected to transform the management of mobile networking and diversify the current services and applications provided. On this basis, this work presents a concise tutorial on the role of GAIs in mobile and wireless networking. In particular, this survey first provides the fundamentals of GAI and representative GAI models, serving as an essential preliminary to the understanding of GAI’s applications in mobile and wireless networking. Then, this work provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art studies and GAI applications in network management, wireless security, semantic communication, and lessons learned from the open literature. Finally, this work summarizes the current research on GAI for mobile and wireless networking by outlining important challenges that need to be resolved to facilitate the development and applicability of GAI in this edge-cutting area.},

  abstract={We present an artificial intelligence application system to improve the skills of excise and human health. Captured video images of human exercise are processed so that the images imitates the trainer's motion. We call such images "imitated motion images". We employed imitated motion images of a person to make it easier to imitate trainer's exercises skills by the person. As an experiment for the evaluation of imitated motion images, we performed experiments with our collaborators. Then, we asked the collaborators for their opinions about real and imitated motion images. The results suggest that the imitated motion images are more effective. Because manual processing to produce imitated motion images is too much work, the existing technology, Pose2Pose, is used. When we tested multiple motion images of multiple person, we confirmed that about half of the images could be processed automatically, and it was also confirmed that the effect on the improvement of skills was achieved.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) and edge intelligence (EI) are driving the evolution of traditional vehicular networks toward the intelligent Internet of Vehicles (IIoV) by providing foundational and personalized knowledge. However, their inherently contradictory characteristics present significant challenges to direct knowledge sharing. Furthermore, conventional methods that independently optimize fine-tuning and inference lack the foresight to achieve long-term network benefits. To address these challenges, we propose the GAI-oriented synthetic network (GaisNet), a collaborative cloud-edge-end intelligence framework that integrates fine-tuning and inference. GaisNet, specifically, can mitigate contradictions by leveraging data-free knowledge relays, where bidirectional knowledge flow facilitates a virtuous cycle of model fine-tuning and task inference with a long-term perspective, fostering mutualism between GAI and EI in the IIoV. A case study illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the future challenges and directions in the interplay between GAI and EI.},

Well-known applications include proactivity enhancements, marketing material generation, product development, digital (twin) customer service agents, supply chain routing and optimization, business decision-making, etc. The full rainbow of different pipelines, where GAI tools are used in multiple different steps, is well less studied and known. Especially those pipelines, which by nature, are producing more profound changes in organizational productivity, work quality, error reduction, and overall end customer experience enhancement fronts. In this context, our research focuses on examining and analyzing modern-day GAI applications, product and service generation, marketing and user/customer experience-related business pipelines, and current practices, across a range of domains, on extending current academic and practical use basis knowledge of different applications and uses of GAI in context of many different industrial application areas. We help build the current status quo overall picture of GAI utilization areas, from product design to marketing and user experience, by investigating methods and architectures employed and advancing the practical significance of each application.},

  title={Framework for Adoption of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in Education}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={67},
  number={5},
  pages={777-785},
  abstract={Contributions: An adoption framework to include generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in the university curriculum. It identifies and highlights the role of different stakeholders (university management, students, staff, etc.) during the adoption process. It also proposes an objective approach based upon an evaluation matrix to assess the success and outcome of the GenAI adoption. Background: Universities worldwide are debating and struggling with the adoption of GenAI in their curriculum. GenAI has impacted our perspective on traditional methods of academic integrity and the scholarship of teaching, learning, and research. Both the faculty and students are unsure about the approach in the absence of clear guidelines through the administration and regulators. This requires an established framework to define a process and articulate the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder involved. Research Questions: Whether the academic ecosystem requires a methodology to adopt GenAI into its curriculum? A systematic approach for the academic staff to ensure the students’ learning outcomes are met with the adoption of GenAI. How to measure and communicate the adoption of GenAI in the university setup? Methodology: The methodology employed in this study focuses on examining the university education system and assessing the opportunities and challenges related to incorporating GenAI in teaching and learning. Additionally, it identifies a gap and the absence of a comprehensive framework that obstructs the effective integration of GenAI within the academic environment. Findings: The literature survey results indicate the limited or no adoption of GenAI by the university, which further reflects the dilemma in the minds of different stakeholders. For the successful adoption of GenAI, a standard framework is proposed 1) for effective redesign of the course curriculum; 2) for enabling staff and students; and 3) to define an evaluation matrix to measure the effectiveness and success of the adoption process.},

  pages={25-29},
  abstract={This study examines how multimedia arts students perceive generative artificial intelligence (AI) as a potential threat to traditional artistic practices. While AI-powered tools are increasingly integrated into creative processes, offering benefits such as efficiency, expanded techniques, and access to new artistic possibilities, their use has sparked concerns about the declining role of manual skills and the authenticity of AI-generated works. Using Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovations Theory as a framework, this research explores student insights through qualitative analysis, including keyword frequency and word cloud visualization. Results indicate a generally positive attitude toward AI’s practical applications, yet students express reservations about its impact on creative identity, originality, and ethical considerations such as copyright and attribution. These findings suggest a need for educational approaches that introduce AI critically and constructively, ensuring that emerging technologies enhance rather than replace human creativity. Future research should explore pedagogical strategies that preserve traditional artistic values while preparing students to navigate an evolving creative landscape.},

  abstract={In recent years, with the rapid development of AI (Artificial Intelligence) technology, it has been increasingly utilized in the field of education. This paper takes the course of Human Resource Management for medical and health management majors as an example and discusses in some detail the potential and practical effectiveness of generative AI in enhancing the efficiency and quality of teaching in this course. This paper uses the case study method to explore the intelligent generation of knowledge points, personalized learning recommendation system, and intelligent homework correction of generative AI in classroom teaching. In addition, this paper evaluates the teaching effect of generative AI from various aspects, such as students’ learning effectiveness, participation, and satisfaction. Through the collection and analysis of relevant data, it is facilitated that generative AI can effectively improve students’ learning motivation and achievement and strengthen the implementation of classroom interaction and individual teaching. The study shows that generative AI can not only improve the quality and efficiency of teaching, but also continuously optimize teaching strategies through data-driven approaches, creating more value for both teachers and students. The case study found that students 001 and 003 were more engaged, as evidenced by the relatively high number of logins, forum postings, and project submissions, and accordingly, their satisfaction scores were higher, at 4 and 5, respectively. In conclusion, the application of generative AI technology in the teaching of Human Resource Management course for medical and health management majors demonstrates its broad prospect in the field of educational technology.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Since the introduction of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), education in computer science has prompted efforts to incorporate it into the educational curriculum. This innovative practice full paper presents a study into using GenAI to enhance student learning of software engineering. It outlines the initiatives to introduce GenAI into a graduate-level software engineering course in Software Verification and Validation (SV&V). The paper presents the educational goals, methodologies and findings of these endeavors in this course. The primary education goal of this course is that students have a solid understanding of principles and practices of software quality assurance and seek to introduce students to diverse techniques employed for SV&V. The study presented in this paper centers on the practical application of GenAI within the domain of testing strategies. The paper introduces the findings of an exercise where GenAI was used to apply testing strategies for unit testing. The exercise consisted of the use of GenAI in the development of unit tests for an algorithm. Rigorous assessments were conducted to gauge the effectiveness of the unit tests developed for validating the accurate implementation of the algorithm. This exploration shed light on the tangible impact of GenAI on the precision and efficiency of unit testing procedures. The findings underscore the significance of encouraging students to actively explore emerging trends and methodologies in the realm of software verification and validation. By incorporating GenAI into the educational framework, students not only gain insights into the capabilities and limitations of this technology but also foster a mindset of continuous learning in software quality assurance. The paper demonstrates that it is not sufficient to use the test cases developed by GenAI for software validation since test cases recommended by GenAI do not cover corner cases which causes gaps in coverage in unit testing. The majority of the students were able to understand the limitation of GenAI in SV&V but appreciated its support in suggesting test cases for the most common cases. This exercise allowed students to enhance their creative problem-solving through human-guided AI partnership which is pivotal in cultivating a new generation of professionals capable of contributing to the ongoing evolution of software quality.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={902-906},
  abstract={Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an agile software development approach. It promotes short cycles, composed of three phases each, to incrementally implement software functionality: Red, Green, and Refactor. In the Red Phase, the TDD developer writes a unit test for a small chunk of functionality not yet implemented and watches the test fail. In the Green Phase, the TDD developer writes production code to make the test pass as quickly as possible. Finally, in the refactor phase, the TDD developer “cleans” written code. In this demo paper, we present GAI4-TDD (Generative Artificial Intelligence for Test-Driven Development), a PyCharm plugin to support the Green Phase of TDD. Specifically, this plugin generates production code from the tests the TDD developer had written in the Red Phase so that the generated code makes these tests pass. Previous studies have shown that TDD can be beneficial not only in the “traditional” software development context but also in the Embedded Systems (ESs) development context. We preliminary assessed GAI4-TDD in the latter context through a laboratory empirical study on three ESs. We observed that in the greater part of the cases, GAI4- TDD generates production code that successfully implements the chunk of functionality required. A video showing GAI4- TDD in action is available at: https://youtu.be/30IDb-6NgS4.},

  abstract={Collective reflection is essential for pre-service science teachers' professional development which involves participants generating multiple ideas for their reflection exercises. However, current research revealed that it is a challenge for facilitating collective reflection due to its superficial cognition and intangible quality. Considering generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has been demonstrated to be able to help promote teachers' professional development in a large amount of existing research, this study integrated the ChatGPT 4.0 into preservice science teachers' collective reflection. Due to the dynamic and complicated process of collective reflection, Epistemic network analysis (ENA) approach was employed to trace the development process of 14 pre-service science teachers' collaborative discourse patterns in two collective reflection activities after micro-teaching and traditional classroom teaching. Data analysis results revealed that when the pre-service science teachers used ChatGPT in collective reflection, they demonstrated less active on providing critical feedback and analyzing the causes of problems combined pedagogical knowledge and classroom observation. Furthermore, the pre-service science teachers had different highlights in two collective reflection activities. Suggestions are provided to promote the pre-service science teachers' integrated GAI collective reflection.},

  abstract={This study examines the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and the work environment on the motivation of formal workers in DKI Jakarta Province. Using IBM SPSS 29 for data analysis, 402 formal workers participated via online questionnaires. Results indicate that GAI positively correlates with work motivation (regression coefficient=0.71, t = 10.98, p < 0.001). Likewise, a favourable work climate considerably boosts motivation (β = 0.63, t = 12.21, p < 0.001). Also, the work environment was found to have a significant indirect effect on the GAI-motivation relationship (β = 0.55, p < 0.001). The results of this research imply that the implementation of sophisticated AI technologies and a favourable organisational climate are the keys to increasing employees’ effectiveness and engagement. Despite the study’s short data collection period, the results are indicative. Strategic investments in GAI and improvements in the work environment could significantly enhance the motivation of Jakarta’s 3.08 million formal workers. This paper provides valuable insights into leveraging GAI and work environment factors to improve employee well-being in Jakarta’s dynamic work context.},

  pages={147-149},
  abstract={Literary studies critically examine fictional texts, exploring their structures, themes, stylistic features, and cultural-historical contexts. A central challenge in this field lies in bridging textual analysis with the spatial and sensory dimensions of settings described or implied in texts. Traditional methodologies often require scholars to mentally reconstruct these environments, leading to incomplete or inconsistent interpretations. Readers may be biased by their personal context or experiences, or may lack detailed knowledge of the relevant historical facts. This paper argues for the integration of virtual reality and generative artificial intelligence as supporting instruments to enhance literary research. The former enables immersive, spatially accurate reconstructions of historical environments, while the latter provides tools such as text-to-image and text-to-3D generation which let us dynamically render visual elements quoted in literary texts. Together, these technologies have the potential to significantly enhance traditional literature analysis methodologies, enabling novel approaches for contextualizing and analyzing literature in its spatial and cultural milieu.},

Deep Learning (DL), as a crucial technique for instilling intelligence into 6G, has demonstrated powerful and promising development. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the pivotal role of DL in 6G, exploring the myriad opportunities and challenges that arise. Firstly, we present a detailed vision for DL in 6G, emphasizing areas such as adaptive resource allocation, intelligent network management, robust signal processing, ubiquitous edge intelligence, and endogenous security. Secondly, this paper reviews how DL models leverage their unique learning capabilities to solve complex service demands in 6G. The models discussed include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Graph Neural Networks (GNN), Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Transformer, Federated Learning (FL), and Meta Learning. Additionally, we examine the specific challenges each DL model faces within the 6G context. Moreover, we delve into the rapidly evolving field of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), examining its development and impact within the 6G framework. Finally, this paper culminates in a detailed discussion of ten critical open problems in integrating DL with 6G, setting the stage for future research and development in this field.},

  abstract={In the digitalizing world, Artificial Intelligence (AI) paves the way for the automation of routine work done by humans and makes life easier. Recently, there is no area where AI and its applications are not used in daily life, from health to education, from transportation to energy, and from agriculture to tourism. AI applications are making rapid progress in the direction of important and current developments, especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL). A concrete example of progress in these areas is the GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) language model. AI-assisted GPT-3 technology is the DL model that is effectively used in many NLP fields, which can produce long and consistent content similar to the texts written by people using pre-trained algorithms. The GPT-3 architecture has reached a level that can compete with people in many areas by producing optimum solutions for all kinds of inputs by using the Transformer-based language model, which is an attention-based deep learning technique. This article aims to convey the efficiency, structure and potential of the Transformer-assisted GPT-3 model, which is one of the most up-to-date NLP technologies, to the reader. Since the number of Turkish studies in the field of GPT-3 AI is quite limited, it is considered that this study will contribute to the literature in terms of both quantity and quality. In addition, the performance parameters of the model were examined by making a customized fine-tuned sample application in the beta version of the GPT-3 model.},

  abstract={Multi-agent path planning is one of the most challenging problems in the field of artificial intelligence. In this paper, an improved generative adversarial network model with hybrid attention mechanism for data-driven path planning is proposed. Firstly, by introducing spatial attention mechanism, positional attention mechanism and channel attention mechanism, a hybrid attention module is designed. This module not only establishes feature relationship between different locations, but also provides adaptive feature weights to highlight key information. Next, by embedding the hybrid attention module into the generative adversarial network, an improved generative adversarial network model is developed. The proposed model can capture effective feature information in the image and ensures that the generated path can evade obstacles accurately. Finally, some simulation results are provided to verify the superiority and accuracy of the model in path planning.},

  abstract={Summary <p>In the world of artificial intelligence (AI), data acts as the vital force driving machine learning algorithms. Data lays the foundation for the construction of AI systems, and readers need a sufficient quality and quantity of data to make sure that their AI programs perform successfully. Data is the fuel that trains the AI to discern patterns and interpret the inputs provided. Generative AI's ability to automatically read unstructured data and classify it appropriately for future uses is an immensely powerful capability for companies. This chapter explores the importance of data and its collection, storage, and management. The success of using AI to propel marketing and business results directly depends on the quality of data that fuels the AI engines. Machine learning models require a sufficient amount of data to discern patterns and make accurate predictions. Data splitting is the process of dividing the data set into training, validation, and test sets.</p>},

  abstract={Deep learning is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that has grown quickly and is now widely used in computer software. As the need for deep learning algorithms that can handle more complicated tasks keeps growing very quickly, the improvements in how efficient and productive these algorithms can be utilized for identifying data poisoning is an important step. Data poisoning refers to altering the legitimate data using various techniques and fabricating the expected results. The poisoning will affect the quality of predictions and reliability of the contents generated. The data sensitive applications which rely on classification models for deriving conclusions will be affected by poisoning resulting in unrealistic conclusions and misguided inferences. Continuous occurrence of poorly classified data and unrealistic conclusions will affect the reliability of the system making it less trustworthy. This research looks into long lasting effects of poisoning attacks, which target the training data used in deep learning and assess the way a deep learning model classifies information. Experiments were done to measure the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms in effectively detecting poisoned data. The evaluations were done using KNN, SVM and Logistic Regression models. The analysis concludes that KNN offers better prediction compared to SVM and Logistic Regression. Logistic regression offers less accurate predictions making it unfit for poisoning detection. Proper classification of poisoned data will help research community and users to be aware of legitimacy of data and thereby help them to choose the right data and information for processing, analytics, and deriving conclusions. This will greatly improve the performance and trustworthiness of related models including generative AI systems and makes the learning process un biased which will highly benefit the research community in general.},

  abstract={The rapid rise in popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) with emerging capabilities has spurred public curiosity to evaluate and compare different LLMs, leading many researchers to propose their own LLM benchmarks. Noticing preliminary inadequacies in those benchmarks, we embarked on a study to critically assess 23 state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, using our novel unified evaluation framework through the lenses of people, process, and technology, under the pillars of benchmark functionality and integrity. Our research uncovered significant limitations, including biases, difficulties in measuring genuine reasoning, adaptability, implementation inconsistencies, prompt engineering complexity, evaluator diversity, and the overlooking of cultural and ideological norms in one comprehensive assessment. Our discussions emphasized the urgent need for standardized methodologies, regulatory certainties, and ethical guidelines in light of Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements, including advocating for an evolution from static benchmarks to dynamic behavioral profiling to accurately capture LLMs’ complex behaviors and potential risks. Our study highlighted the necessity for a paradigm shift in LLM evaluation methodologies, underlining the importance of collaborative efforts for the development of universally accepted benchmarks and the enhancement of AI systems’ integration into society.},

  abstract={Arabic calligraphy is one of the most aesthetic art forms in the world due to its variety and long history. However, generating calligraphic style is mainly done by human expert calligrapher (also known as Khattat) and has not been carried out by machine learning techniques. Generative adversarial networks (GAN) are deep learning tools that achieved outstanding results in the field of style transfer and generation. In this paper, various GAN architectures were investigated such as CycleGAN, Pix2pix, and deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN) within Arabic calligraphy in two aspects: generation and style transfer. The results show that CycleGAN can transfer skeleton letters to both Naskh and Thulth styles, Pix2Pix can denoise the calligraphy papers, and DCGAN can generate realistic Arabic calligraphy letters. The proposed approaches are applicable for other calligraphy styles besides Naskh and Thulth. Finally, the models are evaluated qualitatively using a preference judgment technique survey.},

  abstract={This paper deals with data pseudonymization when using generative artificial intelligence, specifically ChatGPT. The aim of the research was to experimentally verify whether ChatGPT can maintain the protection of pseudonymized data by not maintaining the link between the anonymized part and personal data. Four requests were tested in the experiment, in which ChatGPT was gradually provided with various combinations of pseudonymized and complete data about customers and their orders. The results showed that ChatGPT does not store previous inputs and is not able to reconstruct personal data retroactively if they were not explicitly provided to it in each request. Based on the results obtained, it can be assumed that the use of ChatGPT when processing pseudonymized data does not pose a risk of violating the protection of personal data. This research seeks to contribute to the discussion on the security of generative artificial intelligence in processing sensitive data and confirms the effectiveness of pseudonymization as a mechanism for protecting personal data.},

  number={},
  pages={149192-149205},
  abstract={In the context of the swift advancement and integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into the design realm, comprehending user acceptance of these advanced tools has emerged as a pivotal issue. The primary purpose of this research is to examine and understand the factors influencing user acceptance and behavioral intentions towards generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in the design field. To achieve this, this research delineates a multifaceted theoretical model, underpinned by an analysis of user behavioral intentions and their driving factors. The model encapsulates eight principal constructs: intention to continue use, self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, satisfaction, facilitating conditions, expectation confirmation, trust in technology, and social influence. An empirical examination of 13 related hypotheses was conducted. Utilizing data from 339 valid questionnaires, the outcomes of the structural equation modeling lent support to all posited hypotheses. The research delineates that users’ sustained intention to utilize generative AI technology is directly contingent upon factors such as perceived usefulness, satisfaction, self-efficacy, and trust in technology. Notably, perceived usefulness and self-efficacy are identified as pivotal determinants of satisfaction. Furthermore, social influence and expectation confirmation are found to augment perceived usefulness, while facilitating conditions to enhance both self-efficacy and expectation confirmation. These findings yield novel insights into the theory of user behavior, charting a course for the refinement of generative AI design tools. Such enhancements are aimed at fostering a more extensive application and acceptance of these tools in the relevant fields.},

  pages={521-529},
  abstract={It is still a great challenge for the visually impaired people to perceive their surroundings from a global perspective, which makes it difficult for them to interact with unfamiliar environments. The reason is that these conventional assisting devices only address the obstacle avoidance problem. They do not provide visually impaired people with a global perception of the surrounding environment. In this article, a new generative adversarial network (GAN) model is developed to effectively transform the ground images into the tactile signal, which can be displayed by an off-the-shelf vibration device. The algorithm module and the hardware are integrated into a portable device, which provides visually impaired people with effective surrounding perception capability. In addition, a visual-tactile cross-modal data set is constructed to train the proposed deep-learning architecture. Experimental results show that the proposed system can help visually impaired people sense the ground and bring a better traveling experience for them. Note to Practitioners—This article presents a portable device that provides tactile recognition assistance for visually impaired people. Such a technology can be extensively used in tactile mouse and white cane. The developed technology can be extensively used for various industrial applications, such as surrounding monitoring and manipulation. The proposed work demonstrates the promising ability of artificial intelligence in healthcare applications. The generated tactile signals are expected to be used in many human-centered systems, and we believe that our contribution is an important step toward the development of a more comprehensive assisting technology for visually impaired people.},

Therefore, knowing how these models work is vital to understanding the mechanisms of how AI tools are built. AI systems are built on algorithms that enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time. For machine learning to be effective, it needs the proper training data set. The model is built from machines that use algorithms to learn from the data provided. In supervised learning, algorithms learn from labeled data to make predictions or classifications. Unsupervised learning uses algorithms that find patterns or structures in unlabeled data. Discriminative AI seeks to classify and differentiate data, essentially learning the differences between different categories of data. Training generative AI models often involve unsupervised learning, enabling the model to digest and understand large amounts of text, images, or videos.</p>},

To address these obstacles, generative artificial intelligence has been harnessed to fuel a series of teaching reform initiatives, particularly within the realm of English for specific purposes. In order to cultivate greater enthusiasm and proficiency in writing among students, a quasi-experimental teaching study was conducted for a semester among undergraduate civil engineering students.

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={This study explored the efficacy of using ChatGPT, a generative AI application, in a sophomore-year undergraduate engineering electronics course focusing on students’ learning of fundamental concepts and circuit problem-solving. As a part of this study, a group of sophomore-year engineering students were assigned a set of electronics circuit problems to solve first using traditional methods, followed by repeating the process using ChatGPT. Their experience was captured in a questionnaire-based survey, which attempted to gauge the perceived efficacy of ChatGPT or similar generative AI in electronics circuit problem-solving against the traditional problem-solving method under five criteria: accuracy, efficiency, learning retention, user experience, and assistance in critical thinking, using a 5-scale evaluation method. Additionally, some open-ended questions were included in the study for a qualitative assessment of ChatGPT’s perceived efficacy. The outcome of this exploratory research prompted a critical examination of the application of generative AI and similar assistive tools in the electronics course. Through the qualitative assessment, this study also identified several potential factors contributing to the observed performance differences between traditional and AI-assisted learning and problem-solving. Results from this study highlighted ChatGPT’s inherent strengths in efficiency and speed, while frequently compromising accuracy by being prone to errors and misinformation. Participants also emphasized the human factor of learning and advocated for the active involvement of instructors in training students in the proper and effective use of AI and similar assistive tools. Insights from this study offer a nuanced understanding of the role of generative AI in engineering education, encouraging further research into optimizing the use of technology in the classroom.},

The methodology used for this journal will be conducted using Systematic Literature Review (SLR). The motivation for conducting SLR is to bridge the gap in understanding both the positive and negative implications of AI-generated art on the creative industry as a whole. Using tools like Publish or Perish and Mendeley, 69 relevant studies from 235 collected papers were analyzed using VOSviewer for visualizing key themes. The results show that AI influences job opportunities by streamlining production processes, disrupts copyright ownership through unauthorized data use, and transforms creative processes by enabling new ideation techniques while automating repetitive tasks. These insights highlight the dual-edged nature of AI in the creative industry and the need for ethical and legal frameworks to address its impacts.},

  title={The Impact of Generative AI-Supported Teacher Comments on Pre-service Teachers' Reflective Behavior Patterns in Microteaching}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={196-200},
  abstract={This study employs a quasi-experimental design to compare the effects of generative AI-supported teacher comments (experimental group) and traditional teacher comments (control group) on pre-service teachers' reflective behavior patterns in microteaching. Using lag sequence analysis, the study analyzes reflective behavior patterns based on 66 pre-service teachers' reflective texts on microteaching. The results indicate that generative AI-supported teacher comments significantly optimize pre-service teachers' reflective behavior patterns, particularly in terms of breadth and depth. The experimental group's reflective behaviors covered multiple dimensions, including teaching content (CW), teaching process and methods (PW), classroom atmosphere (AW), and teaching evaluation and feedback (EW), demonstrating comprehensiveness. Additionally, their reflective behaviors formed problem chains, such as "teaching content → teaching process → classroom atmosphere" (CW→PW→AW), reflecting stronger logic and depth. In contrast, the control group's reflective behaviors primarily focused on basic teaching skills (BW) and teaching process and methods (PW), with insufficient attention to classroom atmosphere (AW) and teaching evaluation and feedback (EW). Their reflections were more superficial and limited. Based on these findings, the study proposes recommendations to optimize pre-service teachers' reflective behavior patterns, aiming to enhance their microteaching reflection abilities and, consequently, their teaching competence development.},

  volume={},

  abstract={A zero-day exploit is an online attack using a previously unknown software or hardware weakness before its vulnerabilities can be tackled by its creators. A zero-day exploit could result in unauthorized access, information loss, and extensive financial gains. Recent works have investigated utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks in predicting and detecting zero-day exploits. In the adversarial process, the discriminator and generator refine detection. Studies conducted between 2022 and 2024 have proved the capability of such models in detecting vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, existing GAN based methods are confronted by various challenges, such as high cost, scalability issues, unstable training, and slow responsiveness to newly emerging exploit attacks, rendering real-time detection of threats less efficient. This project proposes an improved GAN architecture tackling such problems through a hybrid approach merging Conditional or Wasserstein GANs and Reinforcement Learning, Vulnerability Intelligence, Graph Neural Networks, and Autoencoders. This stabilizes training, minimizes computation overhead, and maximizes flexibility to new exploit methods. Our model, with this architecture, will be able to provide more precise detection of zero-day exploits, strengthening cybersecurity defenses beyond existing techniques. This method is designed to be adaptive and scalable so that it can provide long-term security against evolving cyber threats.},

  abstract={With the widespread adoption of smartphones over the past decade, mobile applications have become a primary target for malicious attacks, usually in the form of malware. Recent studies have leveraged artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for malware detection and classification. However, applying such approaches, particularly deep learning (DL) techniques, to mobile malware detection poses significant challenges. These challenges arise from the difficulty of collecting large quantities of mobile malware samples and the inherent class imbalance in the collected datasets. To tackle these issues and enhance the performance of machine learning (ML) and DL detection models, we propose novel detection models based on a generative adversarial network (GAN). Furthermore, our approach not only employs a conditional tabular GAN (CTGAN) for data augmentation to explore the impact of augmentation but also identifies the optimal multiplication factor for achieving the best results. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed data augmentation approach significantly improves the performance of mobile malware detection models, especially those based on DL. We have notably figured out that doubling the original dataset is sufficient to enhance the performance of ML models, whereas DL models require additional data to achieve optimal results. Hence, our proposed mechanism is an effective solution for improving mobile malware detection.},

  pages={31576-31588},
  abstract={Humans possess the remarkable capacity to comprehend narratives presented in text and subsequently conjure associated mental images through their imagination. This cognitive ability enhances their grasp of the content and augments their overall enjoyment. Consequently, the development of an automated system aimed at producing visually faithful images based on textual descriptions, often referred to as the text-to-image task, stands as a profoundly meaningful endeavor. For this reason, a variety of text-to-image generating artificial intelligences (AIs) have been devised until now. Nevertheless, the generative AIs introduced thus far encounter an issue wherein they struggle to uphold the coherence of input sentences, particularly when multiple sentences are provided. Within this paper, we present a remedy to this challenge through the application of prompt editing. Furthermore, our experimental results substantiate that our proposed solution more effectively preserves contextual coherence among the generated images in comparison to other preexisting generative artificial intelligence models. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves performance by at least 30 percent in terms of the similarity of the generated image and by 130 percent in terms of  $ROUGE_{recall}$ .},

  abstract={In the contemporary digital landscape, the exclusion of digital tools in higher education undermines the essence of learning and advancement. This research delves into the symbiotic relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) and education, advocating for the integration of cutting-edge AI language learning tools like ChatGPT to keep pace with innovation. Through innovative methods of integrating generative AI language models, this study proposes a hyperaware curriculum design, fostering a revamped teaching and learning environment. It suggests that by leveraging AI, education can prioritize real-world knowledge application. Rather than viewing education as a static endpoint, this research emphasizes an ongoing process of enlightenment. We propose to situate AI in education as a crucial aspect of multiliteracy pedagogical approach. Through the theoretical lens of the four crucial dimensions of multiliteracy pedagogy by New London Group (1996) including situated practice, overt instructions, critical framing, and transformed practice we postulate each dimension in the light of interweaving it with the integration of technology. As we move towards a future heavily reliant on AI, incorporating AI language models and digital tools into education is imperative.},

  abstract={Despite the advancements that have come out of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom and subsequent generative AI race, there are a significant number of problems under the surface. With the rise of AI generators in social media and pop culture, these problems amplify as the demand for AI tools skyrockets. These solutions regularly exhibit harmful biases and stereotypes deeply embedded in the data developers use to train AI models. Perhaps exacerbating the immediacy of the issue, generative AI models can create highly realistic imagery, empowering users with malicious intent. This paper explores the pervasive issue of bias in generative AI and its implications. It also examines how these models, often trained on biased datasets, can unintentionally amplify, replicate, and reinforce harmful biases and stereotypes. Additionally, it delves into the objectification of individuals, particularly women, and in a novel study, discusses how a popular TikTok filter that uses generative AI exhibits gender and racial biases while excessively sexualizing its users. While research on AI bias is forthcoming, existing literature referenced throughout this paper underscores its presence across various systems. This paper demonstrates the continued propagation of AI bias as these systems expand and iterate, often with inadequate mitigation efforts. It advocates for ethical considerations, accountability, and transparency in generative AI design and data selection. The Author proposes a novel framework called the Stereotypes, Objectification, Racism, and Datasets (SORD) Framework. The SORD Framework is proposed as a lens to examine the multifaceted dimensions of bias in generative AI. By critically analyzing these components, this paper aims to shed light on the ethical implications of biased generative AI, stimulate thoughtful discussions regarding responsible AI development, and provoke the lengthy process of removing bias from the systems and training datasets to eliminate AI bias at the source. Furthermore, it calls for collaboration among developers, researchers, and engineers to advance research, mitigate biases, and promote algorithmic fairness using the SORD Framework. Future work includes refining the SORD framework and assessing its effectiveness. Lastly, the Author underscores the pivotal role of engineering education in nurturing ethical AI practices, empowering future engineers to address societal challenges stemming from biased datasets and AI systems.},

  abstract={Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used as a vital tool for describing characteristics of information in the process of data mining and patterns. In data mining, an Anomaly Detection (AD) is an essential part which helps to determine behavior within the data and helps to detect network intrusion. The existing AD in network traffic has identified outliers in unbalanced datasets and difficult to train the model. Therefore, this paper introduces Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based on Minimax Loss Function for detecting anomalies in network traffic. Initially, this paper uses Neural Simulation Language-Knowledge Discovery in Databases (NSL-KDD) dataset which contains attacks and are preprocessed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality. After that, these features are processed using the Information Gain (IG) algorithm for eliminating irrelevant features and then anomalies are detected by the proposed GAN-Minimax loss function which effectively identifies outliers, handles imbalanced data and trains the model effectively. The proposed GAN-Minimax resulted in high accuracy as 99.92% when compared with existing K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method.},

This method is used to pre-trained models on large datasets and can be used for various tasks without requiring training from scratch. Training SR3 from scratch using the ImageNet dataset involves a complex process that requires substantial computational resources and expertise. The idea is applied the trained SR3 model to new images by feeding the low-resolution inputs and obtaining the high-resolution outputs. It's important to note that training SR3 from scratch is a resource-intensive process that requires powerful GPUs and significant computation time. If you do not have access to such resources, an alternative is to use pre-trained models that are already available and fine-tune them on specific datasets or tasks. The paper shows the result of comparing the resolution of the preprocessed images using a significantly smaller number of images to perform the training with those obtained using the pre-trained model. The results obtained show acceptable results without having to perform on large datasets minimizing the computation time to obtain the resolution of images.},

Some researchers have studied machine learning algorithms for categorizing earthquake vibrations. In this experiment, earthquake vibrations are categorized using the Artificial Neural Network method. We need appropriate datasets to obtain the maximum accuracy from the artificial neural network technique. The findings of this experiment show that feature extraction is required for the datasets to be trained to obtain a high accuracy value. The mean, median, maximum, minimum, skew, and kurtosis values are the feature that are extracted. In addition to employing feature extraction, it is crucial to modify the algorithm model. The experimental setup that uses “sigmoid” activation on the input layer, the three hidden layers, and the output layer yields the best accuracy when all feature are extracted, with training to test ratio of 90% to 10%. This is demonstrated by the exceptional training accuracy and testing accuracy values, which are 99.85 percent for training accuracy and 99.12 percent for validation accuracy. The mean value yields the highest accuracy result compared to employing just one feature extraction. Only 90.97 and 90.37 percent of training and validation accuracy are obtained when the mean is used alone for feature extraction.},

This study investigates the creation of AI agents that integrate state-of-the-art capabilities for decision-making and natural language interaction. Drawing on the fundamental concepts of AI agents, this research endeavors to enhance their functionality by seamlessly incorporating real-time Internet data into decision-making processes and implementing contextually aware conversation systems. The proposed AI agents were designed as independent entities capable of learning from data, making decisions, and executing actions without the need for direct human intervention. By leveraging language models (LLMs), these agents process vast amounts of data and continuously adapt and improve their performance over time. The integration of real-time Internet data enables agents to adjust their decision-making processes dynamically, ensuring prompt and well-informed responses to changing information. Contextually aware conversation systems empower these agents to engage in natural and personalized interactions, thereby fostering heightened user satisfaction and engagement. An intriguing aspect of AI agents is their capacity to learn and adapt to new situations without explicit programming in each unique scenario. Through continuous learning and interaction with the environment, AI agents have evolved to handle complex tasks efficiently and accurately. They can analyze patterns in large datasets, providing valuable insights and predictions across various industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation. This research underscores a commitment to innovation, addressing existing limitations in AI technology and exploring its potential to advance artificial intelligence in practical business applications.

  abstract={This paper has presented a case study in an undergraduate subject of Engineering Design, in which we implement the project-based learning (PBL) pedagogy and, in particular, introduce to students the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) technology, and encourage them to use such technology in their open projects as the assessment of relevant course. We use a typical case study of an interior design project, to demonstrate using the currently most popular AI technology, i.e. Stable Diffusion (SD), in classical engineering design. Working on this interior design project, various AI-based approaches have been implemented via SD, for a number of different interior design tasks. Results show that using SD with the state-of-the-art AI technology can generate expected design proposals very quickly and efficiently. Such project examples, under the PBL framework, whilst integrated with recent AI technology, can greatly motivate students’ learning and their performance.},

  abstract={In an era where technology plays a significant role in the lives of people of all ages, adapting to rapidly advancing technology is essential. Lifelong learning, which integrates formal, non-formal, and informal education, helps learners develop skills and abilities independently. Programming skills serve as an example of lifelong learning, requiring the development of technical skills such as programming, planning, and testing, as well as communication, teamwork, and systematic thinking. This research focuses on utilizing Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) to enhance programming skills through self-directed learning combined with interactive learning. The study was conducted with 21 students enrolled in the Higher Vocational Certificate (Diploma) program in Mechatronics and Robotics. The study applied the MAR model, which consists of three stages: The motivation stage, is designed to encourage learners to engage in activities that link prior knowledge or experiences with new knowledge, thereby fostering self-directed learning motivation, such as designing personalized learning activities based on individual interests; the Activity stage, which provides opportunities for learners to use Generative AI technology for self-directed learning according to their goals and plans, enabling them to understand concepts, apply knowledge in various situations, and track their learning progress; and the Reflection and Progress stage, focusing on reviewing, analyzing, and reflecting on learning outcomes, as well as exchanging ideas and skills with peers and receiving constructive feedback. These stages were designed based on theoretical foundations and a literature review. Furthermore, the research emphasized ethical considerations in AI use, such as data privacy and societal impacts, to promote high-quality, beneficial lifelong learning. The findings showed that before the learning process, the learner had no background in programming and had never used AI technology. However, after participating in the learning activities, students became more open to learning and responded positively to the self-designed activities, which aligned with their interests and skills related to their field of study. These findings suggest that this learning process, when implemented effectively, can be applied to lifelong learning for individuals of all genders and ages.},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Formative assessment can be a powerful approach in influencing student mathematical motivation, and the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers more possibilities to do so, especially when using feedback for formative assessment. Nonetheless, the literature review of this study found limited development and research on investigating the impact of using generative AI-based formative feedback on student mathematical motivation. Therefore, this study examined the impact of implementing Class Optimization Master, generative AI-based formative feedback software, in promoting student mathematical motivation. The study employed a case study on fourth-grade students in a primary school in China. Semi-structured interviews with 21 students and two teachers were conducted face-to-face. Then, the interview data were analyzed by thematic analysis based on the three-dimensions theoretical framework of Mathematical Motivation Scale: Beliefs, Engagement, and Attitude. This study found that the use of AI-generated formative feedback enhanced student mathematical motivation by (1) boosting confidence, promoting socio-emotional interaction, and raising the importance of mathematics; (2) rewarding and inspiring a preference for mathematics; and (3) stimulating interest and mental-physical effort. These results provide insights for educators to design how to make use of AI-generated formative feedback to promote mathematical learning. It nonetheless calls for more research using quantitative methods and from different perspectives on this topic.},

  abstract={With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), its application in educational settings has increasingly become a focal point, particularly in enhancing students’ analytical capabilities. This study examines the effectiveness of the ChatGPT prompt framework in improving text analysis skills among students, specifically targeting readability, accuracy, completeness, logicality, and critical thinking. Conducted among high school students in Canada, the research assesses how GAI prompt frameworks significantly affect the quality of students’ analytical responses. Results showed significant improvements in all five aspects of readability, accuracy, completeness, logicality, and critical thinking, especially for students with no prior knowledge of the topic. However, enhancements in completeness and critical thinking were less pronounced, suggesting that while the ChatGPT framework substantially supports basic analytical skills, its effectiveness varies depending on the complexity of cognitive tasks and the extent of students’ existing knowledge. The study underscores the significant role that advanced GAI tools can play in modern educational environments, promoting deeper engagement with learning materials and enhancing students’ analytical abilities. It highlights the necessity of integrating these technologies to cater to diverse learning needs and cognitive challenges.},

  abstract={Generative AI is a new and rapidly developing field of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new data or content. Although the concept of generating content was invented long back, the latest breakthroughs in neural network architectures have made it possible to implement this concept at a much faster pace. With the availability of vast amounts of data and computational power, it has become increasingly feasible. Generative models aim to generate new data resembling the training data distribution by learning its underlying patterns. They capture the inherent complexity of the data to produce outputs similar to the training examples. Discriminative models, on the other hand, focus on learning boundaries between different classes or categories within the data. The maritime industry is a major contributor to the global economy, but it is also a high-risk industry, as it is exposed to a variety of hazards. Generative AI can be used to improve maritime safety and efficiency in several ways. Although the maritime industry is still in the early stages of adopting generative AI, the potential benefits are significant. The integration of generative AI into maritime operations plays an increasingly important role in the maritime industry. In this view, this paper discusses generative AI, its technology, various applications, and key challenges and research prospectives.},
