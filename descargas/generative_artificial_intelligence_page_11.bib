  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has become an effective instrument capable of creating realistic content on its own in a variety of fields. GAI's growing adoption raises concerns about potential misuse for cyber threats, such as creating, convincing, phishing emails, producing deep fake videos and distributing false information through posts that appear to be genuine on social media. This is accurate even though its potential uses in data synthesis, virtual assistants, content development and the creative arts are exciting. These difficulties appeal for a careful analysis of GAI's place in cybersecurity (CS). This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the possible threats connected to the offensive GAI technique used in the Cyber Kill Chain (CKC) framework. In addition, our proposal includes defense tactics that leverage GAI capabilities. These strategies include the areas of detection, deception and adversarial training, with the aim of reducing the potential risks associated with cyber threats induced by GAI. Threat actors employ the use of GAI to augment Evasion, obfuscation and deception techniques, hence increasing the effectiveness and difficulty of detecting their attacks. This study highlights the importance of using proactive defense measures. The dual capability of GAI for legal and illegal usage highlights the need to comprehend and mitigate its influence inside the CKC framework. To combat the evolving gamut of GAI-induced cyber threats, organizations should employ attack-aware and adaptable GAI-enabled defense strategies.},

While effective, these methods are time-consuming and costly. With the advent of generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI), data conversion has been revolutionized, significantly reducing manual intervention. Traditional methods, often labor-intensive and costly, are replaced by automated Gen AI solutions. This innovation not only reduces technical effort and business involvement but also accelerates project timelines and lowers costs. This article explores the implementation of a Gen AI-driven solution that automates data extraction, validation, and mapping, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. Utilizing advanced technologies, such as SQL, Python pandas, and PyTorch, this approach reimagines the workflow, enabling faster and more reliable ERP implementations with minimal disruption. By harnessing the power of machine learning and neural networks, the system evolves continuously, offering a scalable and robust solution for modern enterprises navigating the complexities of digital transformation.

  abstract={Staff expenses can account for up to 70% of business costs, with indoor conditions playing a critical role in employee health, behavior, and productivity. Optimal thermal comfort, typically around 21°C with 40-70% humidity, maximizes productivity. However, effective monitoring requires comprehensive data, particularly as energy regulations push for smarter building management. Although Building Information Modeling (BIM, a digital representation of a building's physical and functional characteristics) and sensor integration support facilities management, many existing systems are proprietary, expensive, and inflexible. To address these challenges, this study introduces ThermalComfortBot, a sustainable Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)-powered Chatbot designed as an advanced Information System (IS). Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs, AI models for natural language understanding) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG, a method that combines data retrieval with LLMs-generated insights), ThermalComfortBot integrates data from BIM, sensors, and other relevant sources. Built on open-source technology, it is cost-effective and fully customizable, allowing users to tailor datasets to their needs. The Chatbot delivers actionable insights through a Question-Answering (QA) interface, enabling data-driven decisions on thermal comfort to improve workplace conditions and enhance operational efficiency.},

  abstract={The aviation business encounters difficulties in correctly and swiftly predicting flight fares due to the dynamic nature of the sector. Factors such as variations in demand, fuel costs, and the intricacies of various routes have an impact on this. This work presents a new method to tackle this issue by utilizing generative artificial intelligence (GAI) approaches to accurately forecast airfares in real-time. This paper presents a novel framework that integrates generative models, deep learning architectures, and historical pricing data to improve the precision of future flight price predictions. The study employs a GAI within a cutting-edge web engineering framework. This approach is designed primarily to gather knowledge about complex patterns and relationships present in historical airline data. Through the utilization of this methodology, the model is able to accurately perceive complex connections and adjust to ever-changing market conditions. Our model utilizes deep neural networks to effectively handle various circumstances and extract vital information, so facilitating a comprehensive comprehension of the intricate elements that impact flight cost. Moreover, the suggested approach places significant emphasis on precisely predicting upcoming occurrences in real-time, facilitating prompt reactions to market volatility and offering a valuable resource for airlines, travel agents, and customers alike. In order to enhance the accuracy of real-time forecasts, we utilize a web-based platform that allows for smooth interaction with live data streams and guarantees swift updates. The results demonstrate the model's capacity to adjust to dynamic market conditions, rendering it an attractive option for stakeholders in search of precise and current forecasts of flight prices.},

  number={},
  pages={66-70},
  abstract={Shared parking optimizes available parking spaces by allowing private owners like in residential areas such as condominiums, hotels, apartments and private garage, to rent out their parking spots during times when they are unoccupied1. The concept of shared parking allows drivers – residents and visitors - avoid the long search for an unoccupied parking space while also allowing the space owners to earn passive income by renting out their owned spots during times when they’re not using them. This allows them to monetize an underutilized asset and promotes sharing economy strategy. Especially in big cities like in Metro Manila, motorists spent 24 minutes every day searching for parking on average2, where 37% of the cars in congested traffic were cruising for parking for an average of 20 minutes. This shared parking platform aims to mitigate the challenge of long search for an unoccupied residential parking space, limited parking facilities, and time-consuming property approval and payment process, providing drivers with more accessible and affordable options while reducing the daily time spent searching for parking. This platform will enable residential parking owners to rent out their parking spaces to residents/drivers who are in need of a convenient and well-priced parking space for a couple of hours, days or longer period. This case study aims to explore the development and implementation of this platform – both web and mobile – that leverages Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and user-centric design to revolutionize the parking experience, fostering a more sustainable and streamlined approach to sharing economy. The business model focuses on a commission-based revenue approach, ensuring revenue potential and scalability.},

  abstract={This paper aims to explore how AIGC (Generative Artificial Intelligence) drives innovation in digital media content creation and proposes a new content generation framework based on Generative Multiple Adversarial steganography (GMASS). By integrating advanced machine learning models, the framework enables efficient generation and editing of image, video and audio content, while ensuring content security and privacy. Firstly, this paper summarizes the basic principle of AIGC and its application in the field of digital media, and points out its potential in improving creative efficiency and reducing production cost. Then, aiming at the challenges of the existing content generation technology in privacy disclosure and copyright infringement, the GMASS algorithm is proposed. The algorithm makes use of the characteristics of adversarial network to generate content and embed an imperceptible information hiding layer to effectively prevent unauthorized copying and tampering. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework, detailed system modeling and simulation experiments are carried out in this paper. The experimental results show that the GMASS algorithm can significantly improve the content security while maintaining the quality of the generated content. In addition, by comparing with traditional steganography techniques, GMASS's superior performance in resisting various attack methods and media content generation frameworks is demonstrated.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving significant breakthroughs in computer vision and image processing. However, there are still many challenges in rendering complex scenes, particularly generating and controlling images for extreme weather conditions. In this work, we propose a novel generative model based on ControlNet and achieve precise control and high-quality rendering of extreme weather features by combining a sparsely connected Squeeze-and-Excitation module with a zero-convolution design. The proposed model excels in generating highly realistic extreme weather scenes, including heavy rain and snow, while significantly enhancing the ability to fine-tune weather characteristic parameters. Experimental results validate the model's exceptional generation quality and robust control stability, which not only realistically reproduces complex weather scenes but also allows flexible adjustments to weather characteristics such as rainfall intensity, snowflake density, and flame range. Compared to previous methods, the model demonstrates substantial improvements in image detail fidelity, weather feature consistency and generation efficiency.

  title={A New Strategy to Reduce Design Fixation: Presenting Virtual Model Text to Designers in a Mixed Sequential Manner}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={79-83},
  abstract={Design fixation refers to the phenomenon where designers adhere to a limited set of ideas during the design process, thereby hindering innovation. Utilizing various types of stimulus materials is considered a significant method to alleviate design fixation. With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence technologies, designers can efficiently access a variety of inspirational stimulus materials. However, research on how to best combine multiple types of stimulus materials to mitigate design fixation is sparse. This study combined two types of stimulus materials—text and virtual models—and experimentally explored the impact of stimulus timing (synchronous, virtual model before text, and text before virtual model) and combination forms (matching and mixed) on design fixation. The results indicate that presenting the physical model before the text in a mixed sequential manner effectively alleviates design fixation.},

  abstract={Wildfires are a growing global concern, causing significant damage to urban infrastructure each year. This study presents a novel approach for building damage assessment using generative artificial intelligence, focusing on the transferability of high-resolution satellite imagery models to lower-resolution datasets. Our diffusion-based model is trained on the xView2 Wildfire Building Damage Benchmark, a dataset specifically designed for wildfire-induced building damage detection. The model is further evaluated on real-world wildfire incidents in Lahaina, Hawaii, and Athens, Greece, demonstrating its effectiveness in damage localization across varying spatial resolutions. With competitive performance on benchmark datasets and practical utility in real-world scenarios, this work highlights the potential of generative AI for geospatial disaster assessment and urban resilience.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has the potential to improve learning outcomes, which has aroused great interest in the field of education. However, few studies have explored the relationship between learning motivation, GAI technology acceptance, and learning outcomes. A total of 313 pre-service teachers were recruited at N Normal University in China. Questionnaire methods were used for data collection. The results of the structural equation show that: (1) GAI technology acceptance significantly predicted the learning outcomes, while the GAI use behavior did not. (2) Intrinsic motivation significantly predicted the GAI technology acceptance, while extrinsic motivation did not. (3) GAI technology acceptance plays a mediating role between the relationship of intrinsic motivation and learning outcomes. Based on the results of this study, some suggestions were put forward to improve the learning outcomes of pre-service teachers using GAI technology.},

  abstract={This study examines the potential of the LEGO® Serious Play® (LSP) method, augmented with generative artificial intelligence (AI), to facilitate introspection and its application across various settings. Employing a novel approach, we integrate LSP with transcription and generative AI to conduct one-on-one interviews aimed at extracting and analyzing introspective insights from participants. Our comparative analysis focuses on the effectiveness of this integrated method against conventional interview techniques, particularly in revealing less consciously acknowledged aspects of personality. The findings indicate that the use of LSP in combination with AI technologies provides a unique avenue for uncovering deeper, often subconscious, personal insights, as demonstrated by a distinctive pattern in the recognition of extracted keywords between methods. This research highlights the value of blending analog and digital methodologies to access and apply introspective data, offering significant implications for enhancing personal development and understanding.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) can increase the impact of digital marketing. By adopting Gen AI, marketers can create dynamic content tailoring to personalized strategies to optimize customer interactions, which increases engagement and sales. Despite challenges such as data privacy concerns and the potential loss of human interaction, the advantages of Gen AI in boosting customer engagement are substantial. Therefore, we did a systematic literature review using the PRISMA methodology to reveal how Gen AI improves digital marketing. The review highlights the role of gen AI in digital marketing and how it affects the tools marketers use in marketing. The urgency of adapting gen AI in digital marketing is to gain a benefit over competitors and tackle the challenges. Based on Bowden’s customer engagement framework, our findings reveal that Gen AI significantly impacts customer delight and affective commitment, which are critical components of long-term customer loyalty. Additionally, this review examines how gen AI increases customer engagement by affecting their environments and manipulating the tools integrated by AI to increase the likelihood of customer delight and affective commitment.},
