  abstract = {The development and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) have brought numerous problems and potential threats, such as information cocoons, algorithmic collusion, algorithmic bias and privacy, issues. To combat these issues, governments all over the world, international organizations and giant tech companies all have taken actions and reached an agreement that AI should be trusted. However, there is no uniform definition on trusted AI. In the paper, we make a survey on related works on artificial intelligence principles and ethical guidelines. Then analyze the ethical foundations of trusted AI and give a definition on trusted AI. We propose specific requirements of trusted AI from a technical perspective and give explanations on these technique requirements. Finally, best practices are recommended to achieve trusted AI and promote the responsible use of AI.},

  abstract = {<p>Defining Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not easy as AI is a young discipline. However, the field of AI got officially defined in 1956 with a workshop organized by John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project. The goal of this conference was to investigate ways in which machines could be made to simulate aspects of intelligence. In 1965, computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA, an early conversational AI program capable of natural language interaction. Though intended to showcase the superficiality of communication between humans and artificial intelligence, ELIZA's uncannily human&#x2010;like responses led many to curiously anthropomorphize its underlying system. The possibility to use massive volumes of data changed everything and triggered a new boom supported by the Big Data era, the access to large amounts of data, cheaper and faster computers, and progress on machine learning.</p>},

  title = {Cybersecurity Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence: A Novel Proactive and Collaborative Learning Paradigm},
  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Education},

  pages = {395-404},
  abstract = {Contribution: A novel proactive and collaborative learning paradigm was proposed to engage learners with different backgrounds and enable effective retention and transfer of the multidisciplinary artificial intelligence (AI)-cybersecurity knowledge. Specifically, the proposed learning paradigm contains: 1) an immersive learning environment to motivate the students for exploring AI/ machine learning (ML) development in the context of real-world cybersecurity scenarios by constructing learning models with tangible objects and 2) a proactive education paradigm designed with the use of collaborative learning activities based on game-based learning and social constructivism. Background: Increasing evidence shows that AI techniques can be manipulated, evaded, and misled, which can result in new and profound security implications. There is an education and training gap to foster a qualified cyber-workforce that understands the usefulness, limitations, and best practices of AI technologies in the cybersecurity domain. Efforts have been made to incorporate a comprehensive curriculum to meet the demand. There still remain essential challenges for effectively educating students on the interaction of AI and cybersecurity. Intended Outcomes: A novel proactive and collaborative learning paradigm is proposed to educate and train a qualified cyber-workforce in this new era where security breaches, privacy violations, and AI have become commonplace. Application Design: The development of this learning paradigm is grounded in the pedagogical approaches of technology-mediated learning and social constructivism. Findings: Although the research work is still ongoing, the prototype learning paradigm has shown encouraging results in promoting the learnersâ€™ engagement in applied AI learning.},
