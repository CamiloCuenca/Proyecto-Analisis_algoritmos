  abstract={With the continuous improvement of China’s economic level, the scale of the power grid is also increasing, and it is developing towards high voltage, high current, and large capacity, which has led to a sharp increase in the probability of power sensor signal interference. This article first presents the general factors of signal interference in power sensors, and uses optoelectronic coupling isolation measures and twisted pair shielded wire long line transmission signals to design anti-interference signal transmission channels. This article regards the monitored equipment as a dynamic linear system and establishes an anti-interference system for power sensor signals using state space equations. In response to the weak temporal and spatial correlation of data collected by each node in power sensors, the GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) algorithm is used to filter a series of power sensor nodes. In the comparison of RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and PSNR (Peak Signalto-Noise Ratio) of different algorithms, the RMSE (raw signal) of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is 0.23 and the RMSE (anti-interference signal) is 0.18. The PSNR (original signal) of GAN is 14.56, and the PSNR (anti-interference signal) is 17.89. The artificial intelligence based anti-interference system for power sensor signals helps to provide early warning for some anomalies, thereby improving the anti-interference ability of power sensor signals.},

  abstract={In the era of Artificial Intelligence and specifically in the sub-category of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenIA), the trend in the context of Data Centers is to be able to integrate traditional network architectures that are still managed as Ethernet networks with new ones. GenIA-based network structures that use low latency protocols such as InfiniBand and that allow parallel processing. In this work, a novel network architecture is presented that integrates the relevant aspects of Ethernet networks and the new GenIA Back End networks. We also deal with aspects related to protocols, bandwidth, design of a GenIA network architecture, components of GenIA networks and cooling systems. The main objective of this article is to analyze, through the Radial Basic Function (RBF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) algorithms, which are part of the scope of Neural Networks (NN), how the dependent variable or metric GPU Performance behaves, since it is one of the critical aspects in the middle of modern data center architectures. To achieve this, a series of independent variables are defined such as GPU Memory Access, Memory Bandwidth, Throughput, Power Consumption, Temperature, and Clock Speed. With the RBF algorithm, these sub-metrics are analyzed taking into consideration the number of units that may be in each of the hidden layers and the level of importance of the variable, while, with the MLP, the number of units established both in hidden layer 1 and 2, respectively, and the importance level and normalized importance to analyze the behavior of these sub-metrics. The latter is presented through case studies and helps to identify which metrics are more relevant than others in terms of operation, performance, and efficiency of GPU performance metrics.},

  pages={87621-87639},
  abstract={The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in interior design has revolutionized how spaces are conceptualized, visualized, and classified. As digital tools and generative design models become increasingly sophisticated, distinguishing between AI-generated and real-world interior design images has emerged as a critical challenge. This classification is essential for ensuring authenticity in design visualization, improving recommendation systems, and enhancing virtual and augmented reality applications in architectural planning. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to be highly effective in image classification tasks due to their ability to learn complex spatial hierarchies, making them particularly well-suited for differentiating between AI-rendered and real interior spaces. However, recent advancements in deep learning, including hybrid AI models and transformer-based vision networks, have further enhanced classification accuracy by integrating multimodal learning techniques. This study explores the use of advanced pre-trained CNN models, including DenseNet, RegNet, and SqueezeNet architecture, to classify interior design images. By leveraging a proprietary dataset composed of diverse AI-generated and real-world interior designs, our model achieved a peak classification accuracy of 97%, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional deep learning techniques. Additionally, we introduce a novel image preprocessing technique that enhances feature extraction by adjusting lighting, texture, and noise levels, thereby reducing discrepancies between AI-rendered and real images. The results indicate that AI approaches, CNNs, hold immense potential for further improving classification robustness. This study contributes to the growing field of AI-driven interior design classification by presenting a high-accuracy model capable of distinguishing between real and AI-generated environments with unprecedented precision.},

  abstract={The purpose of the study is to explore the applications of AI / ML in the field of culinary, especially new recipe generation from the existing ones. The paper presents a thorough background study in the AI/ML field of culinary and the existing applications in the recipe generation domain. Authors came across various recipe recommendations, cocktail generators, and cuisine-specific recommendations. However, none focused on Indian Recipe Generation, which could be a new field to explore. Therefore, the authors attempt to employ a working model that generates unique, non-existing cuisine- centric recipes for users to eat with a specific focus on Indian Cuisine. Using the Autochef algorithm [1], authors generated a series of generations of recipes supported by mutation and similarity. The process included dataset cleaning, preprocessing, and developing a generalized structure for recipes that can be fitted to a model. Finally, the authors train the model to generate Indian Recipes with the dynamics of artificial intelligence and the acceptance of AI-generated new recipes found among the Indian Diaspora.},

The ineffectiveness of standard air defence systems against tiny, sluggish, low-flying UAVs has been acknowledged in the National Counter Rogue Drone Guidelines. Due to their various sizes, flying characteristics, capabilities, performance parameters, missions, and weaknesses, the growing drone threats are challenging to fight.

  abstract={In today's society, even though the technology is so developed, the coloring of computer images has remained at the manual stage. As a carrier of human culture and art, film has existed in our history for hundred years. With the development of science and technology, movies have developed from the simple black-and-white film era to the current digital age. There is a very complicated process for coloring old movies. Aside from the traditional hand-painting techniques, the most common method is to use post-processing software for coloring movie frames. This kind of operation requires extraordinary skills, patience and aesthetics, which is a great test for the operator. In recent years, the extensive use of machine learning and neural networks has made it possible for computers to intelligently process images. Since 2016, various types of generative adversarial networks models have been proposed to make deep learning shine in the fields of image style transfer, image coloring, and image style change. In this case, the experiment uses the generative adversarial networks principle to process pictures and videos to realize the automatic rendering of old documentary movies.},

In this paper, we propose a generative framework for image fusion of the optical and infrared images. This framework is composed by a hierarchical generative adversarial network (GAN) including one generator and two discriminators. Different to the existing fusion method, we design a two-channel encoder for better fusion performance. Specifically, the intensity of the optical image is extracted and fed into an encoder, which is then integrated with the infrared image. In this way, the proposed framework is capable of learning the mutual knowledge between the optical and infrared images in terms of the intensity distribution. Extensive simulations on two datasets evaluate that the proposed method achieves significantly better performance than the existing approaches in terms of PSNR, RMSE and SSIM score, as well as the visualization results.},

  abstract={Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has made remarkable progress in a range of domains. However, its inherent random exploration mechanism leads to low efficiency, especially in complex environments where the time complexity of strategy exploration is high. To overcome this challenge, we propose a Deep Q-Learning based on the Generative Adversarial Model algorithm (DQN-GAN), aiming to improve exploration efficiency in deep reinforcement learning. The core of the DQN-GAN algorithm is to generate more diverse actions, thereby effectively simplifying the complex exploration process. Specifically, the proposed algorithm utilizes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to train a generator that generates diverse actions, enriching the exploration space. Meanwhile, a discriminator is trained with real demonstration data to ensure that the generated actions are highly consistent with actual data. Experimental data demonstrates that the integration of GAN into deep Q-learning exhibits significant performance improvements in OpenAI Gym environments. The proposed algorithm not only optimizes the exploration process but also enhances learning efficiency.},

  abstract={The Erasmus+ Ethical Engineer project aims to enhance AI education by integrating ethical, social, and legal aspects into engineering training, promoting truthful AI in Europe. In the paper, we present the explored case studies and the methodology for their development. AI ethics is explored through the following case studies. AI in healthcare is examined through fall detection systems for vulnerable populations, the potential for data bias in personalized medical devices, and the ethical implications of off-label device use, such as continuous artificial hearts. The use of AI in witness testimonies is considered through the example of the AIWitness chatbot designed to automate witness statements. Ethical considerations surrounding facial recognition are explored in the context of airport boarding, using a hypothetical scenario based on Brighton International Airport's pilot program, FaceBoard. The project also considers self-driving taxis' ethical and practical implications, using a hypothetical scenario in San Francisco. The ecological impact of generative AI is analyzed, referencing studies from Stanford University on energy consumption and water usage for cooling systems. The ethical challenges of AI in marketing processes are addressed, including the generation of content like text, images, and voice, along with concerns about job displacement, fake content creation, and authorship issues. The use of AI in assessing historic photos is examined, focusing on selection bias, the potential for surfacing insulting content, the need for transparency, and the potential prioritization of profit over ethical considerations. Finally, the paper addresses the pervasive issue of bias in data, particularly within the field of data science. The main contribution of the paper is the development of a structured template for creating AI ethics case studies, which we already tested with smaller groups of teachers and students and refined based on their feedback.},

  abstract={To address the challenges of high variable dimensionality and complex spatiotemporal characteristics in monthly source-load power modeling, this paper proposes a temporal generative adversarial network-based framework for monthly source-load scenario generation. Firstly, an RV coefficient-based clustering technique is employed to extract representative daily states of the source-load profiles, while a Markov chain is used to characterize the state transition patterns of the source-load. Then, a temporal generative adversarial network is constructed by incorporating multi-head attention mechanisms and temporal convolutional networks, aiming to capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations of intraday source-load power. Furthermore, a monthly source-load power scenario generation method is developed using stochastic techniques. Finally, the generated source-load scenarios are evaluated using a comprehensive evaluation index system.},

  abstract={This paper examines the role of generative artificial intelligence (AI), in influencing employee well-being within the hospitality industry. Drawing upon the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model, the study delves into how diverse job demands and resources affect the well-being of hotel frontliners, while also testing the moderating influence of generative AI on this relationship. Employing an online survey methodology, primary data were gathered from 220 frontliners working in selected hotels in Makassar, Indonesia. The findings reveal a significant negative impact of job demands on employee well-being, underscoring the adverse effects of factors such as workload, time pressure, and emotional demands on hotel frontliners. Conversely, job resources are found to have a positive and significant influence on employee well-being, emphasizing the pivotal role of supportive factors such as autonomy, social support, and opportunities for skill development in enhancing well-being. Moreover, the study identifies generative AI as a noteworthy moderator in this context. These findings hold implications for both theoretical understanding and practical applications in human resource management within the hospitality industry. As the hospitality sector continues to integrate AI technologies, prioritizing employee well-being emerges as a critical factor in sustaining a motivated and productive workforce.},

  pages={518-522},
  abstract={In recent years, Generative AI has emerged as a rapidly evolving tool in visual art, enabling quick image creation and flexible editing capabilities. These tools can produce striking visuals in a short amount of time and at significantly lower costs than human artists, making them accessible even to individuals with limited art skills. However, AI has also triggered debates over copyright, ethics, and the broader impact on artistic value, particularly regarding commissions and style replication. This paper offers a concise review of notable AI systems and presents qualitative insights from focus group discussions and interviews with senior Thai artists, professionals who have long served as both educators and practitioners. Although AI can aid rapid idea generation and stylistic experimentation, the participating artists emphasize the enduring importance of foundational skills–such as sketching and color theory–in achieving a genuine aesthetic. Rather than viewing AI as a threat, they acknowledge its potential to inspire creativity, yet they also stress that handmade art remains vital for cultural preservation, educational value, and personal artistic identity. By integrating these expert perspectives with established research, this study underscores both the advantages and drawbacks of AI-driven art, ultimately advocating for balanced curricula, transparent ethical guidelines, and collaborative strategies to ensure that technology supports, rather than overshadows, the human aesthetic experience.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is dramatically changing the way people work in many industries, including academia. Beyond its use for teaching, generative AI can also have a major impact on accelerating research processes. For example, generative AI can facilitate the identification of relevant articles when conducting a systematic literature review (SLR). This article compares six AIs (Forefront, GetGPT, ThebAI, Claude, Bard, and H2O) with their respective large language models (LLMs) when classifying 596 articles in the screening phase of an SLR. This SLR is aimed at exploring the development of non-technical skills with the support of technology in the field of medical education. Forefront with the LLM GPT-4 was the AI that obtained better results. The impact of this research is expected to contribute towards automating some of the phases of SRLs. Nevertheless, it is important to keep in mind limitations associated with the technology used to support this research, such as the rapid changes that AIs and their LLMs are currently undergoing, or potential restrictions on the number of requests per minute that AIs can receive as well as restrictions on the geographical location (since not all these AIs are available in all countries).},

  abstract={This paper presents our submission to the Financial Narrative Summarization (FNS) task at the FNP-2023 workshop. The FNS task involves the generation of concise summaries, not exceeding 1000 words, for annual financial reports composed in English, Spanish, and Greek. In our prior work, presented in FNP-2022, we introduced DiMSum [1], a novel framework designed to automatically identify crucial narrative sections within financial reports and quantify their weighted contributions. The field of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently witnessed significant advancements, prompting us to explore their utility in summarizing financial reports. Our investigation revealed that LLMs, when left to their own devices often struggle to effectively summarize complex financial documents, necessitating external guidance. In this study, we demonstrate how LLMs, when guided by the DiMSum framework, exhibit substantial improvements in the quality of financial report summarization. To the best of our knowledge, this research marks the first instance of applying LLMs to the FNS task, offering a novel approach to enhancing the summarization of financial reports.},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={This study proposes a novel Quantile Regression Generative Adversarial Networks (QR-GAN), which uses quantile regression to improve GAN performance by mitigating issues of GAN such as non-convergence, mode collapse, and gradient problems. Instead of directly minimizing the 1-Wasserstein distance between real and generated data distributions, as in WGANs, the proposed method leverages the quantile loss to encourage the generator to produce a diverse range of outputs. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the output space of the discriminator and the gradients of fake samples to identify the root causes of mode collapse. Our study reveals that constraining the discriminator to specific values can lead to mode collapse. The proposed QR-GAN method exhibits a high level of robustness against mode collapse and significantly improves the generation performance, as measured by the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) metric, compared to other GAN variants. These findings suggest that the proposed QR-GAN method has the potential to advance the state-of-the-art in GAN research and improve their applicability in a variety of domains.},

  abstract={Organoid intelligence (OI), the next paradigm of intelligence, draws inspiration from the biological learning of organs. On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) draws its inspiration only from the cognitive processes of the brain. While taking ethical and technological limitations into account, biological learning helps to conceptualize, accept, and apply them. Just as AI helped to make supercomputers possible, OI may help create biocomputers. Even though AI has increased the capabilities of technology to unimaginable heights, it still appears immature and is steadily moving toward cognitive computing to push the envelope even farther. In contrast to AI, OI is a new multidisciplinary computer area that attempts to be more approachable. OI has the ability to produce novel biocomputers, such as organoids, that use parts derived from live organisms to perform computational tasks. Organoids, such as human nasal organoids, are microscopic tissue cultures made from stem cells that mimic some of the functions of real organs. Although they have been used for many different purposes, including drug discovery and illness modeling, scientists are only now beginning to explore their potential for biological information processing.},

  abstract={The introduction and rapid adoption of particular Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as Large Language Models, where among other, Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a prominent one, have caused a significant increase in research interest for prompt engineering. Prompt engineering can be loosely described as a new emerging field where one attempts to develop particular methods, strategies, and frameworks with the main aim of organizing and structuring inputs in such a way that sophisticated AI systems can perform different tasks. These methods, techniques, and frameworks can be concepts like in-context learning, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Retrieval Augmented Generation, ReAct prompting, and Directional Stimulus Prompting. These approaches are mainly developed so users can communicate more effectively and accurately with AI language models and enable obtaining better outputs or responses tailored to queries or goals they set. As an extension and new contribution to the mentioned research field, this conceptual paper aims to introduce, propose, and theorize the notion of ‘educational promptization’. This will be done by connecting prompting to a particular social scientific practice perspective, sociomateriality. The rationale for arguing, however, is related to a need to develop an alternative research perspective to those that already dominate the mentioned research field, a research stream this conceptual paper also aims to engage with. Educational promptization is suggested as there is a demand to develop a more student-centric media literacy, especially as students and teachers engage with AI language interpreters on a daily basis. This means that the proposed educational promptization can arguably be considered to be part of a future AI literacy. An essential component of it is that one has to encompass the relational and symmetrical engagement with AI models. This is perhaps required because students will most likely be challenged to master the knowledge and skills in designing prompts, while simultaneously being capable of critically and meaningfully assessing the output of the prompts they created. In other words, mastering the complex input-and-output engagements with an AI system will be essential in students’ future learning processes.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (AI), specifically Large Language Models (LLMS) such as generative pretrained transformers (GPTS) have emerged as a transformational technology in modern research and applications. This technology will revolutionize a wide variety of fields, including remote sensing and Earth observation. We explore the use of LLMS to improve and automate EO analysis, making these results more accessible to a broad range of decision makers. We develop a framework using this technology to support the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) and NASA’s Open Science initiative. This framework leverages current work on Earth observation tools, including the Open Data Cube (ODC) [1] and the OEA Algorithm Hub (AlgoHub). [2]In our work, we investigate the ability of large language models to orchestrate and reason with tools created to access geospatial data using the Open Data Cube and the OEA Algorithm Hub [2]. In this paper we propose a natural language analytical framework for orchestrating Earth observation (EO) analysis. The framework uses large language models to interpret an analysis request, devise a solution based on ODC and AlgoHub tools, and execute the analysis. Our experimental investigations demonstrate that an LLM, with its embedded contextual knowledge, can effectively discern and sequence the necessary processing steps required to fulfill Earth observation analysis requests. This research demonstrates the potential of Generative AI (LLMs) in streamlining and enhancing EO analyses and empowering the observation community.In summary, Generative AI (LLMs) can enhance the capabilities of Earth observation analysis by automating tasks, providing natural language interfaces, and facilitating the extraction of valuable insights from the vast and complex datasets generated by remote sensing and EO technologies.},

  abstract={This work in progress, innovative practice paper proposes a Learning and Teaching Impact Assessment Tool (TALIAT) that would help in assessing the sways of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) on important aspects of Learning and Teaching (L&T). The focus of TALIAT is to identify the most relevant elements of GAI grammar and establish how they would reflect on Learning and Teaching practices. GAIsupported systems are generally perceived beneficial as they ensure resource availability, quick and ongoing feedback, higher level of interactivity, and continued engagement. GAI tools also inculcate the ability to perform independent research through progressive and systematic probing and consequent delivery of information. Nonetheless, issues pertaining to trust, liability, transparency, honesty, fairness in judgement and trustworthy reporting of student success need to be addressed for proper adoption of GAI applications. It is being acknowledged now that various stakeholders like system developers, administrators, policymakers, psychologists, educators, sociologists, and legal experts need to work together and agree upon standards and frameworks for producing professionally, ethically, and legally acceptable GAI systems. For these stakeholders to work together, an easy to follow and adopt assessment tool needs to be designed. This would facilitate establishing methods, and processes for confidently determining impacts of GAI technologies on Learning and Teaching. The current literature has yet to provide such facilitation. Such enablement would: improve teacher's perception of, and users' confidence in, GAI systems as tools like TALIAT would assist in assessing impacts of GAI tools prior to their deployment. The proposed TALIAT could also safeguard quality of information, student competence reporting, academic culture, and social and ethical values. TALIAT projects sixteen elements of grammar on seven important aspects of GAI implications namely, handling biases, prompt tuning and evaluation, output fairness, regulatory compliance, error detection, accountability and explainability. These seven aspects are deemed important for investigating the purpose, impetuses, scope, and L&T impact mitigation strategies of GAI applications. A set of thirty-two questions is included in TALIAT for GAI tools' impact assessment. TALIAT will be useful for the GAI stakeholders to work together as it enables informed decision making about adopting GAI systems and places rail guards for development of trustworthy GAI systems.},

Inspired by this, in this paper, we explore the integration of GAI into SC, focusing on technological intersection and security risks. We begin with a comprehensive overview of SC and GAI, analyzing the current challenges. Subsequently, we elaborate on how GAI can optimize SC from multiple perspectives, including semantic extraction, data transmission, and cloud-edge deployment. In particular, we focus on security and privacy issues within the GAI-enhanced SC architecture. Finally, we validate the feasibility of our theory through a case study and outline potential directions for future research.},

  abstract={Although the concept of digital twin technology has been in existence for nearly half a century, its application in healthcare is a relatively recent development. In healthcare, the utilization of digital twin and data-driven models has proven to enhance clinical decision support, particularly in the treatment and assessment of chronic wounds, leading to improved clinical outcomes. This article proposes the implementation of a digital twin in the domain of healthcare, specifically in the management of chronic wounds, by leveraging artificial intelligence techniques. The digital twin is composed of data collection, data processing, and AI models dedicated to wound healing. A novel AI pipeline is utilized to track the healing of chronic wounds. The digital twin, serving as a virtual representation of the actual wound, simulates and replicates the healing process. Furthermore, the proposed wound-healing prediction model effectively guides the treatment of chronic wounds. Additionally, by comparing the actual wound with its digital twin, the system enables early identification of non-healing wounds, facilitating timely adjustments and modifications to the treatment plan. By incorporating a digital twin in healthcare, the proposed system enables personalized and tailored treatments, potentially playing a crucial role in proactive problem identification.},

  abstract={With the advent of sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the proliferation of deepfakes and the spread of m/disinformation have emerged as formidable threats to the integrity of information ecosystems worldwide. This paper provides an overview of the current literature. Within the frontier AI’s crucial application in developing defense mechanisms for detecting deepfakes, we highlight the mechanisms through which generative AI based on large models (LM-based GenAI) craft seemingly convincing yet fabricated contents. We explore the multifaceted implications of LM-based GenAI on society, politics, and individual privacy violations, underscoring the urgent need for robust defense strategies. To address these challenges, in this study, we introduce an integrated framework that combines advanced detection algorithms, cross-platform collaboration, and policy-driven initiatives to mitigate the risks associated with AI-Generated Content (AIGC). By leveraging multi-modal analysis, digital watermarking, and machine learning-based authentication techniques, we propose a defense mechanism adaptable to AI capabilities of ever-evolving nature. Furthermore, the paper advocates for a global consensus on the ethical usage of GenAI and implementing cyber-wellness educational programs to enhance public awareness and resilience against m/disinformation. Our findings suggest that a proactive and collaborative approach involving technological innovation and regulatory oversight is essential for safeguarding netizens while interacting with cyberspace against the insidious effects of deepfakes and GenAI-enabled m/disinformation campaigns.},

  abstract={As a cutting-edge technology of low-altitude Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), autonomous aerial vehicle object detection significantly enhances the surveillance services capabilities of low-altitude AIoT. However, the difficulty of object detection is exacerbated by the high proportion of small and obscure objects in the captured images. To address the mentioned challenges, we present an efficient multiband infrared small object detection approach for low-altitude intelligent surveillance services. First, we propose the multiband infrared image fusion algorithm based on cascade-GAN (MIF-CGAN), which produces fused images with high information entropy and high contrast. Then, the Transformer-based multiscale dense small object detection (MsDSOD) algorithm is proposed. The algorithm consists of the global-local object detection (G-LOD) network, the object dense area extraction (O-DAE) module, and the weighted boxes fusion (WBF) module. It extracts small objects features at different scales from infrared images and fuses the global and local detection results to accurately identify small objects in dense scenes. Furthermore, compared to the traditional algorithms, the mean average precision (mAP) of MsDSOD is improved by 0.80% and the average precision in small object detection  $({\mathrm { AP}}_{s})$  is improved by 0.72%. The proposed algorithm is optimally suited to deal with complex scenes with dense small objects and background occlusion.},

  abstract={In this research-to-practice full work, we will explore how innovative educational strategies can improve students' learning experiences. Specifically, we will focus on the early development of skills in engineering students, such as numerical manipulation for problem-solving, proficient spreadsheet management, experimental implementation, and mastery of mathematical modeling complemented by informed decision-making with graphics understanding and interpretation. The effective utilization of available technological resources helps to enhance the student learning experience and prepare them for the challenges in their engineering professional practice. Physics courses often present high rates of low academic performance, but these innovative approaches can enhance active student engagement and help nurture essential skills. However, integrating technology into innovative teaching methods can have implications; one seen recently is the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (G-AI) in many instruction courses; as a technology of easy access and manipulation, it can result in a confused tool if students don't have the appropriate instruction in its use. Therefore, educating students on the ethical and proper use of AI technology is crucial, guiding them in formulating relevant questions and accurately interpreting the results. To achieve this, we used the Learning Science and Engineering with Electronic Spreadsheets Cycle (LSEESC) methodology, which has been rigorously tested across various contexts over the last four years and has shown promising results. We will support its implementation with comprehensive guidance and use Artificial Intelligence as a prompt/chat tool (e.g., Chat GPT) as a supplementary tool. This strategy aimed to help students develop effective study habits for independent study sessions and promote autonomous learning. We examine how students ask for help from AI, including their choice of words and language. We will also investigate the effects of using casual or informal language and suggest guidelines for constructing practical questions. Our goal was to assist students in obtaining a better understanding and explanations of physics concepts and problem-solving exercises with the help of AI combined with a well-defined methodology, like the LSEESC, which promotes the development of skills like numerical manipulation, mathematical modeling, variables understanding, graphics generation, interpretation, and understanding. The learning intervention considers N = 140 students for working on the LSEESC methodology and using G-AI in physics courses during spring 2024, with students in the first year of academic engineering programs. The topics to evidence the learning process are kinematics and electrics. The results were analyzed with the Normalized Conceptual Gain (NCG) given a value of <g> = 0.75 and 0.67, the Concentration Factor (CF), Rasch's index, and qualitative students' question formulation. This is particularly important because, in some instances, the results provided by G-AI were incorrect owing to the system's inability to detect specific implications that a human can easily recognize; the teacher explained the confused results presented by G-AI and student received the corresponding feedback about these issues with artificial intelligence.},

Currently we are in an Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, and generative AI (also widely known as AI chatbots) are already popular across college and university campuses. Generative AI that are designed to learn and mimic human conversation is capable of generating, translating, or paraphrasing text and answering questions in a way that is often indistinguishable from human-generated content. We investigate the above-mentioned potential challenges faced by students while learning CS2 course at Oklahoma State University (OSU) and redesign the course homework in Fall 2023 semester. The objectives of the redesigned course homework are to provide students with opportunities to use generative AI to support their learning in the CS2 course as well as measure the effectiveness of utilizing generative AI to improve student learning outcomes in the CS2 course. At the end of Fall 2023 semester, we conducted a student perception survey in the CS2 course and collected valuable feedback from 47 out of 61 students (77% response rate). In summary, 85.1%, 76.6%, 74.5%, 63.8%, and 70.2% respondents indicated that generative AI help to understand testing and debugging better, improve coding skills and code quality, design and implement efficient data structures and algorithms, select appropriate algorithms and data structures with the assistance of generative AI, and under-stand the importance of designing and implementing efficient data structures and algorithms, respectively. In this paper, we summarize the experience of redesigning CS2 course homework at OSU, share lessons learned, and provide candid suggestions for utilizing course homework in CS2 courses at other institutions.},

  abstract={Using Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Business Development and Opportunities is a ground-breaking concept that is changing how businesses formulate their strategies and content, how they can improve existing decisions and/or foster new market initiatives. Marketing can be enhanced by the use of advanced model AI in generating more profound approaches that can be adopted in creating marketing material in order to take up a business a notch higher. Thus, this paper aims at proposing a new method that complements the use of GPT-4 and Variational Autoencoders (VAE) in generating good business content and synthetic data as compared to conventional approaches. The applied in this paper is a python-based methodology that comprises of data collection process which involves Kaggle datasets encompassing market trends, customer behavior, and competitors analysis. Specifically, web scraping and data augmentation are used in preprocessing with the help of BeautifulSoup, Scrapy as well as SMOTE to improve the quality and variability of the dataset. Feature engineering employs PCA and TF-IDF to select and transform the features for improving the decision boundary of the dataset and to obtain the textual patterns. The GPT-4 model is used for the generation of contextualised and business relevant text, which helps the VAEs in the creation of synthetic data that improves the models capability in data sparse situations and for various business scenarios. The procedure of fine-tuning of the parameters of the model to enhance accuracy and relevance of the AI generated outputs is known as Bayesian Optimization. The suggested approach performs better than the existing literature including better BLEU scores, cross-validation accuracy, and runs faster. Essentially, this research offers a strong basis for employing generative AI in business while presenting notable improvements over prior models and improving business strategy implementation.},

  abstract={Anime Character Portrait Generation is an interesting but a challenging job. At present, most of the existing methods are solved by using generative adversarial networks. However, the styles of anime character portrait are quite different and Generative Adversarial Networks is also prone to cause problems including mode collapse, which makes it hard to generate good anime character portrait samples. In this paper, DRAGAN model will be optimized and the improved version of the basic structure of Conv-BN-Relu-Pooling will be applied reasonably. The optimized DRAGAN is trained by using alternating gradient updates procedure to achieve high-quality generation samples. At the same time, through the experimental comparison with other generative adversarial networks of deep learning, it is finally verified that the optimized DRAGAN performs better than the experimental comparison group in terms of image visual quality, FID and gradient penalty terms. The mode collapse problem has also been alleviated finally.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the effect of midterm and short quizzes on the success scores at the end of the course through machine learning methods. Data from 3,427 students in the Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences of Istanbul Rumeli University, recorded from the year 2019 to 2024, were analyzed, and of that, 1,547 records were qualified for machine learning after applying specific filtering criteria. Due to insufficient data, 6,300 synthetic records were generated using the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) method. To ensure high-quality data generation and stable training, a Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) was implemented, enhancing the synthetic dataset's diversity and reliability. In this paper, the algorithms of Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost, Linear Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used for the classification and prediction of course success. Among these, the most accurate performance, quantified for example by R2 score, Mean Absolute Error and Mean Squared Error, was given by RF, with a probability of being correct at 83.81%. The results indicate that midterm exams have a significantly stronger influence on predicting course success, while short quizzes play an important role in maintaining consistent student engagement and reinforcing foundational concepts. Future studies will aim for data diverseness by adding more features and comparing new methods, such as Artificial Neural Networks with hyperparameter optimization.},

  abstract={Edge intelligence, also called edge-native artificial intelligence (AI), is an emerging technological framework focusing on seamless integration of AI, communication networks, and mobile edge computing. It has been considered to be one of the key missing components in the existing 5G network and is widely recognized to be one of the most sought after functions for tomorrow's wireless 6G cellular systems. In this article, we identify the key requirements and challenges of edge-native AI in 6G. A self-learning architecture based on self-supervised generative adversarial nets is introduced to demonstrate the potential performance improvement that can be achieved by automatic data learning and synthesizing at the edge of the network. We evaluate the performance of our proposed self-learning architecture in a university campus shuttle system connected via a 5G network. Our result shows that the proposed architecture has the potential to identify and classify unknown services that emerge in edge computing networks.

  abstract={In this work, we build a QuizGPT web interface for learners to learn Python via quizzing and chatting. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of generative AI on learning. To effectively evaluate learners’ learning achievements, the quizzes must be diverse, and the options should be challenging to ensure a complete understanding of the material. It is a time-consuming challenge for teachers to create adaptive quizzes based on learners’ levels for individual learning needs. This study generates 366 quiz questions automatically via generative AI in three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard), based on Python knowledge points. A positive correlation observed between the QuizGPT platform activities and learners’ test scores. These activities include the number of quizzes attended, the correctness rates, and the frequency of participation in generative AI sessions. Additionally, QuizGPT platform activities could predict learners’ test scores with a Root Mean Squared Error percentage (%RMSE) of 3.58%. Remarkably, interaction with generative AI proves to enhance Python programming skills more effectively than the number of quiz attempts. Survey analysis reveals that QuizGPT can reduce learning anxiety and enhance learning interest. Our findings suggest that generative AI, as implemented in the QuizGPT platform, is a potent tool for academic improvement, significantly enhancing self-regulation and engagement in learning Python programming.},

  abstract={The rise in usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT emphasizes the significance of exploring how prompt inputs influence response quality. This research analyzed 308 prompt-response pairs sourced from students taking Project-based classes like AI, machine learning, and Game design. Prompt quality was assessed based on specificity, clarity, and tone, while response quality was measured based on accuracy, relevance and complexity using a 5-point Likert scale. Our study explored correlation between various factors such as prompt specificity, response accuracy and relevance using Pearson analysis. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of ChatGPT across each prompt type to determine which prompt class generated the best and worst results. Through the adoption of a prompt engineering approach, the paper identifies practical recommendations that students can employ to improve their interactions with ChatGPT. The research emphasizes that advanced methods such as prompt chaining and knowledge-augmented prompts are more effective than simple prompts in generating precise and comprehensive outputs successfully. This study shows ChatGPT's performance across various domains. The outcome of this study aims to help educators and learners to understand how to use generative AI effectively for programming problems and to support the development of efficient AI -enhanced learning environments.},

  abstract={In the past two years, technology has undergone significant changes that have had a major impact on healthcare systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a key component of this change, and it can assist doctors with various healthcare systems and intelligent health systems. AI is crucial in diagnosing common diseases, developing new medications, and analyzing patient information from electronic health records. However, one of the main issues with adopting AI in healthcare is the lack of transparency, as doctors must interpret the output of the AI. Explainable AI (XAI) is extremely important for the healthcare sector and comes into play in this regard. With XAI, doctors, patients, and other stakeholders can more easily examine a decision's reliability by knowing its reasoning due to XAI's interpretable explanations. Deep learning is used in this study to discuss explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in medical image analysis. The primary goal of this paper is to provide a generic six-category XAI architecture for classifying DL-based medical image analysis and interpretability methods.The interpretability method/XAI approach for medical image analysis is often categorized based on the explanation and technical method. In XAI approaches, the explanation method is further sub-categorized into three types: text-based, visual-based, and examples-based. In interpretability technical method, it was divided into nine categories. Finally, the paper discusses the advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of each neural network-based interpretability method for medical imaging analysis.},

  abstract={Pathology is the most important branch of Medical Science which fundamentally concerns the origin, cause, and nature of the disease. This domain contributes the most important part of the diagnostic infrastructure. The pathological examination includes examining, Tissues, Organs, Body fluids. In this examination, the tissue is fixed on a glass slide by certain procedures and then observed under a microscope for disease. Now with technological advancement, the traditional pathological operation is getting evolved and emerged as Digital pathology. Digital pathology comprises the digitalization of Histopathological slides using a Whole-slide scanner which is a microscope under robotic and computer control and analysing these digitalized images or whole-slide image using a Computational approach. This digitalization creates a high-resolution, enhanced pixel image of pathological specimen that ultimately generates a tremendous amount of data up to gigabytes per biopsy. Because of algorithmic advancement and more convenient computing power, in the past few decades, Artificial Intelligence and machine learning have spread their roots into healthcare and clinical applications. And artificial intelligence and digital pathology synergy is one of the examples of these two fields intersection.

  abstract={The authors clarified in 2020 that the relationship between AI and security can be classified into four categories: (a) attacks using AI, (b) attacks by AI itself, (c) attacks to AI, and (d) security measures using AI, and summarized research trends for each. Subsequently, ChatGPT became available in November 2022, and the various potential applications of ChatGPT and other generative AIs and the associated risks have attracted attention. In this study, we examined how the emergence of generative AI affects the relationship between AI and security. The results show that (a) the need for the four perspectives of AI and security remains unchanged in the era of generative AI, (b) The generalization of AI targets and automatic program generation with the birth of generative AI will greatly increase the risk of attacks by the AI itself, (c) The birth of generative AI will make it possible to generate easy-to-understand answers to various questions in natural language, which may lead to the spread of fake news and phishing e-mails that can easily fool many people and an increase in AI-based attacks. In addition, it became clear that (1) attacks using AI and (2) responses to attacks by AI itself are highly important. Among these, the analysis of attacks by AI itself, using an attack tree, revealed that the following measures are needed: (a) establishment of penalties for developing inappropriate programs, (b) introduction of a reporting system for signs of attacks by AI, (c) measures to prevent AI revolt by incorporating Asimov's three principles of robotics, and (d) establishment of a mechanism to prevent AI from attacking humans even when it becomes confused.},

  abstract={In the era of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC), conditional multimodal synthesis technologies (e.g., text-to-image) are dynamically reshaping the natural content. Brain signals, serving as potential reflections of how the brain interprets external information, exhibit a distinctive one-to-many correspondence with various external modalities. This correspondence makes brain signals emerge as a promising guiding condition for multimodal synthesis (e.g., image, text, and audio), which is crucial for developing practical brain–computer interface systems and unraveling complex mechanisms underlying human perception. This survey comprehensively examines the emerging field of brain-conditional multimodal synthesis, termed AIGC-brain, to delineate the current landscape and future directions. To begin, related neuroimaging datasets and generative models are introduced as the foundation of AIGC-brain decoding and analysis. Next, we present a comprehensive taxonomy according to AIGC-brain methodologies, followed by task-specific representative work and implementation details to facilitate in-depth comparison and analysis. Quality assessments are then introduced for both qualitative and quantitative evaluation. Finally, this survey explores insights gained, outlining current challenges and prospects of AIGC-brain. As a pioneering survey, this article paves the way for future advances in AIGC-brain research.},

  abstract={The telemetry data of spacecraft is an ultra-high dimensional time series used to indicate on-orbit operation status, and anomaly detection can effectively ensure safety and reliability. Aiming at the characteristics and complex correlation of high dimensional telemetry data, this paper proposes a novel anomaly detection method based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for telemetry data anomaly detection. Instead of treating each variable independently, our proposed method captures the latent representation amongst multi-dimensional time series. For normal data, the GAN-based anomaly detection method can obtain a reconstructed time series similar to the original time series, learning the probability distribution model of normal data. For abnormal data, the reconstructed time series deviates greatly from the original time series. In the GAN framework, we use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as the network structure of generator for time series reconstruction and discriminator for calculating the probability of being the real time series, which can learn the temporal features of telemetry data. We also propose a novel anomaly score called GDScore, which comprehensively considers the reconstruction error of the generator and the output of the discriminator. We conduct experiments with two telemetry datasets, which verifies that our proposed GAN-based anomaly detection method can effectively detect outliers.},

  abstract={In order to estimate the model using the method it is necessary to train two different models simultaneously. The first model, called the model (D) is responsible, for determining whether a particular sample is from the training data or generated by another model called G. On the hand G aims to understand the underlying distribution of the data. By training G to maximize the likelihood of D making mistakes a competitive environment is established. There are applications for G and D but one particularly notable solution emerges. D consistently evaluates any input as if it came from training data while G effectively captures the details of that training data distribution. Notably this system can be trained using known techniques like backpropagation when implementing G and D as multilayer perceptrons. This eliminates the need for inference networks or intricate Markov chains, during both training and sample generation processes. Thorough evaluations of the generated samples confirm the potential of this framework as demonstrated through testing. This innovative approach offers an efficient means to capture data distributions, which could potentially revolutionize generative modeling.},

  abstract={Conventional autoencoder-based systems, comprising a neural-network encoder at the transmitter and a neural-network decoder at the receiver, often face limitations in re-alistic signal transmission due to its reliance on differentiable channel models. In response to this limitation, an end-to-end framework has emerged, employing a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for channel learning. The CGAN not only learns to represent channel effects through feature extraction but also facilitates gradient back-propagation between the receiver and the transmitter, thereby enhancing the system's adaptability. This paper extends the CGAN-based end-to-end system from single input single output channels to multiple input multiple output (MIMO) scenarios. This CGAN-based MIMO system demonstrates promising performance comparable to the autoencoder communication systems, highlighting the potential of CGANs as effective alternatives for original channels.},

  abstract={Due to the randomness and time correlation of photovoltaic (PV) power output, the PV data obtained by conventional short-term point or interval prediction methods cannot support the robust scheduling and reliable operation of the power system under the condition of high proportion of PV integration. A photovoltaic random scenario prediction model based on Time - generative adversarial network (TimeGAN) is proposed. Firstly, the photovoltaic samples are decomposed into static and time-series data, and the network structures of embedding, reconstruction, generation and discrimination are constructed. Secondly, taking the static and time-series data as samples, the embedding and reconstruction networks are jointly trained. Finally, taking the output of the embedding network as samples, the generation and discrimination networks are trained adversarially, and the output of the generation network is fed back to the embedding-reconstruction training to test the fitting effect of the time series. Aiming to minimize the reconstruction, supervised and unsupervised losses, the model conducts in-depth learning of the photovoltaic time characteristics and predicts random scenarios. The validity of the proposed model is verified by the example calculation.},

  abstract={Face image super-resolution reconstruction is a crucial task for enhancing low-quality surveillance videos. Most state-of-the-art approaches employ generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs are known to suffer from training instability issues. We propose a single face image super-resolution method called Single Face Image Super-Resolution Reconstruction (SFSR), based on Wasserstein GANs and residual dense networks. Without requiring any prior information, our model can directly generate high-resolution face images at 4x or 8x scale from arbitrary low-resolution inputs, outperforming traditional bilinear upsampling. To further enhance image quality, we utilize a multi-level residual dense generator with skip connections. Our loss function combines pixel-wise, perceptual, and adversarial losses to simultaneously optimize fidelity and realism. Extensive experiments on CelebA and CNBC datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative performance, validating the efficacy of our approach for stabilizing GAN training and producing sharp, artifact-free super-resolved face images.},

  pages={351-354},
  abstract={Underwater image enhancement is a crucial technology for supporting underwater exploration and rescue operations. With the continuous development of the ocean, underwater activities such as archaeology, pipeline inspection, and dredging have been increasing. Nevertheless, owing to the unique complexity of the underwater environment, captured underwater images often face the challenge of information loss, manifested as blurry images, low signal - to - noise ratios, and poor color quality. These issues significantly limit the effective utilization and value of high - quality underwater images in scientific research and engineering practices. Currently, common problems in the field of underwater image enhancement research include high algorithm complexity and insufficient feature extraction capabilities. Therefore, to address the problems of insufficient feature extraction of the target information under test, we adopted the generative adversarial network (GAN) as the main architecture and incorporated an attention mechanism into the network generator. This enables us to centre around the key information of the image during feature extraction, resulting in clearer images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing underwater image enhancement methods, validating the effectiveness and the proposed approach.},

  pages={1350-1356},
  abstract={In haze weather, visible light is scattered and absorbed when it passes through the atmosphere, causing significant degradation in image quality. To address this issue, we propose a multi-scale fusion dehazing algorithm based on an improved Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). In the generator part, we design a multi-scale fusion attention network (Grid-G) with a three rows, multi-column structure. The network first extracts and strengthens local and global features in the image through a feature enhancement module, effectively solving the problem that traditional dehazing methods cannot fully capture image details and global semantic information. Then, channel attention and coordinate attention are introduced to process the dense fog area and high-frequency area of the image from different angles. Finally, a multi-scale fusion module is designed to replace the original ordinary feature splicing operation and enhance the detail fidelity of the image.In the discriminator part, a fusion discriminator (FDG-D) is constructed to enhance the ability to distinguish the source of the image by introducing the high-frequency and low-frequency information of the image as additional priors. The experimental results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper not only has natural colors and clear details subjectively, but also outperforms the existing mainstream algorithms in objective indicators.},

  abstract={English has become the most widely used language in the world. In the fields of English education and cultural dissemination, traditional teaching methods and materials are no longer able to meet the growing demand for cultural understanding and communication. This study constructed a Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) model, which generates highly realistic and diverse cultural communication materials by training generators and discriminators. The generator generates data from random noise, while the discriminator distinguishes between generated data and real data. The experimental results show that the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) value of the material generated by GANs is much lower than that of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), exhibiting higher image realism; its Mode Coverage (MC) value is also higher than other methods, averaging 90.428%. In addition, the audience showed high click through rates and engagement with the materials generated by GANs, verifying their effectiveness in cultural communication and confirming the potential of GANs in generating diverse English cultural communication materials.},

  abstract={This paper explores the applicability of conditional generative adversarial networks in audio-to-audio translation problems and proposes a neural network architecture capable of doing so. Recent advances have shown that causal convolutions can be effective for modeling raw audio when their kernel is dilated by many factors, in contrast to previous techniques that utilized recurrent approaches. Embedding such convolutions within a conditional GAN architecture allows the targeted generation of raw audio given a certain input. This architecture can then be used to learn and simulate certain translative operations applied to an input signal. This creates the defined problem of converting one audio signal into another, which has different characteristics. We also propose a novel discriminator structure for the evaluation of generated audio.},

  abstract={The research led by AI specialist, Andre Cia, stated that ChatGPT would immediately extinguish the profession of copywriter, translator, and proofreader and, within 12 months, the profession of journalist. The eventual extinction of such professions, through the transfer of imminently human tasks to a Generative AI technology, will increase structural unemployment in Brazil, due to the need for these unemployed workers to seek greater qualifications so that they can obtain their reinsertion into the job market. The purpose of this article is to analyze and determine whether the exterminating predictions mentioned were materialized, including the worsening of Brazilian structural unemployment, with repercussions on public spending for the payment of unemployment insurance. Using the quantitative research method to approach numerical data and public statistics on the subject, as well as descriptive qualitative for the purpose of understanding the phenomenon under study and the technique of reviewing accessible literature, supporting literature and reviewing the legislation, it was found that the use of ChatGPT did not exterminate the professions studied and was not even responsible for the high Brazilian unemployment rate or high public spending.},

  abstract={The aviation business encounters difficulties in correctly and swiftly predicting flight fares due to the dynamic nature of the sector. Factors such as variations in demand, fuel costs, and the intricacies of various routes have an impact on this. This work presents a new method to tackle this issue by utilizing generative artificial intelligence (GAI) approaches to accurately forecast airfares in real-time. This paper presents a novel framework that integrates generative models, deep learning architectures, and historical pricing data to improve the precision of future flight price predictions. The study employs a GAI within a cutting-edge web engineering framework. This approach is designed primarily to gather knowledge about complex patterns and relationships present in historical airline data. Through the utilization of this methodology, the model is able to accurately perceive complex connections and adjust to ever-changing market conditions. Our model utilizes deep neural networks to effectively handle various circumstances and extract vital information, so facilitating a comprehensive comprehension of the intricate elements that impact flight cost. Moreover, the suggested approach places significant emphasis on precisely predicting upcoming occurrences in real-time, facilitating prompt reactions to market volatility and offering a valuable resource for airlines, travel agents, and customers alike. In order to enhance the accuracy of real-time forecasts, we utilize a web-based platform that allows for smooth interaction with live data streams and guarantees swift updates.

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving significant breakthroughs in computer vision and image processing. However, there are still many challenges in rendering complex scenes, particularly generating and controlling images for extreme weather conditions. In this work, we propose a novel generative model based on ControlNet and achieve precise control and high-quality rendering of extreme weather features by combining a sparsely connected Squeeze-and-Excitation module with a zero-convolution design. The proposed model excels in generating highly realistic extreme weather scenes, including heavy rain and snow, while significantly enhancing the ability to fine-tune weather characteristic parameters. Experimental results validate the model's exceptional generation quality and robust control stability, which not only realistically reproduces complex weather scenes but also allows flexible adjustments to weather characteristics such as rainfall intensity, snowflake density, and flame range. Compared to previous methods, the model demonstrates substantial improvements in image detail fidelity, weather feature consistency and generation efficiency. This technology shows immense potential for applications in disaster simulation and early warning systems.},

  abstract={In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GAN) have become a research hotspot in the field of deep learning. Researchers apply them to the field of anomaly detection and are committed to effectively and accurately identifying abnormal images in practical applications. In anomaly detection, traditional supervised learning algorithms have limitations in training with a large number of known labeled samples. Therefore, the anomaly detection model of unsupervised learning GAN is the research object for discussion and research. Firstly, the basic principles of GAN are introduced. Secondly, several typical GAN-based anomaly detection models are sorted out in detail. Then by comparing the similarities and differences of each derivative model, discuss and summarize their respective advantages, limitations and application scenarios. Finally, the problems and challenges faced by GAN in anomaly detection are discussed, and future research directions are prospected.},

  pages={2743-2747},
  abstract={Cross-modal hashing has achieved significant progress in recent years. However, how to effectively learn more discriminative hash codes of each modality and simultaneous alleviate the loss of modality information is still a challenging problem. Focusing on this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel cross-modal hashing approach named Semantic Preserving Generative Adversarial Network (SPGAN). The overall network architecture consists of two sub-networks, i.e., a semantic preserving generative adversarial network module and a discriminative hashing module. The generator maps text features into the image feature space. And the discriminator judges whether the feature representations are real image features or generated image features. The adversarial learning process can effectively reduce modality difference and preserve information of the image modality as much as possible. The discriminative hashing module projects the real and generated image features into a Hamming space to obtain hash codes, and explores semantic similarities for enhancing the discriminant ability of hash codes. Experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate that SPGAN can outperform state-of-the-art related works.},

  abstract={This case study aims to evaluate the impact of AI video creation tools on enhancing students’ interest, engagement, and ability to conduct investigations related to language, society, and culture. The participants were university students enrolled in a sociolinguistics course. They received training on using AI video creation tools to create short videos for their sociolinguistic projects. After completing the projects, the students were invited to complete a survey to assess the extent to which the case study achieved its objectives. The survey included seven factors: self-efficacy, actual usage, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, user attitude, perceived learning outcomes, and intention for future use. The correlation test results show that all these factors were significantly and positively correlated, and most correlations were strong. The survey reveals that AI video creation tools enhance students’ interest and engagement in their sociolinguistic investigations and improve their creativity, problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication skills. The positive survey results, along with the informative and creative videos generated by the students, demonstrate the applicability of AI technology in education.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The exponential expansion of generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) has led to a marked increase in energy usage and carbon emissions. This exploratory study hypothesizes that enhancing the mental health of AI systems can mitigate energy consumption. By drawing parallels between AI challenges, such as attention scatter, computational dyscalculia, and overfitting-and human mental disorders, we seek to develop novel strategies for optimizing AI efficiency. We propose that incorporating psychiatric expertise during AI training and development could steer models towards more energy-efficient operations, potentially revolutionizing training methodologies in the forthcoming years. These AI-related issues contribute to operational inefficiencies, prompting frequent algorithmic adjustments and heightened computational resource demands. Improving the management of these challenges within AI could reduce errors and redundant processes, refine decision-making, and lessen the necessity for retraining. We assessed the environmental impact of Gen-AI, focusing on energy expenditures during training and inference phases. For instance, training models like GPT-3 reportedly consume approximately 1,287 megawatt-hours, with ongoing inference contributing to even higher emissions. We contend that enhancing AI mental health and utilizing algorithms such as CarbonMin-which allocate computational tasks to regions with lower carbon footprints-can significantly reduce emissions by an estimated 35% currently and up to 71% by 2035. Advancements in hardware and software efficiencies could further diminish the carbon footprint by as much as a thousandfold compared to traditional models. This preliminary research suggests that integrating psychiatric principles into AI development could optimize performance and substantially lower energy consumption and carbon emissions, unveiling new avenues for future investigation.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized and transformed the landscape of software development and testing by introducing new efficiencies and capabilities through advancements like Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs). While these technologies bring major benefits in terms of productivity, personalization, and innovation, they also raise critical ethical challenges, such as biases, lack of transparency, data privacy concerns, and potential negative societal impacts. This paper examines the ethical considerations involved in developing such advanced AI systems as well using AI systems within software development and testing. It explores existing ethical frameworks and principles provided by leading organizations, emphasizing core concepts like human-centered design, accountability, transparency, fairness, and privacy. Practical strategies for integrating ethical practices throughout the AI development lifecycle are discussed, with a strong emphasis on the need for continuous ethical evaluation. The paper explores the ethical landscape of AI in software development, addressing challenges like algorithmic bias, data security, and broader societal impacts. Real-world case studies presented in the paper demonstrate the consequences of neglecting ethical considerations. Looking forward, the paper suggests future directions, including the development of unified ethical standards, collaborative ethical auditing, regulatory advancements, and higher societal engagement.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can significantly improve cyber security operations if tasks and responsibilities are effectively shared between human and machine. AI techniques excel in some situational understanding tasks; for instance, classifying intrusions. However, existing AI systems are often overconfident in their classification: this reduces the trust of human analysts. Furthermore, sophisticated intrusions span across long time periods to reduce their footprint, and each decision to respond to a (suspected) attack can have unintended side effects. In this position paper we show how advanced AI systems handling uncertainty and encompassing expert knowledge can lessen the burden on human analysts. In detail: (1) Effective interaction with the analyst is a key issue for the success of an intelligence support system. This involves two issues: a clear and unambiguous system-analyst communication, only possible if both share the same domain ontology and conceptual framework, and effective interaction, allowing the analyst to query the system for justifications of the reasoning path followed and the results obtained. (2) Uncertainty-aware machine learning and reasoning is an effective method for anomaly detection, which can provide human operators with alternative interpretations of data with an accurate assessment of their confidence. This can contribute to reducing misunderstandings and building trust. (3) An event-processing algorithm including both a neural and a symbolic layer can help identify attacks spanning long intervals of time, that would remain undetected via a pure neural approach. (4) Such a symbolic layer is crucial for the human operator to estimate the appropriateness of possible responses to a suspected attack by considering both the probability that an attack is actually occurring and the impact (intended and unintended) of a given response.},

  abstract={With the growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into higher education, learners’ trust in AI systems has attracted increasing attention. This meta-analysis synthesized 78 independent effect sizes from 42 empirical studies (N = 28,970) to examine key antecedents and consequences of AI trust. Four categories of antecedents were assessed: technological performance, user experience, ethics and safety, and sociodemographic and individual differences. Trust in AI was also analyzed in relation to behavioral intention to use, learning outcomes, and AI acceptance. Results showed that technological performance was the strongest predictor of trust, followed by user experience and individual differences, while ethics and safety had a relatively weaker impact. Trust in AI significantly predicted all three outcomes, underscoring its mediating role. Moderator analyses revealed that high-level feedback enhanced the effects of technological performance and ethics on trust, and that trust was generally higher in learning-support tasks than in academic writing tasks. These findings offer theoretical and practical insights for optimizing educational AI design and promoting adaptive, trustworthy systems.},

As a starting point for the discussion, an illustrative experiment packaged as a game of trivia was conducted and played by 2383 participants which generated a total of 24502 guesses in differentiating between AI or humans.

  abstract={The emerging concept of delivering Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) foresees the deployment and reconfiguration of the next-generation networks, such as 6G, in a dynamic and elastic manner, tailored to the respective stakeholder’s intention. Taking this into account, the efficient management and orchestration of both telecommunication and computational resources across the network domains, i.e. access, transport and core presents a considerable challenge, even for network experts. To tackle this complexity, this paper explores the implementation of an intent-based management framework. The framework receives a high-level description of the desired network capabilities along with supplementary files, e.g. deployment descriptors, and translates them into configuration files consumable by the network itself. In order to achieve this, the paper establishes a translation pipeline that leverages the employment of emerging multimodal generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), and open industry-ready standard templates. The adoption of those two emerging technologies offers high dynamicity on the interpretation process of the user’s intent, while ensuring that its outcome is compatible with every orchestrator or next-generation Operating Support System (Next-gen OSS) that adheres to those standards.},

The Teacher, implemented by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), is trained to preserve and replay past knowledge corresponding to the probabilistic representations of previously learnt databases. Meanwhile, the Student module is implemented by a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) which infers its latent variable representation from both the output of the Teacher module as well as from the newly available database. Moreover, the Student module is trained to capture both continuous and discrete underlying data representations across different domains.

  abstract={This study explores the application of intelligent Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in illustration design and cultural and creative product design in Liaoning. It aims to enhance design efficiency and quality while promoting the inheritance and innovation development of local cultural heritage. The study employs CycleGAN combined with self-attention mechanisms to conduct style transfer experiments on cultural illustrations featuring Liaoning’s regional characteristics. It compares the performance of six models, including traditional GAN, CycleGAN, and CycleGAN + Self-attention, in terms of image quality and training efficiency. The results show that the CycleGAN + Self-attention model outperforms others in image quality indicators (PSNR and SSIM). On the Liaoning illustration dataset, this model achieves a PSNR of 30.5 dB and an SSIM of 0.96, which are 10 dB and 0.21 higher than traditional GANs. Tests across diverse datasets also demonstrate its robust generalization and adaptability. The proposed CycleGAN + Self-attention model performs well in illustration and cultural product design, generating high-quality illustrations with local cultural features. Beyond enhancing design efficiency, this model offers new technical means for cultural inheritance. Overall, this study furnishes novel ideas and methods for integrating intelligent GANs into art design practices. It helps promote Liaoning’s cultural heritage and innovation, and supports the development of the cultural and creative industry.},

  abstract={In recent years, there has been a proliferation of Edge Intelligence (EI) services, especially within Internet of Vehicles (IoV) scenarios, accompanied by a growing demand for multi-modal content generation. In response, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has emerged as a promising solution, equipping EI to produce diverse Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) for ubiquitous edge services. However, existing cloud-based GAI capabilities, which are mostly provided via the web and the Internet, introduce unacceptable latency overhead and heightened security risks for vehicular services. To address the above shortcomings and the lack of endogenous mechanisms for applying GAI to IoV scenarios, in this paper, we propose a layered vehicular GAI framework that seamlessly integrates GAI and EI. Within this framework, we devise a distributed collaborative inference mechanism between Road-Side Units (RSUs) and vehicles. Furthermore, we formulate the shared and local inference splitting problem, a pivotal challenge influencing both GAI service latency and content-generation capability. To tackle this issue, we introduce a backward induction-based algorithm, which enables the system can make splitting decisions using a simple threshold-based policy. Simulation results underscore the remarkable performance of the proposed system and vehicular collaborative inference mechanism, promising to facilitate diverse content generation within vehicular networks.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Data-driven fault diagnosis of high impedance fault (HIF) has received increasing attention and achieved fruitful results. However, HIF data is difficult to obtain in engineering. Furthermore, there exists an imbalance between the fault data and non-fault data, making data-driven methods hard to detect HIFs reliably under the small imbalanced sample condition. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel HIF diagnosis method based on conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WCGAN). By adversarial training, WCGAN can generate sufficient labeled zero-sequence current signals, which can expand the limited training set and achieve the balanced distribution of the samples. In addition, the Wasserstein distance was introduced to improve the loss function. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can generate high-quality samples and achieve a high accuracy rate of fault detection in the case of small imbalanced samples.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) trends vary significantly across global regions, shaping the trajectory of innovation, regulation, and societal impact. This variation influences how different regions approach AI development, balancing technological progress with ethical and regulatory considerations. This study conducts a comparative analysis of AI trends in the United States (US), the European Union (EU), and Asia, focusing on three key dimensions: generative AI, ethical oversight, and industrial applications. The US prioritizes market-driven innovation with minimal regulatory constraints, the EU enforces a precautionary risk-based framework emphasizing ethical safeguards, and Asia employs state-guided AI strategies that balance rapid deployment with regulatory oversight. Although these approaches reflect different economic models and policy priorities, their divergence poses challenges to international collaboration, regulatory harmonization, and the development of global AI standards. To address these challenges, this paper synthesizes regional strengths to propose an adaptive AI governance framework that integrates risk-tiered oversight, innovation accelerators, and strategic alignment mechanisms. By bridging governance gaps, this study offers actionable insights for fostering responsible AI development while ensuring a balance between technological progress, ethical imperatives, and regulatory coherence.},
