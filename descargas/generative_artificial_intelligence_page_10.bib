  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is transforming the financial services sector (FSS), offering innovative solutions and equipping the industry with cutting-edge tools to drive value creation and operational efficiency. While the sector-specific benefits of GAI technology are substantial, effectively harnessing these opportunities depends on addressing key institutional challenges, including systemic consequences, ethical concerns, and security and privacy risks. The highly regulated FSS is one of the critical infrastructures that plays a vital role in a country’s economic stability and national security, with cyberthreats posing significant risk to both. We assess the economic benefits of GAI technology, identify institutional challenges associated with its adoption, examine key regulatory initiatives, and outline a risk-mitigation framework. Our proposed solution to mitigate institutional challenges is twofold: 1) actionable institutional risk management safeguards, and 2) a baseline safety net for GAI implementation in the financial services sector.},

  abstract={Software-defined networks (SDNs) have fundamentally transformed the networking industry over the past decade, giving network operators unprecedented flexibility to customize network behavior and automate network operations without needing to rely on equipment vendor development cycles. At the same time, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has been taking the world by storm, enabling (among other things) big leaps in programmer productivity. SDNs involve a complex programming and significant implementation aspect that today, in many cases, still limits what the network operators can practically achieve. This makes GenAI seemingly an ideal complement for SDNs with the potential of taking it to the next level. But can it? Although the application of GenAI to SDNs indisputably holds considerable promise, many unique challenges are yet to be well understood and resolved to separate hype from reality.},

  abstract={This article explores the evolution of methods in human resource management (HRM), from traditional approaches to the integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI). Traditional HRM methods, such as structured interviews, psychometric tests, and annual appraisals, have long been foundational but are increasingly showing limitations in terms of efficiency and accuracy. Generative AI offers new opportunities to enhance recruitment, performance management, training, and employee development by enabling finer analyses and more informed decision-making. This study aims to compare these traditional and generative AI-based approaches, highlighting their impact on HR practices. The findings demonstrate that generative AI can significantly improve HR processes by providing more personalized and objective solutions, paving the way for a more efficient and adaptive HR framework. This research is relevant for both HR professionals seeking to modernize their practices and researchers interested in the intersection of AI and organizational development.},

  pages={98-105},
  abstract={This article highlights the potential of a prominent generative artificial intelligence (GAI) method, namely diffusion model (DM), for mobile communications. First, we propose a DM-driven communication architecture which introduces two key paradigms, that is, conditional DM, and DM-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL), for wireless data generation and communication management, respectively. Then, we discuss the key advantages of the DM-driven communication paradigms. To elaborate further, we explore DM-driven channel generation mechanisms for channel estimation, extrapolation, and feedback in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We showcase the numerical performance of conditional DM using the accurate DeepMIMO channel datasets, revealing its superiority in generating high-fidelity channels and mitigating unforeseen distribution shifts in sophisticated scenes. Furthermore, several DM-driven communication management designs promising to deal with imperfect channels and task-oriented communications are conceived. To inspire future research developments, we highlight the potential applications and open research challenges of DM-driven communications.

  abstract={ChatGPT, which has been discussed in public in recent years, was launched in November 2022, with a continuously expanding market size. Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has been developing rapidly in China. However, we have little knowledge of how well the GAIs are performing at answering course-related open questions, especially in Chinese. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the performances of GAIs in answering course-related open questions from both machine and manual evaluation perspectives. The results from this study showed that GAIs got unsatisfactory scores in this situation. Two different aspects of comparison of GAIs’ scores are discussed. More study on evaluating the performance of GAI is needed to investigate the capabilities of answering course-related open questions in the future.},

  abstract={Epidemic models have become increasingly useful, especially in the wake of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing the crucial role of human behavior in the spread of disease. There has been a recent rise in the usage and popularity of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), such as ChatGPT especially with its ability to mimic human behavior. In this study, we demonstrate a novel application of GenAI for epidemic modeling. We employed GenAI for creating agents living in a hypothetical town in simulations and simulating their behavior within the context of an ongoing pandemic. We performed a series of simulations to quantify the impact of agent traits and the availability of information for health condition, virus, and government guidelines on the disease spread patterns in terms of peak time and epidemic duration. We also characterized the most influential factors in agents' decision-making using random forest model.},

  pages={1-12},
  abstract={Urban populations are always on the increase, increasing the number of vehicles, leading to severe congestion, longer travel times, and substantial emergency vehicle response time delays. This paper presents a routing protocol for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), incorporating a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The proposed system utilizes BDI-based generative AI models, which rely on predefined logic and rules rather than machine learning to make real-time routing decisions. These decisions are based on data from vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, roadside units (RSUs) and IoT sensors, which integrate traffic density, congestion levels, collision avoidance and hazard detection. The system aims to optimize the accuracy of route selection, energy consumption, and communication latency. The simulation results, implemented using NS3 for real-world traffic scenarios, show improvements in route selection accuracy, collision avoidance, and energy efficiency compared to traditional routing methods. Specifically, the proposed system achieved a route selection accuracy of 95%, a collision avoidance rate of 95%, and reduced the communication latency to 105 ms, outperforming the other two methods. Furthermore, energy consumption was minimized and reduced to 85 J per route. These results highlight the potential of BDI-based routing with generative AI to improve ITS performance, particularly in real-time traffic management.},

  title={Understanding the Adoption of Generative Artificial Intelligence within Communities of Practice: A Cross-Practice, Machine Learning-Based Lexical Study}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1367-1374},
  abstract={Communities of Practice (CoPs) groups share knowledge and expertise across disciplinary collectives and industrial sectors. This theoretical construct assumes learning occurs in and across societal contexts where individuals mutually engage in collective, symbolically shared repertoires. Of late, CoPs have been explored regarding the use of technology platforms to enhance learning and to extend symbolically collective learning activities. However, the extensive and recent saturation of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) calls for inquiry into how CoPs understand and adopt this ubiquitous technology discussion relative to shared repertoires. This is especially true given the lack of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) research into GenAI adoption at scale. The present study seeks to uncover how the prominent CoPs of Finance, Art, and Software Development understand GenAI as they discuss their technology adoption practices in online forums. Specifically, more than 2.1 million words of community discussion were examined lexically to reveal the manner by which varied CoPs generate shared repertoires for their community members. Findings indicate that types of practice disciplines relate to the lexical dialectics of Practice/Technology, People/Replacements, and Authenticity/Inauthenticity, as well as insightful discourses regarding what counts as work and adoption. A first for HCI, CoPs, and GenAI research, this study provides additional suggestions for future CoPs symbolically shared repertoires relative to new technologies, as well as how GenAI may be implicated in the adoption, work, and learning-based praxes of heterogeneous disciplinary communities. “Where the artificiality of all that’s being created, the lack of that ‘spark’ that makes an image, a design, even the concept for a product will become so sterile, so overly tasteless that a new culture of ‘human generated content and products’ will become, first a contra-culture, and then a possible rebirth of what really makes our creation unique: That the things we make as humans are our own and nurture us as a species.” “It does not replace programmers, c’mon. It will make getting a job for those without prior experience much harder tho’. But generally speaking, it’s just a tool.”},

  abstract={Wireless channel modeling is critical to understanding and optimizing signal transmission. Wireless channels are influenced by many factors, including path loss, reflection, fading, and interference, making them complex and difficult to model and predict. Although some traditional wireless channel modeling methods are effective, they have limitations in handling complex multipath effects and nonlinear characteristics. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has the ability to generate robust data and therefore can be potentially used to model realistic wireless channel characteristics. However, there exist some challenges in GAI for wireless channel modeling, including physical layer network security issues, limited generalization ability, and the bandwidth consumption of centralized training. This article introduces a GAI-based wireless channel modeling framework, which leverages blockchain and federated learning to address efficiency, network security, and data privacy concerns in GAI channel modeling. Blockchain technology, through distributed ledgers and smart contracts, enables resource sharing and efficient utilization, enhancing computational efficiency and reducing network security risks. Federated learning allocates training tasks to different devices and nodes, thus allowing model training without centralizing data, protecting user privacy, and reducing network bandwidth usage. This article demonstrates the performance and effectiveness of the proposed framework through numerical results.},

  abstract={In the ever-growing field of Generative Artificial Intelligence, quick engineering has become a revolutionary method in the field of NLP for big language versions. This technique entails the manipulation of input queries to improve the quality and relation of the textual outputs of these models. New findings point to the fact that through the enhancement of the aspect of prompt engineering it could indeed be a way of significantly boosting LLM performance through a change of the input query format. This paper highlights the practical use of the prompt engineering concept to Tamil-based LLMs with an explicit purpose of developing a well-structured process capable of generating accurate and contextually relevant conversational responses. Thus, with subtle changes to how prompts are offered, this research aims to enhance the efficacy of Tamil LLMs that demand trivial data entry. The research uses the Query Transformation Module (QTM), which is an elaborate method developed to systematically change the input prompts into three forms of inquiries. Therefore, each format is built with objectives and key points in mind to enhance the understanding of the models as well as the results. To measure the effectiveness of this strategy, the QTM was employed with leading Tamil LLMs SKT GPT-2 and Tamil ChatGPT. We employed four different query methods in our experiments: all the initially employed unaltered request and three modified requests according to the QTM. The evaluation was made using Google SSA to fit the evaluation criteria of naturalness and specificity for the sentences generated by the models. Our experimental findings show that overall, there is a reasonable improvement in the performance by an average of 11 percent. Identified that there is an increase of 46% in the quality of generated sentences when using the transformed queries as compared to the unmodified prompts. This improvement also depicts how the QTM has an effectiveness of enhancing the performance of Tamil LLMs, resulting into its usability as a tool in the corresponding field of prompt engineering.},

Technological advancement is among the strategic objectives of the Kingdom, facilitating the achievement of the ambitious vision. GenAl's ability to undertake tasks like code generation, debugging, and documentation may threaten developers whose jobs could be replaced. However, instead of replacing software engineers, GenAl will create more opportunities for programmers, increase the demand for more experienced developers, and evolve the role of software engineers. While the benefits of GenAl in software engineering are immense, the Kingdom should address the ethical challenges, inadequate transparency, accountability problems, and data privacy issues. This paper recommends the establishment of a National AI Ethics Board, the government to mandate explainable AI (XAI), investments in more localised models like the Arabic Large Language Model (ALLaM), extensive training for GenAl engineers, cross-sector collaboration, and continuous monitoring.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is profoundly reshaping the educational ecosystem, driving the transition of education into a new era characterized by "human-machine" collaborative evolution. In this context, cultivating innovative talents with "machine-irreplaceable" capabilities has become increasingly imperative, as critical thinking, creativity, and related competencies are now regarded as essential attributes for college students in the intelligent era. Nevertheless, the impact of GAI on students' creativity remains a subject of debate within academia, with no consensus on whether it enhances or undermines creative potential. To address this gap, this study investigated the influence of the generative AI tool Kimi AI on creativity among 113 college students, utilizing a single-factor between-subjects experimental design. Creativity was operationalized through scores obtained from an alien-drawing task, a widely recognized measure of divergent thinking. The results demonstrate that GAI, when employed as a "learning companion," facilitates sustained interaction with students, thereby effectively fostering the development of their creative abilities. As the transition from weak AI to strong AI progresses, a critical challenge in the intelligent era lies in determining how to effectively integrate GAI into educational frameworks to enhance not only creativity but also other core competencies essential for future-ready graduates.},

  abstract={The swift progress of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), notably large language models (LLMs), is reshaping the digital landscape. Recognizing this transformative potential, the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) launched a pilot initiative to explore the integration of GenAI techniques into its daily operation for performance excellence, where 22 projects were launched in May 2024. Within these projects, this article presents the development of the intelligent agent Pubbie as a case study, targeting the automation of performance measurement, data management, and insight reporting at the NRC. Cutting-edge techniques are explored, including LLM orchestration and semantic embedding via RoBERTa, while strategic fine-tuning and few-shot learning approaches are incorporated to infuse domain knowledge at an affordable cost. The user-friendly interface of Pubbie allows general government users to input queries in natural language and easily upload or download files with a simple button click, greatly reducing manual efforts and accessibility barriers.},

  abstract={Semantic communication (SemCom), a pioneering paradigm that places emphasis on conveying the meaning of information, faces challenges in constructing background knowledge to drive precise reasoning of semantic coding models. Fortunately, the recent emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) technology is promising to create high-quality content that can be harnessed to assist knowledge construction in SemCom, enhancing the reasoning ability of semantic coding models. In this letter, we propose a GAI-assisted SemCom framework, named Gen-SC, where sufficient samples for training SemCom transceivers are generated using GAI as per user contextual information. In addition, to guide the GAI model in producing contextually relevant content, a discriminator is incorporated into Gen-SC to measure the disparity between generated samples and actual samples. The simulation results demonstrate that the Gen-SC achieves higher semantic accuracy, especially when the original training samples are insufficient, in contrast to traditional SemCom without knowledge enhancement.},
