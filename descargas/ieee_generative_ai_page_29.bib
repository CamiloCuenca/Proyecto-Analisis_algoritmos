  abstract={In the past year, ChatGPT has surfaced as a formidable and transformative force, challenging, and reshaping conventional paradigms across diverse tasks. This research investigates the potential of ChatGPT 3.5, a Generative Pre-trained Transformer, as an innovative tool in coding education, focusing on the delivery of accurate instructional content. Previous research has led us to investigate more AI capabilities with application to the production of learning resources, evaluating ChatGPT's proficiency in completing a digital circuit design laboratory, with the notable result being that ChatGPT achieved a score of 73% on the laboratory assignments. Further delving into its tutoring capabilities, ChatGPT was utilized as a tutor in a Java coding class, where students were permitted to employ ChatGPT as a learning aid. The outcome was compelling, as after students were able to use ChatGPT as a tutor, the average score was 93.325%. This success not only demonstrated the model's adaptability but also highlighted its potential as a valuable resource for students seeking academic support. Central to this new step on the research is the assessment of ChatGPT 3.5's proficiency in understanding Verilog, a sophisticated programming language used in digital systems design. This research is conducted within the context of the Digital Systems Design in Aerospace (CEC330) course at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and involves the use of ChatGPT to create detailed laboratory manuals for the class. In this exploration, ChatGPT was tasked with synthesizing informative laboratory manuals by utilizing a provided Verilog code solution. The findings demonstrate the capability of ChatGPT to accurately interpret code and transform it into coherent laboratory instructions. The implications of this study extend to educators, providing them with a powerful tool for crafting clear and comprehensive laboratory instructions for multiple programming classes. This innovative approach has the potential to significantly enhance the instructional experience, enabling professors and teachers to deliver precise guidance to students undertaking coding-related laboratory assignments.},

  title={Generative AI for OCL Constraint Generation: Dataset Collection and LLM Fine-tuning}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={The Object Constraint Language (OCL) is a formal specification language in model-based systems and software engineering. It defines complex rules and constraints for model-based system design and verification. Constructing an OCL constraint requires expertise not only in OCL syntax but also in meta-model information, which can hinder its application in the practical industrial scenario despite its broad usage. Recently, generative artificial intelligence has demonstrated remarkable performance in code and text generation. This work discusses the generation of OCL constraints from natural language specifications using large language models (LLMs). Given that the automotive and aviation industries are major consumers of model-based engineering, the use of commercial LLMs raises concerns about data privacy. Therefore, we propose to employ open-source and locally deployed LLMs for OCL generation tasks. In this work, we collected a set of meta-models and OCL constraints, which were syntactically validated to ensure the quality of the OCL dataset. Synthetic natural language specifications were generated and used in the dataset for model fine-tuning. Additionally, we designed a retrieval-augmented approach to incorporate meta-model information during LLM fine-tuning and OCL generation. The proposed fine-tuning and OCL generation approach has been experimented with the state-of-the-art open-source LLM, Llama 3 8B. The locally fine-tuned and deployed language model achieved comparable syntactic accuracy and a higher semantic similarity score for OCL generation compared to the cutting-edge commercial models, GPT-4 Turbo and Gemini 1.5 Pro. The usability of the fine-tuned model has been demonstrated for OCL generation in the context of automotive resource allocation.},

  abstract={The proliferation of deepfakes-also termed artificial intelligence-generated synthetic media poses unprecedented challenges to the digital authenticity of media, for media integrity, and to societiesâ€™ trust in its credibility. Despite such significant technological advancements, current methodologies for detecting deepfakes remain somewhat fragmented, reactive, and often unable to keep pace with rapidly evolving technologies in generative AI. This article considers a comprehensive multi-modal approach toward deepfake detection by integrating an advanced machine learning algorithm, novel statistical correlation techniques, and forensic image analysis that would fill in the critical gaps in the existing frameworks. By using an extensive dataset of 10,000 synthetic and authentic media samples from diverse domains, we developed a hybrid neural network architecture that attained 94.3% accuracy on identifying AI-generated content. Our methodology utilized ensemble learning by combining spatial-temporal inconsistency detection, biological signal analysis, and advanced feature extraction algorithms. Key findings demonstrate significant vulnerabilities in current deepfake generation models, with our proposed technique successfully identifying subtle artifacts and inconsistencies across multiple generative AI platforms. This research conclusively demonstrates that proactive, adaptive detection strategies are critical to mitigating the potential risks associated with synthetic media, providing a robust framework for future technological interventions in digital forensics and media authentication.},

  title={Rethinking Strategic Mechanism Design In The Age Of Large Language Models: New Directions For Communication Systems}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-9},
  abstract={This paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs) in designing strategic mechanisms - including auctions, contracts, and games- for specific purposes in communication networks. Traditionally, strategic mechanism design in telecommunications has relied on human expertise to craft solutions based on game theory, auction theory, and contract theory. However, the evolving landscape of telecom networks, characterized by increasing abstraction, emerging use cases, and novel value creation opportunities, calls for more adaptive and efficient approaches. We propose leveraging LLMs to automate or semi-automate the process of strategic mechanism design, from intent specification to final formulation. This paradigm shift introduces both semi-automated and fully-automated design pipelines, raising crucial questions about faithfulness to intents, incentive compatibility, algorithmic stability, and the balance between human oversight and artificial intelligence (AI) autonomy. The paper discusses potential frameworks, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems, to implement LLMdriven mechanism design in communication networks contexts. We examine key challenges, including LLM limitations in capturing domain-specific constraints, ensuring strategy proofness, and integrating with evolving telecom standards. By providing an in-depth analysis of the synergies and tensions between LLMs and strategic mechanism design within the IoT ecosystem, this work aims to stimulate discussion on the future of AI-driven information economic mechanisms in telecommunications and their potential to address complex, dynamic network management scenarios.},

  title={Density-Aware Haze Image Synthesis by Self-Supervised Content-Style Disentanglement}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={32},
  number={7},
  pages={4552-4572},
  abstract={The key procedure of haze image synthesis with adversarial training lies in the disentanglement of the feature involved only in haze synthesis, i.e., the style feature, from the feature representing the invariant semantic content, i.e., the content feature. Previous methods introduced a binary classifier to constrain the domain membership from being distinguished through the learned content feature during the training stage, thereby the style information is separated from the content feature. However, we find that these methods cannot achieve complete content-style disentanglement. The entanglement of the flawed style feature with content information inevitably leads to the inferior rendering of haze images. To address this issue, we propose a self-supervised style regression model with stochastic linear interpolation that can suppress the content information in the style feature. Ablative experiments demonstrate the disentangling completeness and its superiority in density-aware haze image synthesis. Moreover, the synthesized haze data are applied to test the generalization ability of vehicle detectors. Further study on the relation between haze density and detection performance shows that haze has an obvious impact on the generalization ability of vehicle detectors and that the degree of performance degradation is linearly correlated to the haze density, which in turn validates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},

  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Super-resolution (SR) of remote sensing imagery based on generative AI models is vital for practical applications such as urban planning and disaster assessment. However, current approaches suffer from poor performance trade-offs among the pivotal, yet competing, objectives: perceptual quality, factual accuracy, and inference speed. To break through this limitation, we propose a novel and high-performing two-stage SR framework for the remote sensing imagery based on a generative diffusion model. First, in Stage 1, factually grounded base images are generated by employing a guidance-free diffusion process relying solely on the original low-resolution images, such that the risk of semantic hallucination can be effectively mitigated. The generated images are refined subsequently in Stage 2 such that high-frequency details for SR quality can be restored via our customized and innovative guidance mechanism with a visionâ€“language model (VLM) and a ControlNet, and a dynamic inference acceleration technique is applied to ensure efficiency. Extensive experimental results confirm that our proposed framework excels in perceptual qualityâ€”achieving top CLIP-IQA scoresâ€”and in structural integrity while achieving robust performance. In particular, it enables reliable, high-fidelity SR for large-scale, real-world remote sensing pipelines by surpassing the conventional fidelityâ€“hallucination trade-off at practical inference speed.

  abstract={One of the negative effects of urbanization and population increase in developing nations is air pollution. As a result, the Air Quality Index (AQI) is assessed in a descriptive system that serves as a medium for informing the public about the danger of pollution. Thus, a deep learning system automates the assessment of air contaminants using time series data. Over the years, one of the most often used linear models in time series forecasting has been the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been the subject of recent study into forecasting, and these studies indicate that ANNs may prove to be a viable substitute for more conventional linear methods. In order to take advantage on the distinct advantages of ARIMA and ANN models in linear and nonlinear modelling, a hybrid methodology combining both models are presented in this study. This study made use of the data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository 2017. The primary objective of the Long Short-Term Model (LSTM), which is used for classification, is to improve accuracy in the vicinity of the test point. Based on the findings, the suggested ARIMA-ANN model outperforms the current model in terms of accuracy. The combined model can be an efficient means of enhancing the predicting accuracy attained by either of the models employed separately, according to the study results with the given data sets.},

  year={2020},
  volume={17},

  pages={1973-1977},
  abstract={Recently, convolutional neural networks have shown superior performance in single-image superresolution. Although existing mean-square-error-based methods achieve high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), they tend to generate oversmooth results. Generative adversarial network (GAN)-based methods can provide high-resolution (HR) images with higher perceptual quality, but produce pseudotextures in images, which generally leads to lower PSNR. Besides, different regions in remote sensing images (RSIs) reflect discrepant surface topography and visual characteristics. This means a uniform reconstruction strategy may not be suitable for all targets in RSIs. To solve these problems, we propose a novel saliency-discriminated GAN for RSI superresolution. First, hierarchical weakly supervised saliency analysis is introduced to compute a saliency map, which is subsequently employed to distinguish the diverse demands of regions in the following generator and discriminator part. Different from previous GANs, the proposed residual dense saliency generator takes saliency maps as a supplementary condition in the generator. Simultaneously, combining the characteristic of RSIs, we design a new paired discriminator to enhance the perceptual quality, which measures the distance between generated images and HR images in salient areas and nonsalient areas, respectively. Comprehensive evaluations validate the superiority of the proposed model.},

  abstract={Fluorescence microscopy is a key driving force behind advances in modern life sciences. However, due to constraints in image formation and acquisition, to obtain high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) fluorescence images remains difficult. Strong noise negatively affects not only visual observation but also downstream analysis. To address this problem, we propose a blind global noise modeling denoiser (GNMD) that simulates image noise globally using a generative adversarial network (GAN). No prior information on noise properties is required. And no clean training targets need to be provided for noisy inputs. Instead, by simulating real image noise using a GAN, our method synthesizes paired noisy and clean images for training a denoising deep learning network. Experiments on real fluorescence microscopy images show that our method substantially outperforms competing state-of-the-art methods, especially in suppressing background noise. Denoising using our method also facilitates downstream image segmentation.},

The augmented datasets were subsequently used to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification. Comprehensive evaluation metrics (accuracy, recall, precision, Fl-score, AUC, IS, and FID) were employed to assess the performance of the generated images and the trained models. Results indicate that CDC-GAN exhibited the highest classification accuracy and MCC, while AC-GAN excelled in ROC-AUC, precision, and recall.

  volume={},

  pages={0055-0062},
  abstract={The applicability of visible spectrum cameras is limited to nighttime and extreme weather conditions. To overcome these limitations, infrared (IR) cameras were introduced, but their images lack luminance and representation quality, limiting the analytical ability and response time of humans. To be understandable by humans, image enhancement is not sufficient; conversion to visible RGB format is required, and this process is popularly known as colorization. However, the thermal infrared (TIR) images are low in both luminance and chrominance in comparison to grayscale images, which are only low in chrominance. Therefore, TIR colorization needs image-to-image translation; simple color transfer is not enough. In this paper, we investigated and modified one of the most commonly used conditional generative adversarial networks, known as pix2pixHD GAN for TIR-to-visible RGB translation. We are proposing a new composite loss function with noise augmentation in training. The improvement in the average values of NRMSE, PSNR, LPIPS, and NIQE is observed when compared with the state-of-the-art on the publicly available KAIST dataset. The results of the extensive experiments proved the effectiveness of the proposed method for TIR colorization, which is shown using both subjective (visual) and objective assessments for evaluation of image quality.},

  abstract={Space imagery is critical for astronomical research and satellite observations, but it often suffers from noise and artifacts, such as streaks caused by cosmic rays and sensor imperfections. Traditional denoising techniques frequently compromise essential features like stars, leading to a loss of valuable information. This paper introduces Stellar Cleanse, a pioneering framework that leverages CosmicNet for superior denoising of space imagery. CosmicNet integrates several advanced techniques: frequency domain preprocessing with Fourier Transform and low-pass filtering, a customized convolutional neural network (CNN) for residual noise learning, attention mechanisms for streak detection and preservation of stars, Total Variation (TV) Minimization for edge retention, and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for final image refinement. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that CosmicNet significantly outperforms traditional methods in both quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM) and qualitative assessments, effectively reducing noise while preserving critical celestial features. This groundbreaking approach not only enhances image clarity but also holds promise for broader applications in astronomical imaging and beyond.},

  abstract={Recently generative adversarial network (GAN) has been explored to multimodal template matching. Existing GAN-based multimodal template matching methods exploit the image generation to transform the multimodal template matching task as the unimodal one. However, image synthesis-based multimodal template matching methods relay on the generated image quality, which is unstable. Towards this end, this paper proposes a feature adversarial network, which maps different modal images into a common subspace and learns the correlation in the subspace. Specifically, the feature mapper is designed to map the multimodal features into intermediate features, and the modality discriminator is proposed to optimize the multimodal intermediate features until they are indistinguishable. Thus, an effective common feature subspace is generated for correlation learning. The experimental results on a public dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Stomach Adenocarcinoma (STAD) significantly impacts global cancer mortality rates. Recent strides in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have primarily harnessed imaging techniques like CT, X-rays, PET, and MRI for cancer detection. Concurrently, the rapidly growing volume of genomic big data presents an untapped reservoir for identifying genetic mutations characteristic of STAD. Our research explores this avenue by examining gene amino acid sequences altered by STAD. We employ physical properties of amino acids, i.e., Electro-Ion Interaction Pseudopotential (EIIP) values and Kidera factors in feature extraction, a novel strategy in STAD diagnostics. To address the issue of class imbalance, we incorporate generative AI to produce additional data samples. Addressing the privacy and security challenges associated with data centralization in healthcare, we propose Fed_ANN11, an artificial neural network (ANN) model developed in a federated environment following an initial deployment as ANN11. Our model demonstrates remarkable accuracy in both simple and federated environments with extracted feature sets, namely, EIIP-based and Kidera factors-based. We found that EIIP-based features eclipse Kidera factors in performance. In a simple setting, the proposed model achieved a testing accuracy of 86% and a training accuracy of 88% for STAD detection using the EIIP-based feature set. In a federated environment, it achieved an accuracy of 0.94% in testing and 0.99% in training for STAD detection using the EIIP-based feature set.

  abstract={Semantic Communication (SC), which focuses on transmitting meaning rather than raw data, has emerged as the next-generation communication paradigm. However, the performance of SC is heavily influenced by network design and training methodologies. To address these challenges and enhance SC performance at the edge, we first introduce a Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI)-assisted SC (GSC) model, which improves SC capabilities by optimizing the network architecture. Then, to achieve the efficient learning of GSC models deployed on each user, a Personalized Semantic Federated Learning (PSFL) framework is proposed. Specifically, in the local training phase, a Personalized Local Distillation (PLD) approach is employed, where each user selects a tailored GSC model as a mentor based on local resources. This mentor subsequently distills knowledge to a unified student model, ensuring compliance with the model isomorphism requirements of FL. In the global aggregation phase, an Adaptive Global Pruning (AGP) scheme is applied, dynamically pruning or expanding the aggregated global model based on real-time channel conditions. This mechanism effectively balances accuracy and communication energy efficiency. Finally, numerical results validate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed PSFL framework, demonstrating its potential to enhance SC performance in edge environments significantly.},

  abstract={It is becoming the leading solution for bringing back the lost or damaged digital images, which are crucial for keeping history and culture alive. In this work, the state-of-art Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), including CycleGAN and Pix2Pix, as well as diffusion models, have been explored for the first time in the area of historical image enhancement. The datasets are collected from the public domain; they are the Library of Congress and Old Picture repositories for training and testing the models. As illustrated by the framework under consideration, the fine details are reconstructed and noise is minimized when compared to other major approaches, thus the legibility and aesthetic quality of historical items are improved. The approach combines up-to-date machine learning algorithms with conventional image processing techniques thus maximizing the amount of the original content to be restored while at the same time maximizing the restoration quality. TensorFlow and PyTorch significantly help in the building of complex network structures and shorten the time for restoration. Thus, this work is relevant in this context as it discusses a professionally oriented scalable and robust realisation of digital archiving and restoration and opens up future ways to develop an integration of AI-based methodologies into the preservation of cultural heritage.},

  title={Natural and Imperceptible Backdoor Attack against Deep Neural Networks}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={377-381},
  abstract={Over the past few years, deep learning has demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of applications. As the same time, researchers have become increasingly concerned with ensuring the security of deep learning models. Specifically, backdoor attacks have emerged as a significant threat to Deep Learning Model, whereby attackers control the predictions of model by implanting a concealed backdoor into the model. Under this scenario, the backdoored model will appear to make normal predictions on clean images, but will exhibit abnormal behaviors when the trigger is presented. Many existing backdoor attacks utilize a fixed pattern as the trigger, which can be easily detected by defense methods or even humans. Furthermore, existing backdoor attack methods are rarely targeted specifically at the Vision Transformer (ViT) model. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel natural backdoor attack method. We exploit natural phenomena to carry out a backdoor attack called the fog backdoor attack, which can utilize fog in the natural world as a trigger to be seamlessly integrated into clean images without being perceived by humans. The generated fog will diffuse over the image, creating a natural-looking effect. In contrast to the fixed and limited triggers produced by other methods, our triggers are more natural and imperceptible. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed backdoor attack on different models. Specifically, the attack success rate of the proposed backdoor attack is 98.85% on VGG-16 model, 99.44% on ResNet-18 model and 9S.56% on ViT model, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed attack does not compromise the clean accuracy of the model.},

  abstract={The need for improved diagnostic methods in ophthalmology is acute, especially in the underdeveloped regions with limited access to specialists and advanced equipment. Therefore, we introduce VisionUnite, a novel vision-language foundation model for ophthalmology enhanced with clinical knowledge. VisionUnite has been pretrained on an extensive dataset comprising 1.24 million image-text pairs, and further refined using our proposed MMFundus dataset, which includes 296,379 high-quality fundus image-text pairs and 889,137 simulated doctor-patient dialogue instances. Our experiments indicate that VisionUnite outperforms existing generative foundation models such as GPT4V and Gemini Pro. It also demonstrates diagnostic capabilities comparable to junior ophthalmologists. VisionUnite performs well in various clinical scenarios including open-ended multidisease diagnosis, clinical explanation, and patient interaction, making it a highly versatile tool for initial ophthalmic disease screening. VisionUnite can also serve as an educational aid for junior ophthalmologists, accelerating their acquisition of knowledge regarding both common and underrepresented ophthalmic conditions. VisionUnite represents a significant advancement in ophthalmology, with broad implications for diagnostics, medical education, and understanding of disease mechanisms.

  abstract={Due to keystroke dynamics's reliability and effi-ciency, it has been widely used in multi-factor authentication schemes by enterprises for robust user authentication, hence enhancing online service security. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel methodology designed not only to enhance user authentication but also to detect imposter users who are trying to get unauthorized access. Our methodology uses transfer learning and conditional tabular generative adversarial networks (CTGAN)-based keystroke dynamics, and consists of a four-step process; mitigating outliers that hinder the model's performance through utilizing quantile transformation (QT), employing data augmentation through CTGAN, converting CSV data into 3D images, and concatenating features from three accurate transfer learning models (VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121) followed by dense layers to detecting im-poster users accurately and hence making precise decisions to enhance the user authentication process. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our methodology using the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) keystroke dynamics benchmark dataset that contains real typing patterns, and the results demonstrate superior security performance and robustness using our methodology by achieving an accuracy of 99.99% and equal error rate (EER) of 1 %, thereby, outperforming the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract={There are many methods for generating adversarial samples. However, most methods do not achieve considerable performances both in the attack accuracy and image realism. In this paper, we generate adversarial samples based on the improved generative adversarial network SAdvGAN. For generator, multidimensional feature fusion is adopted to generate high-quality noises. For discriminator, self-attention is introduced to encourage model to focus on features which benefit the discrimination process. After training with Relativistic average GANs(RaGANs), it reduces the probability of real samples being identified as true. Compared with the current mainstream attack strategies, adversarial samples generated by SAdvGAN perform well in terms of perceived similarity. Concretely, the success rates of SAdvGAN in the semi-white box setting on MNIST and CIFAR10 is higher than that of AdvGAN by 9.68% and 6.1% respectively.},

  abstract={Imagine a system that takes in a line of text and generates realistic images of faces, the sort of challenge AI researchers have been trying to crack for some time now. In this paper, a new way of achieving this vision has been defined which was never been possible before due to the computational limitations, but that is now feasible due to the advent of deep learning technology. A model that blends Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is created which is capable of generating very realistic human faces only from textual descriptions. The CGAN takes the textual input and creates rough facial images, and the CNN fine-tune these images to have a more natural appearance while still being faithful to the original text. This model is trained on a dataset of paired facial images and textual descriptions. The model can consequently generate varied, high-quality images that closely match the input text as a result of being trained on this extensive dataset. This method was assessed through both human feedback and quantitative measures. These results show major improvement in generated text-to-face, paving the way for applications in graphics, virtual reality, entertainment and identifying criminal activities in cyberspace. But alongside this powerful new technology comes an ethical responsibility to protect oneself from the misuse of it for cybercrimes.},

Since then, there has been significant growth in adversarial networks. New break-throughs and innovative approaches in generative adversarial networks can radically elevate and increase the quality of synthetically generated images by extracting patterns from the original datasets. Among the major advancements of GAN, image synthesis is the most prominent and extensively studied appli-cation. The concept of adversarial training, where two neural networks compete against each other, has introduced a novel paradigm for learning complex patterns in the Images.

Aiming at contributing towards a solution to this demand, this work describes a modular co-simulation methodology called CAVIAR, for implementing the virtual counterpart of a digital twin (DT) system. Here, CAVIAR is upgraded to support a message passing library and facilitate using different 6G-related simulators. The main contributions of this work are the detailed description of different CAVIAR architectures, the implementation of this methodology to assess a 6G use case of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based search and rescue (SAR), and the generation of benchmarking data about the computational resource usage. For executing the SAR co-simulation we adopt five open-source solutions: 1) the physical and link level network simulator Sionna; 2) the simulator for autonomous vehicles AirSim; 3) scikit-learn for training a decision tree for multiple inputâ€“multiple output (MIMO) beam selection; 4) Yolov8 for the detection of rescue targets; and 5) neural autonomic transport system (NATS) for message passing. Results for the implemented SAR use case suggest that the methodology can run in a single machine, with the main demanded resources being the CPU processing and the GPU memory.},

  abstract={Deep learning for change detection is one of the current hot topics in the field of remote sensing. However, most end-to-end networks are proposed for supervised change detection, and unsupervised change detection models depend on traditional pre-detection methods. Therefore, we proposed a fully convolutional change detection framework with generative adversarial network, to unify unsupervised, weakly supervised, regional supervised, and fully supervised change detection tasks into one end-to-end framework. A basic Unet segmentor is used to obtain change detection map, an image-to-image generator is implemented to model the spectral and spatial variation between multi-temporal images, and a discriminator for changed and unchanged is proposed for modeling the semantic changes in weakly and regional supervised change detection task. The iterative optimization of segmentor and generator can build an end-to-end network for unsupervised change detection, the adversarial process between segmentor and discriminator can provide the solutions for weakly and regional supervised change detection, the segmentor itself can be trained for fully supervised task. The experiments indicate the effectiveness of the propsed framework in unsupervised, weakly supervised and regional supervised change detection. This article provides new theorical definitions for unsupervised, weakly supervised and regional supervised change detection tasks with the proposed framework, and shows great potentials in exploring end-to-end network for remote sensing change detection (https://github.com/Cwuwhu/FCD-GAN-pytorch).},

  pages={1173-1183},
  abstract={Electric Vehicle (EV) demand modeling constitutes the cornerstone of studies aiming to facilitate the integration of EVs into the power system. The different characteristics of the EV demand (departure time, arrival time, and electric demand), as well as the correlation between thereof, render EV demand modeling a complex task. The Majority of previous methods, which were developed based on the Monte Carlo simulation, are unable to observe and preserve the correlation between EV demand characteristics; because, in these methods, the EV demand characteristics are generated separately in an unsupervised manner. This study proposes a novel semi-supervised EV demand modeling approach by mapping the different EV demand characteristics into a three-dimensional (3D) space as a 3D image. To effectively realize the 3D EV demand modeling, we have employed Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with a 3D convolutional structure to develop EV-GANS networkâ€”a GANs structure tailored to the needs of EV demand modeling in environments hosting high demand diversity such as EV charging stations. Numerical results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed EV-GANS in estimating the trend of the actual EV demand on the test day with a small error margin compared to the existing benchmark generation-based methods (Monte Carlo and Copula).},

  year={2024},
  volume={12},
  number={},
  pages={146749-146770},
  abstract={The security of stego-images is a crucial foundation for analyzing steganography algorithms. Recently, steganography has made significant strides in ongoing conflicts with steganalysis. In order to increase the security of stego-images, steganography must be able to evade detection using steganalysis methods. Secret information is typically hidden using traditional embedding-based steganography, which inevitably leaves traces of the modifications that can be found using more sophisticated machine-learning-based steganalysis techniques. Steganography without embedding (SWE) outperforms machine-learning-based steganalysis techniques because it does not require alteration of the data of the cover image. A novel image SWE method based on deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (GANs) is proposed to synthesize stego-images led by embedded text. The variational autoencoder (VAE) in the GAN model is utilized to synthesize the stego-image, based on interpolating the secret text in a continuous variable representation of the cover image. To further improve the frameworkâ€™s performance and shorten processing times, the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is used to identify the optimal VAE structure. When creating a stego-image, no embedding or modification procedures are required, and after training, a different convolutional neural network (CNN) known as the extractor can correctly extract the data from the image. The experimental results revealed that this approach has the advantages of evading detection using innovative deep learning (DL) steganalysis architecture and accurate information extraction.},

  abstract={Spina bifida is a congenital neurological condition caused by the incomplete closure of the spinal cord during fetal development, potentially leading to severe complications such as permanent paralysis if untreated. Early and accurate detection is critical for timely intervention, with ultrasonography serving as the gold standard for fetal monitoring. This research employs a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to detect spina bifida by utilizing clinical features such as gestational age, maternal age, spinal lesion size, and head circumference. The cGAN architecture comprises a generator that synthesizes realistic feature sets conditioned on spina bifida presence and a discriminator that classifies the condition while distinguishing between real and synthetic data. Adversarial training, combined with careful normalization and preprocessing of the input data, ensures the generation of clinically relevant synthetic datasets that enhance diversity and robustness. This approach augments limited real-world data, facilitating robust classification and underscoring the potential of cGANs in advancing data-driven prenatal diagnostics and improving early spina bifida detection.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The field of cybersecurity has witnessed a growth in the breadth and intricacy of cyber threats due to the advancement of communication technology, which calls for the implementation of strong network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Regrettably, a wide range of potential hazards might put computer users at risk when using the Internet. Users stand to lose a great deal, including control over machines, private information, and potentially even identity theft. The ongoing problem of inconsistent and changing threat data persists despite notable improvements in NIDS models. As more and more research has realized the need for improved detection skills, artificial intelligence (AI) has become a viable answer. In order to meet the challenges presented by emerging cyber threats, this study presents a thorough investigation into the integration of AI, specifically generative adversarial networks (GANs), into NIDS. GANs are a machine learning breakthrough that provides a fresh method for creating new data instances that closely mimic real data. This skill is especially useful in the context of network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), where identifying anomalies necessitates a sophisticated comprehension of intricate and dynamic threat patterns. Our study expands on earlier research in the field that mostly concentrated on deep learning methods like autoencoders, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and long short-term neural networks (LSTM), as well as conventional machine learning models like decision trees (DT) and support vector machines (SVM). Although these methods have shown potential, there hasnâ€™t been much of a practical use for them in actual NIDS systems. A promising approach to improving NIDS performance is provided by the suggested NIDS makes use of GANs, especially when it comes to anomaly detection. Through the creation of artificial data instances that closely resemble real-world threats, GANs can enhance the resilience and flexibility of NIDS in dynamic threat settings.},

The initial emotional perturbation between teachers have calmed and the intellectual reasoning overcome the fear of unknown. In 2023 our survey shows that the teachers correctly recognised the AI systems in the background of their online activities. Our research (survey analysis) has shown that 81% of teachers use Chat GPT and that 66% of the teachers are aware of the AI system behind Office 365. The most problematic feature for the teacher is the recognition of authorship of the text where more than 70% have doubts. Despite most of the teachers feels discomfort about AI the reality is not dark. The teachers know that students do not know to how to evaluate the data. Therefore, AI generated results of the studentsâ€™ assignments could be easily identified if the students do not understand the text provided by the AI. From the data and the educated reasoning, we can conclude that education processes would need to change in the near future but learning would remain the same. We would need to address the ethical topics of using AI in the education and educate students what is right and what is wrong.},

This approach redefines traditional roles in education, assigning students the responsibility of acting as educators. They develop teaching materials, quizzes, and lessons, leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) as a supportive and interactive tool. The instructorâ€™s role shifts to that of a facilitator, guiding students through a structured, phase-based process and integrating AI tools to enhance the collaborative and engaging learning experience. The primary objective of this methodology is to explore how role reversal and active engagement with AI can support deeper comprehension, improved knowledge retention, and greater awareness of GenAIâ€™s appropriate and responsible use. By placing students at the center of content creation and decision-making, the "Flipped Role" aims to foster a collaborative and reflective educational environment while demonstrating the practical potential of AI-enhanced active learning.},

  abstract={When people communicate in noisy environments with the phone, it is difficult for listeners to obtain information even if the device outputs clear speech. Previous studies have focused on speech intelligibility enhancement (IENH) via normal speech and different levels of Lombard speech conversion. However, these methods often lead to speech distortion and impair the overall speech quality. We propose an IENH framework based on an improved Star Generative Adversarial Network (StarGAN) named D2StarGAN. It has two main advantages: 1) Inspired by the dual-discriminator idea, we add a speech metric discriminator based on StarGAN to optimize multiple intelligibility-related metrics simultaneously; 2) The framework can adapt to different far-and-near-end noise levels and different noise types. Experimental results using both objective measurements and subjective listening tests indicate that the proposed method outperforms the baseline method. It adaptively converts all the mobile communication scenarios with far-and-near-end noise, thus making IENH more widely used in practice.},

  abstract={Since the release of Sora, the text-to-video (T2V) generation has brought profound changes to artificial intelligence-generated content. T2V generation aims to generate high-quality videos based on a given text description, which is challenging due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality text-video pairs for training and the complexity of modeling high-dimensional video data. Although there have been some valuable and impressive surveys on T2V generation, these surveys introduce approaches in a relatively isolated way, lack the development of evaluation metrics, and lack the latest advances in T2V generation since 2023. Due to the rapid expansion of the field of T2V generation, a comprehensive review of the relevant studies is both necessary and challenging. This survey attempts to connect and systematize existing research in a comprehensive way. Unlike previous surveys, this survey reviews nearly one hundred representative T2V generation approaches and includes the latest method published on July 2024 from the perspectives of model, data, evaluation metrics, and available open source. It may help readers better understand the current research status and ideas and have a quick start with accessible open-source models. Finally, the future challenges and method trends of T2V generation are thoroughly discussed.},

  pages={1184-1199},
  abstract={Real-world face super-resolution (SR) is a highly ill-posed image restoration task. The fully-cycled Cycle-GAN architecture is widely employed to achieve promising performance on face SR, but is prone to produce artifacts upon challenging cases in real-world scenarios, since joint participation in the same degradation branch will impact final performance due to huge domain gap between real-world and synthetic LR ones obtained by generators. To better exploit the powerful generative capability of GAN for real-world face SR, in this paper, we establish two independent degradation branches in the forward and backward cycle-consistent reconstruction processes, respectively, while the two processes share the same restoration branch. Our Semi-Cycled Generative Adversarial Networks (SCGAN) is able to alleviate the adverse effects of the domain gap between the real-world LR face images and the synthetic LR ones, and to achieve accurate and robust face SR performance by the shared restoration branch regularized by both the forward and backward cycle-consistent learning processes. Experiments on two synthetic and two real-world datasets demonstrate that, our SCGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on recovering the face structures/details and quantitative metrics for real-world face SR. The code will be publicly released at https://github.com/HaoHou-98/SCGAN.},

  abstract={Image-based virtual try-on systems have significant commercial value in online garment shopping. However, prior methods fail to appropriately handle details, so are defective in maintaining the original appearance of organizational items including arms, the neck, and in-shop garments. We propose a novel high fidelity virtual try-on network to generate realistic results. Specifically, a distributed pipeline is used for simultaneous generation of organizational items. First, the in-shop garment is warped using thin plate splines (TPS) to give a coarse shape reference, and then a corresponding target semantic map is generated, which can adaptively respond to the distribution of different items triggered by different garments. Second, organizational items are componentized separately using our novel semantic map-based image adjustment network (SMIAN) to avoid interference between body parts. Finally, all components are integrated to generate the overall result by SMIAN. A priori dual-modal information is incorporated in the tail layers of SMIAN to improve the convergence rate of the network. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can retain better details of condition information than current methods. Our method achieves convincing quantitative and qualitative results on existing benchmark datasets.},

  pages={981-986},
  abstract={As people become more aware of their food choices, food computation models have become increasingly popular in assisting people in maintaining healthy eating habits. For example, food recommendation systems analyze recipe instructions to assess nutritional contents and provide recipe recommendations. The recent and remarkable successes of generative AI methods, such as auto-regressive Large Language Models, can enable robust methods for a more comprehensive understanding of recipes for healthy food recommendations beyond surface-level nutrition content assessments. In this study, we investigate the use of generative AI methods to extend current food computation models, primarily involving the analysis of nutrition and ingredients, to also incorporate cooking actions (e.g., add salt, fry the meat, boil the vegetables, etc.), Cooking actions are notoriously hard to model using statistical learning methods due to irregular data patterns - significantly varying natural language descriptions for the same action (e.g., marinate the meat vs. marinate the meat and leave overnight) and infrequently occurring patterns (e.g., add salt occurs far more frequently than marinating the meat). The prototypical approach to handling irregular data patterns is to increase the volume of data that the model ingests by orders of magnitude. Unfortunately, in the cooking domain, these problems are further compounded with larger data volumes presenting a unique challenge that is not easily handled by simply scaling up. In this work, we propose novel aggregation-based generative AI methods, Cook-Gen, that reliably generate cooking actions from recipes, despite difficulties with irregular data patterns, while also outperforming Large Language Models and other strong baselines.},

While these models have unlocked new possibilities, they simultaneously present significant challenges, such as concerns over data privacy and the propensity to generate misleading or fabricated content. Current frameworks for Responsible AI (RAI) often fall short in providing the granular guidance necessary for tangible application, especially for Accountabilityâ€”a principle that is pivotal for ensuring transparent and auditable decision-making, bolstering public trust, and meeting increasing regulatory expectations. This study bridges the Accountability gap by introducing our effort towards a comprehensive metrics catalogue, formulated through a systematic multivocal literature review (MLR) that integrates findings from both academic and grey literature. Our catalogue delineates process metrics that underpin procedural integrity, resource metrics that provide necessary tools and frameworks, and product metrics that reflect the outputs of AI systems.

The proposed lifelong dual generative adversarial networks (LD-GANs) consist of two generative adversarial networks (GANs), namely, a Teacher and an Assistant teaching each other in tandem while successively learning a series of tasks. A single discriminator is used to decide the realism of generated images by the dual GANs. A new training algorithm, called the lifelong self knowledge distillation (LSKD) is proposed for training the LD-GAN while learning each new task during lifelong learning (LLL). LSKD enables the transfer of knowledge from one more knowledgeable player to the other jointly with learning the information from a newly given dataset, within an adversarial playing game setting. In contrast to other LLL models, LD-GANs are memory efficient and does not require freezing any parameters after learning each given task. Furthermore, we extend the LD-GANs to being the Teacher module in a Teacherâ€“Student network for assimilating data representations across several domains during LLL. Experimental results indicate a better performance for the proposed framework in unsupervised lifelong representation learning when compared to other methods.},

  abstract={As a significant composition of art, fine art painting is becoming a research hotspot in machine learning community. With unique aesthetic value, paintings have quite different representations from natural images, making them irreplaceable. Meanwhile, the lack of training data is common in painting-related machine learning tasks. Therefore, the synthesis of fine art painting is meaningful and challenging work. There are two main types of generative models for image synthesis: generative adversarial networks (GANs) and likelihood-based models. GAN-based models can obtain high-quality samples but usually sacrifice diversity and training stability. Diffusion models are a class of likelihood-based models and have recently been shown to achieve state-of-the-art quality on the image synthesis tasks. In this paper, we explore generating fine art paintings by using diffusion models. We carried out the experiments on the partial impression paintings from the Wikiart dataset. The results demonstrate that the diffusion model can generate high-quality samples, and it is easy to train to cover more target distribution than the GAN-based methods.},

  abstract={Panoramic video has the characteristics of high resolution, massive information and high sense of immersion, bringing unprecedented visual sensory enjoyment to us. However, considering the limited capacity of current cellular network, videos transmitted to users are often encoded, e.g. by High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), resulting in block artifact problems that significantly affects the visual quality. Thus, it is necessary to enhance the quality of compressed panoramic videos. Inspired by the convolutional networks (CNN) and generative adversarial networks (GAN), the paper proposes a deep GAN model -Artifacts Reduction GAN (ARGAN) which is able to enhance the quality of compressed panoramic videos. ARGAN has the ability of reducing artifacts caused by HEVC. Meanwhile, it can increase the visual realistic of the enhanced videos. We tested the performance of our model under PSNR, SSIM and Perception Index. Qualitative results are also provided to display the visual effects of ARGAN. Experimental results show that our method is superior to other quality enhancement methods in both qualitative and quantitative aspects.},

  abstract={Low-resolution (LR) videos are common in various applications, including surveillance and video conferencing, primarily due to bandwidth constraints or older recording technologies. This research introduces a novel approach for enhancing the quality of LR videos by leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) equipped with MeanShift loss, perceptual loss, Total Variation (TV) Loss, and a modified VGG19 architecture. By processing each frame of an LR video through our model, we achieve significant improvements in visual quality, detail sharpness, and temporal consistency, resulting in high-resolution (HR) videos that are both visually pleasing and realistic. The conventional approach to video enhancement, particularly when employing deep learning models like GANs, involves processing high volumes of data, which can be computationally intensive and time-consuming. This challenge is compounded in real-time applications or environments lacking powerful graphical processing units (GPUs). Our research proposes a novel solution by extracting frames from low-resolution (LR) videos, enhancing each frame individually, and then recombining them into a high-resolution (HR) video. This method offers a significant reduction in computational requirements, making high-quality video enhancement accessible on less capable hardware and suitable for real-time processing.},

  abstract={The increasing demand for multimedia content in education, media, and information dissemination has created a need for efficient and accessible video production tools. This research presents VisoGen, an AI-driven system designed to automate the video content creation process. A system based on artificial intelligence produces informative videos from one input: a topic name. Upon receiving the topic, the system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to automatically retrieve and summarize key information. This generated text is then converted into speech using Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology. Simultaneously, a visual representation of the text is created in the form of subtitles, which are synchronized with the audio for enhanced accessibility. The system then compiles the audio and visual components into a coherent video output. By automating research, content generation, voiceover, and video editing, the proposed system streamlines content creation, making it an efficient and valuable tool for educational, informational, and media production applications. The system significantly reduces the time and effort typically required for manual video creation, offering a seamless solution for users to generate high-quality, multimodal content tailored to their needs. This approach can be particularly beneficial in various sectors such as online learning, media, marketing, and content creation, enhancing both productivity and accessibility.},

  abstract={Lumbar spinal stenosis is a narrowing or constriction in the lumbar spine. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is preferred for its diagnosis. Limited research has been conducted with the intent of making synthetic and pseudo in-painting datasets. The objective of this study was to develop a model to create a slice of MR image in the subsequent spinal disc, given an MR image slice from previous disc. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the effectiveness of creating pseudo in-painting in the datasets for Lumbar Spine Stenosis. We selected a publicly available dataset, named Lumbar Spine MR images Dataset, for reproducibility. We used 1,545 composite T1 and T2 MR images (combined) in the axial view. The combined images were of 515 patients, each having the lower three levels (L3 to L5) of the lumbar spine. Broadly, our method is Generative Adversarial Network that we modified for our task. Our accuracy metric was the DICE Score. The accuracy was between 88.66 and 90.85%. We claim that our work is significant, as it establishes the ability of GAN to perform in-painting based on a slice for a disc, which indicates possibilities of future research on in-painting of larger stack of MR images and expansive synthetic dataset generation.},

  abstract={Few developments seem as poised to alter the characteristics of security in the digital age as the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. For national defense establishments, the emergence of AI techniques is particularly worrisome, not least because prototype applications already exist. Cyber attacks augmented by AI portend the tailored manipulation of human vectors within the attack surface of important societal systems at great scale, as well as opportunities for calamity resulting from the secondment of technical skill from the hacker to the algorithm. Arguably most important, however, is the fact that AI-enabled cyber campaigns contain great potential for operational obfuscation and strategic misdirection. At the operational level, techniques for piggybacking onto routine activities and for adaptive evasion of security protocols add uncertainty, complicating the defensive mission particularly where adversarial learning tools are employed in offense. Strategically, AI-enabled cyber operations offer distinct attempts to persistently shape the spectrum of cyber contention may be able to pursue conflict outcomes beyond the expected scope of adversary operation. On the other, AI-augmented cyber defenses incorporated into national defense postures are likely to be vulnerable to "poisoning" attacks that predict, manipulate and subvert the functionality of defensive algorithms. This article takes on two primary tasks. First, it considers and categorizes the primary ways in which AI technologies are likely to augment offensive cyber operations, including the shape of cyber activities designed to target AI systems. Then, it frames a discussion of implications for deterrence in cyberspace by referring to the policy of persistent engagement, agreed competition and forward defense promulgated in 2018 by the United States. Here, it is argued that the centrality of cyberspace to the deployment and operation of soon-to-be-ubiquitous AI systems implies new motivations for operation within the domain, complicating numerous assumptions that underlie current approaches. In particular, AI cyber operations pose unique measurement issues for the policy regime.},

  abstract={Adversarial training is commonly used in the artificial intelligence literature to improve the robustness of deep neural models to adversarial samples. In addition, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been recently investigated to improve the interpretability and explainability of black-box artificial systems such as deep neural models. In this study, we propose a methodology that combines adversarial training and XAI, in order to increase the accuracy of deep neural models trained for cyber-threat detection. In particular, we use the FGSM technique to generate the adversarial samples for the adversarial training stage, and SHAP to produce the local explanations of decisions made during the adversarial training stage. These local explanations are, subsequently, used to produce a new feature set that describes the effect of the original cyber-data characteristics on the classifications of the examples processed during the adversarial training stage. Leveraging this XAI-based information, we apply a transfer learning strategy, namely fine-tuning, to improve the accuracy performance of the deep neural model. Experiments conducted on two benchmark cybersecurity datasets prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in the multi-class classification of cyber-data.},

  pages={4539-4552},
  abstract={Mode collapse has been a persisting challenge in generative adversarial networks (GANs), and it directly affects the applications of GAN in many domains. Existing works that attempt to solve this problem have some serious limitations: models using optimal transport (OT) strategies (e.g., Wasserstein distance) lead to vanishing or exploding gradients; increasing the number of generators can cause several generators focusing on the same mode; and approaches that modify the loss also do not satisfactorily resolve mode collapse. In this article, we reduce mode collapse by formulating it as a Monge problem of OT map. We show that the Monge problem can be transformed to the distribution transformation problem in GAN, and a rectified affine neural network can be considered as a measurable function. In this way, we propose Monge GAN that uses this measurable function to transform the generated data distribution into the original data distribution. We utilize the Kantorovich formulation to obtain the OT cost, which is regarded as the OT distance between the two distributions. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both image and numerical datasets to validate our Monge GAN in reducing model collapse.},

  pages={1041-1052},
  abstract={Deep neural network (DNN) greatly improves the efficiency of modulation recognition in wireless communication, but it also suffers from attacks. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) possesses powerful data generation capabilities, which can be used to defend against attacks in modulation recognition. In practical scenarios, closed box attack can be implemented without information on the model. This is a great security threat. The existing defense methods are difficult to improve the robustness of the model while ensuring the recognition accuracy of the original signals. Therefore, this paper uses GAI to propose an adversarial decoupled defense method to protect modulation recognition. Firstly, for weak adversarial perturbations, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is used to highlight the high-frequency features in the signal, and the adversary detector is designed to detect the suspiciousness. Then, the signal is regenerated based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) to weaken the antagonism in the example. Further, the traditional adversarial training is decoupled into an original branch and an adversarial branch, and the outputs of the two branches are fused according to the suspiciousness. Simulation results show that the proposed defense method has high recognition accuracy for both original examples and adversarial examples even under attacks, and can effectively improve the robustness of the intelligent recognition model.},

In this framework, several representative GAN models, including PE-GAN, XOR-GAN, and TriNet-GAN, are designed to enhance the performance of deep learning models in network threat detection. Large-scale adversarial generation experiments are conducted on the original imbalanced dataset and security event logs using AC-GAN and Seq-GAN, effectively solving the imbalance and few-shot issues. The experimental results are based on the publicly available NIMS (Network Information Management and Security Group) and KDD99 datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in data augmentation for few-shot, imbalanced, and multidimensional complex data.},

  abstract={For employees, generative AI chatbots can encourage productivity and optimize work processes with the specific insights provided. The problem is the ethical implications for the privacy and confidentiality of company data that employees carelessly enter into a generative AI chatbot platform.

This research uses quantitative methods like the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) statistical method. Purposive sampling determines the number of samples, with data collection from February to April 2024. Based on the data collection results, 402 employees in Indonesia who used generative AI chatbots became valid respondents who answered the online questionnaire using Google Forms. The research results show a significant picture of the factors influencing awareness of data governance behavior and company data usage behavior in generative AI chatbots. The test used nine hypotheses, where the results found that six hypotheses had a significant effect and three hypotheses were not significant.

  abstract={Cloud and snow detection in remote sensing images has advanced significantly with the aid of deep learning methods. However, deep learning methods necessitate a large quantity of labeled data, which consumes a substantial amount of human and material resources. Numerous studies have focused on weakly supervised methods to reduce the workload of annotation, but the majority of these methods concentrate on cloud detection and involve snow detection only infrequently. In this article, we propose a novel weakly supervised cloud and snow detection method. Under the guidance of the remote sensing imaging mechanism, we design generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate cloud and snow images and pseudolabels for training detection networks. The proposed method can generate clouds of different states and reproduce snow's texture. For both the cloud GAN model and snow GAN model, with only image-level annotation training supervision, the models produce both pixel-level cloud/snow reflectance and cloud opacity to obtain the generated remote sensing images and corresponding pseudolabels. Compared to other weakly supervised methods, our method achieves superior cloud and snow detection performance.},

  pages={214-220},
  abstract={In the one-bit massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel scenario, the accurate channel estimation becomes more difficult because the signals received by the low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADC) are quantized and affected by channel noise. Therefore, a one-bit massive MIMO channel estimation method is proposed in this paper. The channel matrix is regarded as a two-dimensional image. In order to enhance the significance of noise features in the image and remove them, the channel attention mechanism is introduced into the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to generate channel images, and improve the loss function. The simulation results show that the improved network can use a smaller number of pilots to obtain better channel estimation results. Under the same number of pilots and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the channel estimation accuracy can be improved by about 7.5 dB, and can adapt to the scenarios with more antennas.},

  abstract={Convolutional generative models have achieved significant success in the field of artificial intelligence in recent years. These models typically rely on numerous convolution and transposed convolution operators, both of which are highly computationally intensive but present distinct computation patterns. As a result, accelerating the convolutional generative models can be challenging, particularly when the transposed convolution is likely to become performance bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a dataflow for overcoming the challenge and effectively accelerating both computation-hungry operators of convolutional generative models in the unified architecture. Additionally, we have devised specific tiling schemes to flexibly map both convolution and transposed convolution and fully reuse hardware resources. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we implemented DCGAN and ST on the Xilinx ZCU102 platform. Our experiments show that the proposed dataflow can reduce memory cost by up to 36%, achieving comparable performance for both convolution and transposed convolution.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={This article examines in depth the effects of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) models in the field of natural language processing (NLP). NLP, as a sub-branch of computer science and artificial intelligence, has an important place in the processes of understanding, processing and producing human language. Transformer-based models have provided revolutionary advances in many NLP tasks, especially language modeling, sentiment analysis, machine translation and question answering. In this article, the technical structures of BERT and GPT models, their performance in low-resource languages such as Turkish and the difficulties encountered in these languages are discussed in detail. The BERT model stands out with its ability to evaluate the contextual meaning of the language from both directions using bidirectional context and offers high success rates especially in tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition (NER) and sentiment analysis. The GPT model, on the other hand, provides superiority in text production with its autoregressive structure and gives successful results in tasks such as creative writing and chatbots. However, the application of these models to morphologically rich and agglutinative languages such as Turkish poses certain challenges. These challenges arise due to the structural features of the language and the limitations of the datasets. The article also discusses the development of Turkish-specific models such as BERTurk, data augmentation techniques, and the success of modifications appropriate to the characteristics of the language in overcoming these challenges. In conclusion, the development of BERT and GPT models in the field of NLP has been a major step in terms of natural language processing and modeling. However, further research and development is required for these models to perform better in languages such as Turkish. The article predicts that future developments of these models will enable language technologies to reach wider audiences and be used in various applications.},

  abstract={Multivariate statistical process control (MSPC) is a technique for detecting anomalies by monitoring several quality characteristics simultaneously. For the MSPC problem, the Hotellingâ€™s  $T^{2}$  control chart has been widely used as a typical method. Recently, researchers have converted the MSPC problem into a classification problem such as the artificial contrast (AC) and the one-class classification (OCC). Previous studies have shown that these methods outperform the Hotellingâ€™s  $T^{2}$  chart when the data do not follow a multivariate normal distribution. However, unless the size of the process data is enough for the AC and the OCC, they cannot work properly. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection (AD) approach. The proposed method adopts the least square generative adversarial network (LS-GAN) to estimate the probability distribution of the training data. It generates new training samples from the learned probability distribution. The classifiers such as the random forests (RF) and the one-class support vector machines (OC-SVM) are considered for tackling the AC and the OCC respectively. The numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC).},

  abstract={Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication supports numerous tasks, from driving safety to entertainment services. To achieve a holistic view, vehicles are typically equipped with multiple sensors. However, processing large volumes of multimodal data increases transmission load, while the dynamic nature of vehicular networks adds to transmission instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, generative artificial intelligence (GAI)-enhanced multimodal semantic communication (SemCom), referred to as G-MSC, designed to handle various vehicular network tasks by employing suitable analog or digital transmission. GAI presents a promising opportunity to transform the SemCom framework by significantly enhancing semantic encoding, semantic information transmission, and semantic decoding. It optimizes multimodal information fusion at the transmitter, enhances channel robustness during transmission, and mitigates noise interference at the receiver. To validate the effectiveness of the G-MSC framework, we conduct a case study showcasing its performance in vehicular communication networks for predictive tasks. The experimental results show that the design achieves reliable and efficient communication in V2X networks. In the end, we present future research directions of G-MSC.},

The emergence of artificial intelligence has significantly impacted the media and entertainment sectors, overcoming the constraints associated with conventional colorization techniques, which typically depend on manual processes and rudimentary algorithms. This investigation highlights several critical challenges, such as the effective training of deep neural networks, optimization for color accuracy, and compliance with performance benchmarks. The proposed framework utilizes a multi-phase training approach to enhance resilience, a tailored loss function to improve color precision, and attention mechanisms to effectively capture intricate textures, supported by comprehensive evaluations against established benchmark datasets.

  abstract={We propose novel structures of generator and discriminator in physics-informed generative adversarial networks called multiple-generator-and-discriminator generative adversarial networks (MGDGANs), that are designed to solve stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). MGDGANs for SPDEs consist of three steps: a generator that samples a solution to the SPDEs, a physics-informed operator that enforces the governing equation, and a discriminator that distinguishes between samples from the generator and training samples. Inspired by the polynomial chaos, we represent the solution by the inner product of functions in spatial and random variables, and model each function by a separate generator. We show that the proposed multiple generator structure offers huge computational savings in training and prediction. If multiple stochastic processes exist in the system, then a distinct discriminator is used for each of them. We show that the loss function obtained by these distinct discriminators provides an equivalent metric to the Wasserstein distance loss by a single discriminator, and provide numerical examples to demonstrate that these multiple discriminators enhance the training accuracy. Numerical examples are demonstrated to verify that the proposed model is efficient in computation and memory; the model reduces computing time by more than a factor of 10 and relative l2 error by about one-third in the SPDE example.},

  year={2020},
  volume={8},
  number={},
  pages={70111-70124},
  abstract={For the fault diagnosis problems of rotating machinery in the real industrial practice, measurement data with imbalanced class distributions negatively affect the diagnostic performance of most conventional machine learning classification algorithms since equal cost weights are assigned to different fault classes. Meanwhile, the widely used traditional data generation methods for the imbalanced data problem are limited by data dependencies over time continuity. To fill this research gap, this paper develops a new diagnostic framework based on the adversarial neural networks (GAN) and multi-sensor data fusion technique to generate new synthetic data for data compensation purpose. Two different practice modes are designed based on this framework according to the position logic of the data fusion, namely a Pre-fusion GAN mode and a Post-fusion GAN mode. More concretely, without data pre-processing, the designed generator generates synthetic data to puzzle the discriminator and the synthetic data that out-trick the discriminator can be used to compensate the minor class. To avoid data dependency and to ensure the generality of the proposed framework, the network modelling are trained with a more practical approach where the training and test data are obtained under different rotating speeds. Two imbalanced data sets on the rotating machinery, one benchmark public rolling bearing data set and another gear box data set acquired in our lab, are used to validate the proposed method. The performance is examined through a wide range of data imbalanced ratios (as high as 30:1), and compared with other state-of-the-art methods. The experiment results conclude that the proposed Pre-fusion GAN and Post-fusion GAN frameworks both have good performance on the imbalanced fault diagnosis of rotating machinery.},

  abstract={With the popularization of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC), the explosion of end users is spurring an unprecedented diversity in preferences. To cope with this challenge, the AIGC paradigm is shifting from cloud-driven pre-trained large models to edge-driven personalized customization models. The former are large-scale models with more than 100 billion parameters trained based on massive data, while the latter introduce heterogeneous user preferences or professional knowledge to fine-tune the former. However, such fine-tuning incurs costly resource consumption and privacy disclosure. In this paper, we offer a holistic perspective on the AIGC fine-tuning framework spanning from end user to edge to cloud. Specifically, we first investigate how to deploy an edge-driven collaborative fine-tuning task through federated learning. Then, we discuss a verifiable model consensus protocol and fairness incentive design for edge servers to participate in a collaborative learning task. In addition, a case study focuses on the medical scenario, where we develop a practical X-ray diagnostic demo through collaborative fine-tuning of a multimodal pre-training model, and the diagnostic dialogue and performance results are compared. Finally, potential research directions are identified to advance the edge-driven customized AIGC services.},

  abstract={Image colorization is of great use for several applications, such as the restoration of old images, as well as enabling the storage of grayscale images, which take up less space, which can later be colorized. But this problem is hard since there exist many possible color combinations for a particular grayscale image. Recent developments have aimed to solve this problem using deep learning. But, for achieving good performance, they require highly processed inputs, along with additional elements, such as semantic maps. In this paper, an attempt has been made for generalizing the procedure of colorization using a conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) by adding "Perceptual Loss". The network is trained over the CIFAR-100 dataset. The results of the proposed generative model with perceptual loss are compared with the existing state-of-the-art systems normal GAN model and U-Net Convolutional model.},

The complexity of using datasets to forecast livestock diseases enabling intervention and surveillance is overstated. This work provides a data synthesis method that has been applied to produce fresh data samples with accuracy from limited real-world data, in order to meet this difficulty. The ML models are trained on a large amount of data, which eliminates overfitting. We propose the synthesis of categorical data for training machine learning models for the prediction of Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) disease using Generative Adversarial Networks, namely the Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network. The training score increased to 0.89 and the cross-validation score to 0.87 when the Random Forest algorithm was applied to the synthesized data, according to the results. The Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) disease can be predicted and monitored with the help of the generated dataset. With more data available, the suggested approach can be used in any area with categorical data for data-driven models and may enhance the performance of machine learning models.},

  abstract={Future sixth-generation (6G) networks are envisioned to support intelligent applications across various vertical scenarios which have stringent requirements on high-precision sensing as well as ultra-low-latency data processing and decision making. Toward this end, a new paradigm of edge perception network emerges. This network integrates wireless sensing, communication, computation, and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities at network edge for intelligent sensing and data processing. This article provides a timely overview on this emerging topic. We commence by discussing wireless edge perception, including physical layer transceiver design, network-wise cooperation, and application-specific data analytics, for which the prospects and challenges are emphasized. Next, we discuss the interplay between edge AI and wireless sensing in edge perception, and present various key techniques for two paradigms, namely edge AI empowered sensing and task-oriented sensing for edge AI, respectively. Finally, we emphasize interesting research directions on edge perception to motivate future works.},

  abstract={Automatic Modulation Recognition(AMR) is crucial in cognitive radio, transitioning from traditional methods to deep learning-based classification. However, deep learning requires large datasets for effective training, making data augmentation vital for enhancing model generalization and accuracy. It helps to expand the dataset, thereby improving the modelsâ€™ generalization ability and accuracy. We proposes a novel data augmentation approach for AMR task based on signal mixing, with four specific methods designed to improve the performance of Mixed Signals. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods lead to a notable improvement in the classification accuracy of deep learning-based AMR models in diverse scenarios. Notably, experiments conducted with datasets at a single signal-to-noise ratio show a significant increase in classification accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of the signal mixing method.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},

  pages={210-215},
  abstract={A key aspect of artificial intelligence is continual learning. The capacity of a model to incrementally learn from a new task and adapt to it without losing the previous knowledge. A fundamental challenge that comes to successful continual learning is catastrophic forgetting; while learning a new task the model forgets the previously learned tasks. Various approaches to mitigate forgetting and enhance continual learning have been discussed across benchmark datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR- 10, and Permuted MNIST. we focus mainly on replay, regularization, and modular architecture-based methods to prevent forgetting. Regularization methods penalize the significant change in parameters during the learning of new tasks while maintaining crucial parameters of previously completed tasks. Replay-based methods store samples of earlier tasks in explicit memory or generate pseudo-samples with the help of generative models. Modular architecture-based methods partition the neural architecture into task-specific modules to prevent interference between tasks, to effectively address catastrophic forgetting. This paper presents a comparative study of the key continual learning methods that reduce catastrophic forgetting. The findings demonstrate the trade-offs between different methods. We examine the efficiency and effectiveness of each method and propose a hybrid technique to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Our comparative analysis emphasizes the significance of choosing the best method depending on the specific requirement of the learning environment, the task complexity, and resource constraints.},

We propose several scenarios, in which CNN trained with synthetically generated histopathology images perform on par with or even better than the same baseline model trained with real images.

The evolutionary search is based on exploring the real-coded latent space of StyleGAN2. The main results over both synthetic and real images indicate that the proposed approach generates accurate and diverse solutions, which represent realistic human portraits.

  abstract={Deep learning has shown great strength in regions of interest (ROIs) detection for remote sensing images (RSIs). However, for most of RSIs, the unbalanced distribution of positive and negative samples greatly limits the performance of the deep learning-based methods. To cope with this issue, we propose a novel method based on texture guided variational autoencoder-attention wise generative adversarial network (VAE-AGAN) to augment the training data for ROI detection. First, to generate realistic texture details of RSIs, we propose a texture guidance block to embed texture prior information into encoder and decoder networks. Second, we introduce the channel and spatial-wise attention layers in the discriminator construct to adaptively recalibrate the varying importance of different channels and spatial regions of input RSIs. Finally, we apply the RSI dataset balanced by our proposal to the weakly supervised ROI detection method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposal can not only improve the performance of ROI detection, but also outperform other competing augmentation methods.},

  pages={99-104},
  abstract={The literature has shown that facial recognition technology has been widely employed in diverse industries, such as consumer and security applications. It played a crucial role in enhancing consumer security measures, facilitating biometric identification processes, and elevating consumer experiences. However, the deployment of this technology also leads to significant privacy and ethical considerations that necessitate meticulous attention and regulation in operations. In recent years, You Only Look Once (YOLO) has also shown promising results as an image classifier. However, an in-depth analysis is required to explore the effectiveness of YOLOv8 in the classification of real and fake facial images. Hence, this research is to build an image classification framework employing the YOLOv8 architecture with the aim of efficiently differentiating between real and fake or synthetic (artificially generated) facial images. The methodology involves training the YOLOv8 model using a publicly accessible dataset containing both real and fake faces generated using generative artificial intelligence (AI). The dataset has been obtained from the Kaggle database, consisting of 140k real and fake images employing AI. The extensive series of experimental findings validates the efficacy of the model, with a notable training and testing accuracy of 99.35% and 98.2%, respectively. These significant results are obtained with training over 20 epochs with a minimal error rate of 0.0065. The aforementioned results are the best among standalone deep learning models trained using transfer learning, highlighting the practical efficiency and resilience of the proposed framework for discerning authentic and AI generated facial images, hence demonstrating its potential for use in diverse practical contexts.},

Researching on fault diagnosis related technology for electric power transformers to accurately identify fault types and characteristics holds immense importance for transformer maintenance and the development of appropriate maintenance strategies. However, in real practice, the lack of oil chromatographic data and the imbalanced percentage of fault case data currently impede the development of the electric power transformer health monitoring. In order to solve the problems, we introduce a generation method using GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) model combining causal mechanism as conditions.
