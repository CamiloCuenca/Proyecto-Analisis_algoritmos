  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in general, and large language models (LLMs) in particular, are highly fashionable. As they have the ability to generate coherent output based on prompts in natural language, they are promoted as tools to free knowledge workers from tedious tasks such as content writing, customer support and routine computer code generation. Unsurprisingly, their application is also attractive to professionals in the research domain, where mundane and laborious tasks, such as literature screening, are commonplace. We evaluate Vertex AI ‘text-bison’, a foundational LLM model, in a real-world academic scenario by replicating parts of a popular systematic review in the information management domain. By comparing the results of a zero-shot LLM-based approach with those of the original study, we gather evidence on the suitability of state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs for the analysis of scientific content. We show that the LLM-based approach delivers good scientific content analysis performance for a general classification problem (ACC =0.9), acceptable performance for a domain-specific classification problem (ACC =0.8) and borderline performance for a text comprehension problem (ACC ≈0.69). We conclude that some content analysis tasks with moderate accuracy requirements may be supported by current LLMs. As the technology will evolve rapidly in the foreseeable future, studies on large corpora, where some inaccuracies are tolerable, or workflows that prepare large data sets for human processing, may increasingly benefit from the capabilities of GenAI.},

  abstract={The study aims to improve brainstorming by utilizing Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) to generate more ideas and increase novelty. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine the rules and techniques of brainstorming. An experiment was conducted in which Gen AI was added to improve the brainstorming process. The results showed a significant positive correlation between participants' confidence in the information provided by Gen AI and an increase in the number of non-redundant ideas generated by co-ideation. In addition, participants' expectations of co-ideation with Gen AI were significantly positively correlated with an increase in both non-redundant and unique ideas. Gen AI can be an extension of human thinking in brainstorming, leading to improved idea generation. However, the effectiveness of Gen AI depends on the user's attitude towards AI.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={326-331},
  abstract={This study addresses the limitations of traditional prescribed meal plans, which lack personalization and often prove monotonous and challenging for patients to follow. We propose a novel approach employing generative artificial intelligence in the context of a learning health system, with an emphasis on inpatient clinical dietetics. The system incorporates two key models: the Meal Plan Generation Model, MeaIGM, and the Meal Plan Image Generation Model, MealImageGM, leveraging state-of-the-art large language models. Patient information from electronic health records and clinical dietetics guidelines are incorporated into prompts for MeaIGM, which is refined through nutritionist validations and users' feedback. On the other hand, MealImageGM generates visual representations of meal plans to enhance patient engagement, utilizing crowd-sourced feedback to optimize image generation prompts. The overall system process includes extracting data from electronic health records, pre-designed user meal generation prompts, and the generation of personalized meal plans and images. Nutritionists play a crucial role in monitoring patient adherence and preferences, contributing to a continuous learning health system cycle. The proposed framework ensures clinically appropriate and personalized meal plans, aligning with dynamic dietary recommendations. The study emphasizes the importance of patient-physician co-creation for constant optimization and highlights the potential positive impact on health outcomes.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), including large language and image models, have created new opportunities for pervasive computing education. How do we integrate emerging AI models and tools into our courses in a way that fosters critical engagement? How do we teach students to use AI models and tools responsibly, thoughtfully, and ethically, while being aware of their capabilities and limitations? In this article, we share insights from integrating generative AI tools and machine learning (ML) models into a project-based undergraduate tangible and embodied interaction (TEI) course by employing co-creation processes. TEI is an evolving area within human–computer interaction, which focuses on integrating computation into our daily physical environments and objects, thus fostering an embodied, multisensory, and often collaborative interaction experience. We use the term co-creation to describe a process, where humans and AI work together to create new artifacts or solve a problem. We integrated structured co-creation activities into various phases of the project including ideation, conceptual design, and prototyping. We describe practical ways and learning goals for integrating emerging generative AI tools and ML models into the project design process, provide insight on how novice interaction designers iterate and collaborate with generative AI and ML models, and reflect on the merits and limitations of using generative AI tools and ML models for project-based interaction design courses for pervasive computing.},

  abstract={Summary <p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is concerned with creating new data&#x2014;such as text, pictures, videos&#x2014;based on preexisting data. It involves devices and algorithms that learn from the massive volume of data they are provided, enabling them to continuously get better. Generative AI was initially made popular by ChatGPT, an AI chatbot. Apple plans to introduce an AI&#x2010;powered coding assistant in Xcode, thereby entering the AI&#x2010;assisted coding space and taking aim at Microsoft's GitHub Copilot. AI presents itself as a game&#x2010;changer for optimizing supply chain processes and to boost productivity. Specifically, AI can assist the supply chain challenges for business by doing the following: predictive analytics, optimization, automation, and real&#x2010;time visibility. This chapter explores some practical applications of AI in supply chain management for achieving business scalability: demand forecasting, inventory optimization, supplier management, and warehouse automation.</p>},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (AI), specifically Large Language Models (LLMS) such as generative pretrained transformers (GPTS) have emerged as a transformational technology in modern research and applications. This technology will revolutionize a wide variety of fields, including remote sensing and Earth observation. We explore the use of LLMS to improve and automate EO analysis, making these results more accessible to a broad range of decision makers. We develop a framework using this technology to support the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) and NASA’s Open Science initiative. This framework leverages current work on Earth observation tools, including the Open Data Cube (ODC) [1] and the OEA Algorithm Hub (AlgoHub). [2]In our work, we investigate the ability of large language models to orchestrate and reason with tools created to access geospatial data using the Open Data Cube and the OEA Algorithm Hub [2]. In this paper we propose a natural language analytical framework for orchestrating Earth observation (EO) analysis. The framework uses large language models to interpret an analysis request, devise a solution based on ODC and AlgoHub tools, and execute the analysis. Our experimental investigations demonstrate that an LLM, with its embedded contextual knowledge, can effectively discern and sequence the necessary processing steps required to fulfill Earth observation analysis requests. This research demonstrates the potential of Generative AI (LLMs) in streamlining and enhancing EO analyses and empowering the observation community.In summary, Generative AI (LLMs) can enhance the capabilities of Earth observation analysis by automating tasks, providing natural language interfaces, and facilitating the extraction of valuable insights from the vast and complex datasets generated by remote sensing and EO technologies.},

Educators are now faced with the task of adopting genAI into curricula in ways that are responsive to both the short- and long-term effects of this technological disruption on learning. This study considers these effects, focusing on the impacts of genAI on the intrinsic value of learning and its influences on shaping transformative encounters with knowledge in STEM curricula. The implications of incorporating genAI into outcomes and assessment tasks are examined using a constructivist approach based on taxonomies of cognitive skills involved in learning and STEM competency development namely, Bloom's and SOLO taxonomies, and Luckett's knowledge planes. The study offers insights into how the incorporation of genAI may influence conceptual knowledge building and the development of certain STEM graduate attributes and makes recommendations for teachers of STEM curricula.},

  abstract={This article examines the application of generative artificial intelligence in simulating virtual tourism experiences and its impact on tourist behavior in the postCOVID era. Utilizing advanced technologies such as Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, and WebXR, a system has been designed to create interactive virtual experiences of tourist destinations. A literature review reveals that both virtual experiences and generative AI hold significant potential in the tourism industry. However, few studies have explored how these two technologies can be combined and their impact on tourist behavior. Additionally, considering that generative AI, as a tool for simulating tourism experiences, significantly influences tourists' perception of destinations and attractions, travel intention, travel anxiety, and willingness to pay, studying generative AI and virtual tourism seems essential and important. Therefore, this study aims to review previous research and explore the impact of AI-based virtual tourism experiences on tourist behavior in the post-COVID era. Moreover, the study investigates factors influencing the effectiveness of these experiences and the moderating role of safety and health concerns. Results also show that perceived realism and interactivity of virtual experiences are key factors in the effectiveness of these experiences. This research provides a theoretical framework for understanding the influence of generative AI on tourism behavior and offers important practical implications for destination marketers and policymakers in the post-COVID tourism industry.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) refers to the use of neural networks to produce new output data, which could be in the form of text, image, audio, video, or other modalities. During training, these models learn the underlying distributions of the data such that, during inference, they can generate new output data in response to an input prompt (typically a text prompt). In recent years, we have witnessed a staggeringly rapid progression in capability and sophistication of these generative models, following a major boom in investment in AI research during the 2020s. This article provides a brief tutorial on GenAI for edge devices, as a summary of the tutorial of the same name given at the International Solid State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) this year.},

  abstract={The advancements in diffusion model enables the creation of highly detailed images. However, concurrently fusing texts and images poses significant challenges, often struggling with the maintenance of text accuracy across languages, optimal placement, and appropriate typography. To address these challenges, we introduce the Multilingual Accurate Textual Image Customization (MATIC) framework. MATIC employs the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) concept to decompose the textual image generation process into multiple steps, leveraging diverse generative artificial intelligence, including Multimodal Large Language Model (MMLLM) and diffusion model. The framework first generates the desired text and a corresponding prompt for the diffusion model based on user input. The diffusiongenerated image is then examined to remove any undesired text. Meanwhile, the typographic elements are designed to align with the visual content. Finally, the textual image is fused with the aid of a grid coordinate system, evaluated by MMLLM, and further customized by the user through natural language. Experimental results demonstrate that MATIC can produce accurate, high-quality, multilingual textual images that meet user requirements across various domains, including digital marketing, graphic design, and educational content creation.},

  abstract={Summary <p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI) could turn brainstorming sessions into a wild ride of endless ideas, design personalized virtual experiences, and maybe even help us write that novel we've been dreaming about. So far, GenAI enables us to automate and augment cognitive and creative jobs, including the work of doctors, designers, musicians, marketers, and more. Physical jobs such as building, assembly line work, cleaning, and so on are (by and large) unaffected by the wave of GenAI transformation. But combine GenAI with robots and that may change. GenAI can help us tackle some of the biggest problems on the planet. Yes, GenAI can be used to draft a funny speech for our friend's wedding, or come up with an idea for tonight's supper. But it can also be used to address issues like climate change, massive inequality, hunger, access to healthcare, and more. It can help us find new treatments for diseases.</p>},
