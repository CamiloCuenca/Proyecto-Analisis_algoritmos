  abstract={This review examines the utilization of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in classroom instructions, emphasizing its transformative potential in education. After reviewing 23 relevant articles, we identified three themes: application advantages, possible risks, and future paths. Specifically, GAI has the potential to facilitate personalized learning, promote communication, and promoting education equity. However, concerns over content validity, ethical issues, and the risk of diminished innovation necessitate careful consideration. Additionally, prior literature suggests improving instructional evaluation methods, enhancing AI literacy, and addressing ethical challenges to maximize GAI's benefits and drive continuous educational innovation.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={902-906},
  abstract={Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an agile software development approach. It promotes short cycles, composed of three phases each, to incrementally implement software functionality: Red, Green, and Refactor. In the Red Phase, the TDD developer writes a unit test for a small chunk of functionality not yet implemented and watches the test fail. In the Green Phase, the TDD developer writes production code to make the test pass as quickly as possible. Finally, in the refactor phase, the TDD developer “cleans” written code. In this demo paper, we present GAI4-TDD (Generative Artificial Intelligence for Test-Driven Development), a PyCharm plugin to support the Green Phase of TDD. Specifically, this plugin generates production code from the tests the TDD developer had written in the Red Phase so that the generated code makes these tests pass. Previous studies have shown that TDD can be beneficial not only in the “traditional” software development context but also in the Embedded Systems (ESs) development context. We preliminary assessed GAI4-TDD in the latter context through a laboratory empirical study on three ESs. We observed that in the greater part of the cases, GAI4- TDD generates production code that successfully implements the chunk of functionality required. A video showing GAI4- TDD in action is available at: https://youtu.be/30IDb-6NgS4.},

  abstract={Collective reflection is essential for pre-service science teachers' professional development which involves participants generating multiple ideas for their reflection exercises. However, current research revealed that it is a challenge for facilitating collective reflection due to its superficial cognition and intangible quality. Considering generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has been demonstrated to be able to help promote teachers' professional development in a large amount of existing research, this study integrated the ChatGPT 4.0 into preservice science teachers' collective reflection. Due to the dynamic and complicated process of collective reflection, Epistemic network analysis (ENA) approach was employed to trace the development process of 14 pre-service science teachers' collaborative discourse patterns in two collective reflection activities after micro-teaching and traditional classroom teaching. Data analysis results revealed that when the pre-service science teachers used ChatGPT in collective reflection, they demonstrated less active on providing critical feedback and analyzing the causes of problems combined pedagogical knowledge and classroom observation. Furthermore, the pre-service science teachers had different highlights in two collective reflection activities. Suggestions are provided to promote the pre-service science teachers' integrated GAI collective reflection.},

  abstract={An antenna inverse design scheme based on generative artificial intelligence (AI) is proposed. The generative AI uses a diffusion model and incorporates a transformer model to output a series of innovative and practical antenna structures according to the input antenna requirements. To select the optimal structure from a large set of candidates, we further incorporate the Characteristic Mode Analysis (CMA) method into the Bilinear Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNN) model for evaluation and selection. The antenna inverse design scheme cleverly combines AI with the CMA method, which greatly simplifies the tedious process of traditional antenna design. By simply inputting the antenna requirements, the optimal antenna structure, distinct from existing datasets, can be rapidly obtained. Since the output is an antenna structure, it is not limited to a specific frequency band, thus offering design flexibility for cross-band adjustments. This letter presents case studies on single-band, dual-band, and wideband circularly polarized microstrip antennas to validate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools are advanced systems capable of generating content in formats such as text, images, or videos, which has been transforming fields such as education. However, excessive use of these tools may result in students not fully utilizing their own skills, thereby diminishing their critical thinking, analytical abilities, and information search skills. This research aims to study the perceptions of higher education students regarding GAI tools to assess their experiences with the usefulness of these instruments and their impact on learning. To achieve this, a non-experimental, comparative, descriptive research approach with a quantitative focus was employed, involving theoretical and conceptual processing. An instrument was designed to measure dimensions such as ethics, experience, usefulness, and quality. Finally, the results revealed that students use and understand basic concepts of GAI tools, recognize their limitations, and are thus familiar with them. The study also identified certain risks related to students' perception of these tools as substitutes for their teachers rather than as supportive aids and noted that they are perceived as potentially diminishing students' learning capacity.},

  abstract={This study examines the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and the work environment on the motivation of formal workers in DKI Jakarta Province. Using IBM SPSS 29 for data analysis, 402 formal workers participated via online questionnaires. Results indicate that GAI positively correlates with work motivation (regression coefficient=0.71, t = 10.98, p < 0.001). Likewise, a favourable work climate considerably boosts motivation (β = 0.63, t = 12.21, p < 0.001). Also, the work environment was found to have a significant indirect effect on the GAI-motivation relationship (β = 0.55, p < 0.001). The results of this research imply that the implementation of sophisticated AI technologies and a favourable organisational climate are the keys to increasing employees’ effectiveness and engagement. Despite the study’s short data collection period, the results are indicative. Strategic investments in GAI and improvements in the work environment could significantly enhance the motivation of Jakarta’s 3.08 million formal workers. This paper provides valuable insights into leveraging GAI and work environment factors to improve employee well-being in Jakarta’s dynamic work context.},

  pages={147-149},
  abstract={Literary studies critically examine fictional texts, exploring their structures, themes, stylistic features, and cultural-historical contexts. A central challenge in this field lies in bridging textual analysis with the spatial and sensory dimensions of settings described or implied in texts. Traditional methodologies often require scholars to mentally reconstruct these environments, leading to incomplete or inconsistent interpretations. Readers may be biased by their personal context or experiences, or may lack detailed knowledge of the relevant historical facts. This paper argues for the integration of virtual reality and generative artificial intelligence as supporting instruments to enhance literary research. The former enables immersive, spatially accurate reconstructions of historical environments, while the latter provides tools such as text-to-image and text-to-3D generation which let us dynamically render visual elements quoted in literary texts. Together, these technologies have the potential to significantly enhance traditional literature analysis methodologies, enabling novel approaches for contextualizing and analyzing literature in its spatial and cultural milieu.},

  pages={1796-1801},
  abstract={This study focuses on the application of generative artificial intelligence in the field of cultural creation and communication, and proposes an innovative multimodal fusion generative adversarial network algorithm (MM-GAN). The algorithm effectively integrates multimodal cultural data such as text, image, and audio by constructing a cultural feature fusion module, a dynamic adversarial training mechanism, and a semantic consistency constraint module. The experiment uses public cultural data sets and self-built characteristic cultural corpora, covering scenes such as poetry creation, film and television poster design, and music melody generation. In the poetry generation task, the BLEU-4 score of poetry generated by MM-GAN reached 0.45, which is higher than the 0.32 of traditional GAN and other baseline models. In the film and television poster design experiment, the average perceptual similarity between the generated poster and the target style is 0.88, far exceeding the comparison algorithm. In terms of music melody generation, the average harmonic rationality score of the generated melody is 4.2 (out of 5 points). The results show that MM-GAN is significantly superior to traditional algorithms in terms of cultural creation quality, style fit and semantic coherence, and can effectively assist cultural creation and dissemination, providing a new path for the development of this field.},

  abstract={Digital literacy plays an important role in teachers’ professional competence, especially in the context of digital transformation in education. With the advancement of digital technology, enhancing learners’ high awareness ability in digital literacy has become a key step in literacy development. On this basis, this study employed the response surface methodology (RSM) to evaluate various test indicators, including the number of words, number of answer points, and number of follow-up rounds, and evaluation indicators, including accuracy, expansion, and awareness, for generative artificial intelligence (GAI). A four-step process was followed that includes basic analysis of experiment results, factor estimation and variance analysis, multifactor response surface analysis, and indicator analysis. The findings indicate that the test factors related to the GAI-generated content had a significant impact on participants’ high awareness levels. These factors exhibited interactive effects, and the response surface model revealed an optimal approach for applying GAI to enhance awareness. Building on these insights, practical suggestions are proposed for using GAI to enhance digital literacy. On the basis of the research conclusions, practical approaches to applying GAI to enhance high awareness ability in digital literacy are proposed. These approaches include employing the critical point perturbation mechanism, role-oriented mechanism, and high awareness thinking chain mechanism. This study employed GAI to investigate learners’ high awareness ability in digital literacy, providing a case for the proper and innovative use of GAI in the context of education. Additionally, it provides information on the educational effectiveness of GAI and offers valuable references for similar studies on GAI applications.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of Generative AI technology, especially the rise of large-scale language models and diffusion models, the field of semantic communication is facing new opportunities and challenges. Traditional semantic communication systems have some limitations in conveying semantic information in a dynamic environment, but generative artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to break through this bottleneck with its ability of context understanding and data generation. This paper proposes GenAI-SC, a generative semantic communication architecture that utilizes large-scale pre-training models for semantic information extraction and adopts a diffusion model as its core. The architecture extracts and compresses semantic information through large-scale models and utilizes diffusion models to achieve high-quality image recovery, which is especially suitable for complex communication environments. To verify the effectiveness of this architecture, this paper design two task modes, plain text diffusion image generation and text-image joint diffusion generation, to flexibly cope with different transmission tasks. The experimental results show that GenAI-SC performs well under different channel conditions and inference steps, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio environment, showing that GenAI-SC has good multitasking capability and communication robustness. This paper provides an innovative path for the design and implementation of semantic communication system.},

  abstract={This study investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated personalized images to address the underrepresentation of female students in university engineering programs and promote gender equality in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). Persistent gender disparities in STEM present significant barriers to diversity and innovation, highlighting the need for innovative strategies to inspire underrepresented groups. The research involved 76 high school students from scientific tracks, who were shown with AI-generated personalized images portraying themselves working in STEM-related professions. Results indicate that self-envisioning in STEM fields increased for both genders after the intervention, with the effect being four times greater for female students. In engineering fields specifically, a significant increase in selfenvisioning was observed among female students, while no significant impact was found for male students-likely due to the historical underrepresentation of women and the influence of gender stereotypes on career aspirations. These findings demonstrate the potential of AI-generated personalized images as a novel tool to reduce gender disparities in STEM. Integrating such an approach into career counseling could enhance participation and foster diversity in STEM disciplines.},

  abstract={With the development of big data technology, traditional audit methods are facing challenges such as huge data volume and increasing complexity. Generative AI provides a new solution for the audit field. To this end, this paper proposes a research plan for audit data analysis and risk identification based on generative AI technology. This study first outlines the application of generative AI in auditing. Then, variational inference is introduced using VAEs to approximate the probability distribution of audit data. In addition, realistic data is adversarially generated by training a generator and a discriminator. Then, through these models, the generated financial data or audit data can be compared with real data to identify potential risks. Finally, this study conducts experiments with sample data. The experimental results show that the generative model performs well in capturing the mean characteristics of the data. The false positive rate of the original generated data is 0.08, and the improved generated data is reduced to 0.04, showing the excellent performance of the improved model in reducing false positives.},

  abstract={Chronic disease management requires continuous care to prevent exacerbations, yet providing 24/7 accessible medical advice is a significant challenge for care providers. The current model of periodic patient visits with standard dialogue responses fails to adequately address the individualized needs of patients and caregivers. This lack of personalized guidance undermines treatment adherence and satisfaction. To bridge this gap, we developed a novel approach leveraging generative AI (GAI) to optimize patient-manager interactions. Focusing on prevalent chronic conditions such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and dementia, we created intelligent dialogue agents that deliver tailored, actionable nursing recommendations aligning with each case's unique circumstances. The developed methodology began by curating a corpus of 30 frequently asked questions on home care, emotional support, and social factors from online patient data across the three diseases. We employed prompt engineering to precisely define the virtual roles of nurses and physicians while implementing a “Rephrase and Respond” (RAR) protocol to enhance query comprehension and generate reliable solutions. The RAR approach solves problems by question restating, followed by contextualized recommendations from the language model. Clinical expert feedback iteratively refined the system's outputs. The evaluation result showed an average gain of 10% in response and an increase of 5% in readability after optimization. The optimized RAR method of large language models effectively improved the quality of nursing advice for chronic disease, aligned with patients' emotional and social needs. The RAR method in medical advisory areas, including chronic disease management and rehabilitation care, enhances the quality and practicality of nursing advice in these domains.},

  abstract={The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence has presented novel opportunities for innovation and practice in the field of education. This study utilizes a questionnaire survey approach to examine the factors influencing the application of Generative Artificial Intelligence in teachers' educational instruction, grounded in Diffusion of Innovation Theory. The research proposes hypotheses that teachers' adoption of Generative Artificial Intelligence in educational instruction is influenced by seven factors: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, visibility, information channels, and teachers' personal innovativeness. Through correlation analysis, it is discovered that these influencing factors are significantly correlated with teachers' adoption and application of Generative Artificial Intelligence in educational instruction. Regression analysis further reveals that compatibility and visibility have significant positive predictive effects on teachers' adoption of Generative Artificial Intelligence. Based on the data results, this study proposes corresponding strategies to further enhance the diffusion of Generative Artificial Intelligence, aiming to improve the quality and efficiency of teachers' educational instruction, reduce their workload, and promote educational equity and high-quality balanced development.},
