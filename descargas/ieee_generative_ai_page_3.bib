  abstract={The widespread use of digital systems and tools in education has opened up opportunities for collecting, measuring, and analysing data about user (learner, teacher) interactions with a variety of learning resources and activities, with the ultimate objective of better understanding learning and advancing both learning outcomes and the overall learning experience. This promise motivated the development of Learning Analytics (LA) as a research and practical field and the use of insights derived from learning trace data for evidence-based decision making in a variety of educational settings. While LA has made a significant contribution to better understanding of learning and the environments in which it takes place, many open questions and challenges remain. Furthermore, new opportunities and challenges continue to emerge with the ever-changing modalities of teaching and learning, the latest of which are associated with the rapid development and accessibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Taking the cyclical model of LA as its exploration framework, this paper examines how key components of the LA model – namely data, methods, and actions – relate to and may benefit from the latest developments in AI, and especially Generative AI. Aiming for evidence-based analysis and discussion of the interplay between LA and AI, the paper relies on the latest empirical research in LA and the related research fields of AI in Education and Educational Data Mining.},

  year={2024},

  pages={2433-2489},
  abstract={As we transition from the 5G epoch, a new horizon beckons with the advent of 6G, seeking a profound fusion with novel communication paradigms and emerging technological trends, bringing once-futuristic visions to life along with added technical intricacies. Although analytical models lay the foundations and offer systematic insights, we have recently witnessed a noticeable surge in research suggesting machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can efficiently deal with complex problems by complementing or replacing model-based approaches. The majority of data-driven wireless research leans heavily on discriminative AI (DAI) that requires vast real-world datasets. Unlike the DAI, Generative AI (GenAI) pertains to generative models (GMs) capable of discerning the underlying data distribution, patterns, and features of the input data. This makes GenAI a crucial asset in wireless domain wherein real-world data is often scarce, incomplete, costly to acquire, and hard to model or comprehend. With these appealing attributes, GenAI can replace or supplement DAI methods in various capacities. Accordingly, this combined tutorial-survey paper commences with preliminaries of 6G and wireless intelligence by outlining candidate 6G applications and services, presenting a taxonomy of state-of-the-art DAI models, exemplifying prominent DAI use cases, and elucidating the multifaceted ways through which GenAI enhances DAI. Subsequently, we present a tutorial on GMs by spotlighting seminal examples such as generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, flow-based GMs, diffusion-based GMs, generative transformers, large language models, autoregressive GMs, to name a few. Contrary to the prevailing belief that GenAI is a nascent trend, our exhaustive review of approximately 120 technical papers demonstrates the scope of research across core wireless research areas, including 1) physical layer design; 2) network optimization, organization, and management; 3) network traffic analytics; 4) cross-layer network security; and 5) localization & positioning. Furthermore, we outline the central role of GMs in pioneering areas of 6G network research, including semantic communications, integrated sensing and communications, THz communications, extremely large antenna arrays, near-field communications, digital twins, AI-generated content services, mobile edge computing and edge AI, adversarial ML, and trustworthy AI. Lastly, we shed light on the multifarious challenges ahead, suggesting potential strategies and promising remedies. Given its depth and breadth, we are confident that this tutorial-cum-survey will serve as a pivotal reference for researchers and professionals delving into this dynamic and promising domain.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is emerging as a transformative technology in higher education, particularly in programming instruction. However, its impact on learning, motivation, and the educational environment must still be fully understood. This study aims to determine the capacity of GenAI to generate effective computer programming learning in STEM university students, comparing it with active learning methods based on video. An experiment was conducted with 40 computer engineering students divided into two groups: one using GenAI (Google Gemini 1.5) and another employing educational videos. Pre- and post-tests of knowledge and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) were applied to evaluate learning, intrinsic motivation, and the learning environment. No significant differences in learning were found between the groups. However, GenAI significantly increased perceived autonomy and reduced perceived effort and pressure, while video-based learning significantly improved perceived competence. These findings suggest that both methods seem to motivate in diverse ways and that they could complement each other in an integrated teaching approach, offering new perspectives for designing programming learning environments in higher education.},

  abstract={In the era of digital intelligence, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into educational practices has the potential to transform traditional teaching methods. Human-machine collaborative teaching (HMCT) is a new paradigm that leverages the strengths of both human educators and AI tools to enhance learning outcomes. This study investigates the effectiveness of three human-machine collaborative teaching strategies—directive, guided, and collaborative-implemented in a university—level software engineering course. The experiment involved 99 third-year students and aimed to evaluate the impact of these teaching strategies on creativity and academic performance. The results show that the collaborative teaching method, enhanced by generative AI tools, led to the highest performance in final exams and overall academic achievement, as well as increased participation in extracurricular innovation activities in homework. While directive teaching produced consistent results, it did not foster the same level of engagement or creativity. Guided teaching demonstrated moderate success, but the greatest benefits were observed in the collaborative approach, where students took an active role in their learning. This study suggests that integrating AI into collaborative learning environments can enhance both academic outcomes and student creativity, and recommends expanding the use of AI-supported strategies in higher education. Future research should explore the scalability of these findings across disciplines and investigate long-term impacts on student development and career readiness.},

  pages={226-230},
  abstract={This study focuses on the value conflicts and practical challenges arising from the application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in education. Based on Weber's dual framework of instrumental rationality and value rationality, combined with Strauss's metaphor of the “second cave” the study systematically analyzes the profound impact of instrumental rationality on the essence of education. While generative AI offers significant advantages in enhancing teaching effectiveness, optimizing resource allocation, and achieving personalized learning, its overuse may lead to the prioritization of utilitarian educational goals and the mechanization of knowledge transmission. In response to this contradiction, the study proposes a “teacher-AI-student” triadic interaction model, emphasizing that the application of technology should adhere to the principles of assistive, transparent, and inclusive use. Innovatively, the study constructs a differentiated educational strategy based on the “learning ability-willingness matrix”, providing precise personalized support for different learners. In the process of digital transformation in education, it is crucial to fully leverage technological advantages while steadfastly adhering to the humanistic values, thereby achieving a dynamic balance between instrumental rationality and value rationality. The study has important theoretical value and practical significance in advancing educational innovation, deepening educational practice reforms, and building a sustainable technology-empowered education model.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={445-449},
  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are becoming increasingly prevalent in higher education, offering students new opportunities for learning and research. However, concerns about the potential for AI to produce inaccurate or misleading information—commonly referred to as "hallucinations"—have raised questions about the impact of these tools on student learning and academic integrity. This research paper examines how students' awareness of AI tools, the types of academic tasks they are assigned, faculty support, and institutional policies influence their perceptions and attitudes toward the use of generative AI for academic purposes. The study utilized a descriptive-correlational design, guided by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which provides insights into how users accept and effectively utilize technology. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed as a robust statistical technique to analyze the impact of various factors on college students' perceptions and attitudes regarding the use of generative AI for academic work. The study's constructs were assessed for reliability and validity using Cronbach's Alpha, Average Variance Extracted (AVE), and the Heterotrait-Monotrait (HTMT) ratio. The findings indicate that the complexity and intensity of academic tasks, students' engagement with generative AI platforms, and the support they receive from educational stakeholders significantly influence their attitudes toward using these platforms for academic assignments. Conversely, students' perceptions of generative AI are heavily shaped by the support systems available to them and their understanding of the potential risks associated with using such technologies for their assignments and projects. This research contributes to the ongoing discussion about the ethical and practical implications of AI in education, providing valuable insights into best practices for integrating AI technologies to enhance learning while upholding academic integrity.},

  abstract={The education of the national common language and script is a fundamental cause related to national unity, ethnic harmony, and social stability. According to the survey, generally, students in Xizang have reached a proficient level in the national common language, but there is still a gap from the standard of accuracy and fluency; the writing level of the national common script is relatively low, with diverse forms of errors. Starting from project-based learning, this paper, combined with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), attempts to explore effective ways to improve the teaching quality of the national common language and script for students in Xizang. It proposes a new model led by GenAI to enhance the learning quality of the national common language among ethnic minorities, drives teachers' teaching and teaching research with tasks, and improves students' learning interest and efficiency, aiming to provide references for more effective project-based teaching of the national common language and script in Xizang.},

  abstract={Over the past few decades, immersive technologies have completely transformed the world around us. Recent trends show that the next digital transformation will directly impact the way people live, communicate, work, trade and learn and will be powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Generative artificial intelligence has had to face significant higher education challenges since its appearance, requiring the development of new and innovative teaching and learning practices. Nevertheless, the assimilation of such immersive technologies necessarily brings with it many challenges, advantages, and risks, which have led to differing opinions among educators, students, and academics. This paper provides a preliminary reflection on the risks and benefits that higher education students perceive in the formal use of this type of tool for academic purposes. An exit survey was used to verify the initial opinions of the students, obtaining almost 90 percent of positive perceptions, but only considering AI as a support tool. In contrast, a significant percentage mentioned that there could be some risks in using this technology: dependency on AI tools, loss of creativity and plagiarism according to institutional policies. Despite its innovative and significant importance, the students acknowledge that the tool is imperfect and accept several disadvantages, such as incorrect answers, poor quality references and the production of unsafe content, so its use must regulate and for now remain only as a complementary support tool.},

  abstract={Computer science has recently experienced a surge in popularity with the release of generative artificial intelligence models. Yet, while the popular imagination has been captured, evidence indicates that pre-college students, especially those from underrepresented populations, lack adequate education about careers in the field. Effective methods for gaining understanding include shadowing professionals or acquiring internships, yet these means are often not attainable or realistic for many students. Overall, this insufficient education can lead to future disadvantages, including future workforce disparities. To address these problems, Computer Science Next (CSNext) is an organization that was founded in early 2024 to convey insights from the current to the next generation of computer scientists. CSNext's first project will be a series of video interviews with leaders in artificial intelligence intended for a high school student audience. Video interviews will be released for free, and responses will be synthesized to share meaningful and insightful commonalities and responses. In addition, a list of the resources discussed in the interview will be cataloged alongside the videos and indexed for the site in its entirety. Particular attention will be focused on inclusivity, including underrepresented minorities, when selecting interview candidates.},

For far too long, leaders have focused on developing technology and AI at the expense of human intelligence &#x2013; and even humanity itself. Ultimately, AI represents a pinnacle of technological advancement. Headlines abound about how AI is coming for most workers today, with many experts projecting profound job loss. The leadership model of the future will be grounded in behaviors that help to develop human skills and create environments that promote human flourishing, despite and because of the increased role of AI. To stay ahead in the digital age, leaders will not only have to upskill workers, especially those considered gray&#x2010;collar, but redefine what it means to engage a workforce with an increased say and growing expectations for leaders themselves.</p>},

The near-field probe, as an important part of near-field scanning, mainly detects the magnetic field or electric field. The measurement accuracy of the near field probe directly affects the measurement accuracy of the electromagnetic field on the surface of the device, affecting the accuracy of electromagnetic compatibility diagnostics. To ensure measurement accuracy, it is essential to carry out near-field probe calibration. In this work, we proposed an artificial intelligence probe calibration method based on the generative adversarial networks, which helps improve the difference of calibration parts’ quality difference measurement field and eliminate the unnecessary influence field on the probe performance. Based on the proposed method, we effectively calibrate two kinds of electric field probes, which overcomes the problem of the difference of calibration parts’ quality difference measurement field, and eliminate the influence of unnecessary field to the probe performance.},

  abstract={As an important artistic creation form and national heritage, painting shows the features of human culture and conveys human thoughts and feelings through beautiful forms of expression, which is a unique form of human understanding of the world. Image generation algorithm is actually the transformation from one image to another, and image synthesis is an important research direction in the field of computer vision. In this paper, the AI (artificial intelligence) art image synthesis algorithm based on generation model is studied. By studying the development of GAN (Generative Adversary Networks), this paper proposes an AI art image synthesis algorithm based on GAN. An hourglass-shaped CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) with layer hopping connection is designed, which consists of coding and decoding. By adding corresponding interval convolution layers, the underlying texture information of the image is preserved, and the identity loss is maintained, so that the original image and the generated image are consistent in color. The results show that all three CNN models have high recognition accuracy for data sets, and the recognition accuracy for both data sets is higher than 99%. The algorithm in this paper is superior to other comparison algorithms in RMSE and PSNR. Experimental results show that this method improves the quality of generated images.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the augmented responsibility of human Artificial Intelligence experts in the era of empowered pre-made Artificial Intelligence (AI). The responsible and ethical use of pre-made AI is of paramount importance in this evolving technology. AI systems have the potential to impact numerous aspects of society, ranging from healthcare and finance to education and IoT. The decisions made by AI algorithms can have significant consequences for individuals, communities, and even entire industries. Using a comparison to the way widely available medicines require a prescription from medical doctors, human AI experts assume the role of evaluating, recommending, and overseeing the implementation of AI systems, even when pre-built AI solutions may seem user-friendly on the surface. The paper has explored the expanded responsibilities of human AI experts within two contemporary scenarios involving pre-made AI, encompassing LLMs and ChatGPT. These AI technologies are applied in two principal manners: initially, as standalone AI products readily accessible to a wide audience, and secondly, as elements undergoing exploration for integration into other AI-driven software and Intelligent Information Systems (IIS), with the goal of enhancing natural language processing (NLP) features within user interfaces. In all cases, the expertise of human AI professionals is indispensable, and their role is augmented. These professionals bear an increased responsibility for ensuring the responsible and ethical deployment of AI technologies, with a focus on human-centered design, bias mitigation, validation and accuracy estimation of the results, transparency promotion, and the necessary balance between automation and human oversight. This paper performs a review on pre-made AI and ChatGPT together with custom-based AI and shows that recent advance require an augmented role of human AI experts},

  abstract={Intelligent design has been an emerging important area in the design. Existing works related to intelligent design use objective indicators to measure the quality of AI design by comparing the differences between AI-generated data and real data. However, the level of quality and efficiency of intelligent design compared to human designers remains unclear. We conducted user experiments to compare the design quality and efficiency of advanced design methods with that of junior designers. The conclusion is advanced intelligent design methods are comparable with junior designers on painting. Besides, intelligent design uses only 10% of the time spent by the junior designer in the tasks of layout design, color matching, and video editing.},

  abstract={In the field of computer image vision, with the rise of artificial intelligence and deep learning, the image style migration techniques used are becoming more and more sophisticated. To address the problem that style migration based on traditional techniques has strong limitations and one procedure can only implement a single scene, this paper first discusses the model structures of ANN (artificial neural network) and MLP (multi-layer perceptron), and the loss functions, and then the design and implementation of an artificial intelligence animation stylized system based on ANN and MLP is proposed. Through the test results of the system, it can be verified that the algorithm implementation used in the system corresponds to multiple types of image styles, and the results of migration conversion can also achieve a high degree of agreement with the original image samples, finally A system for converting multiple image styles has been implemented.},

  abstract={With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), a lot of spheres in life and work have been introduced to a new stage, and English literature cannot be an exception here. It proposes an investigatory research paper that tries to unmask the intersections between AI technologies and literary creativity, delving into how, in fact, such digital novelties are turning the scenery of English literature upside down. This paper will, at first, make an attempt to give some sort of comprehensive overview of the current state of AI technologies. Among the AI tools and algorithms, it is the special attention of somehow making their applications within the realm of literary creation, analysis, and interpretation. The core of these studies plunges into the details of what AI has to do with generating literary content, be it through algorithms writing poems, short stories, and even novels in the style of famous authors or totally from scratch. This study expands the scope of consideration to the collaborative processes between human authors and AI, focusing on synergetic potential for creative exploration and emergence of hybrid authorial identities. In addition, implications of the use of AI in literary analysis were described due to the fact that it is being applied to reveal new critical insights into classic texts using machine-learning models, predicting the future direction of literature, and even critiquing—again using a similar style generator—works of literature with a degree of insight thought previously exclusive to human scholars. Another important focus area will be the pedagogical implications for integrating AI into English literature education.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) can be broadly described as an artificial intelligence system capable of generating images, text, and other media types with human prompts. GAI models like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Bard have recently caught the attention of industry and academia equally. GAI applications span various industries like art, gaming, fashion, and healthcare. In healthcare, GAI shows promise in medical research, diagnosis, treatment, and patient care and is already making strides in real-world deployments. There has yet to be any detailed study concerning the applications and scope of GAI in healthcare. Addressing this research gap, we explore several applications, real-world scenarios, and limitations of GAI in healthcare. We examine how GAI models like ChatGPT and DALL-E can be leveraged to aid in the applications of medical imaging, drug discovery, personalized patient treatment, medical simulation and training, clinical trial optimization, mental health support, healthcare operations and research, medical chatbots, human movement simulation, and a few more applications. Along with applications, we cover four real-world healthcare scenarios that employ GAI: visual snow syndrome diagnosis, molecular drug optimization, medical education, and dentistry. We also provide an elaborate discussion on seven healthcare-customized LLMs like Med-PaLM, BioGPT, DeepHealth, etc.,Since GAI is still evolving, it poses challenges like the lack of professional expertise in decision making, risk of patient data privacy, issues in integrating with existing healthcare systems, and the problem of data bias which are elaborated on in this work along with several other challenges. We also put forward multiple directions for future research in GAI for healthcare.},

  pages={402-408},
  abstract={Utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods in medical imaging has completely changed how early disease screening is done, leading to big gains in accuracy, speed, and patient results. This essay looks at how AI can improve medical images. It focuses on deep learning algorithms, computer vision, and machine learning models that can make complicated diagnosis tasks easier to do automatically. These technologies make it possible to find and study small trends in medical pictures that a person might miss. This helps doctors make faster and more accurate diagnoses, especially in cancer, heart, and neurology. AI can find problems in X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and its performance is on par with or even better than that of expert doctors. The paper also looks at how AI can be used to predict diseases by looking at old image data along with clinical factors. Researchers are looking at techniques like reinforcement learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to see if they can improve picture quality and help make fake data for rare diseases. This will help make diagnosis tools that are more accurate. The study also shows how AI is becoming more and more important for solving problems like inconsistent data, picture noise, and wrong interpretations. As healthcare continues to go digital, adding AI to medical imaging systems could help with personalized treatment plans, lower the number of mistakes made during diagnosis, and speed up work processes.},

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications are advanced AI designed to generate human-like responses by processing natural language inputs. These applications leverage machine learning models to produce outputs that can assist users in a variety of tasks from writing to coding. The integration of Generative AI with CURE had been adopted in a text-based machine learning course during the Fall 2023 semester. A comparative analysis had been conducted on student survey responses from Fall 2022 and Fall 2023 to evaluate the effectiveness of Generative AI in a CURE integrated course. Descriptive statistics and statistical tests were conducted to assess differences in student perceptions between the two semesters. Although the differences were not statistically significant, the results indicate a promising trend towards improved student perceptions of both the overall course effectiveness and the benefits of Generative AI in enhancing various aspects of the research process, especially the literature review.},

AI's impact on the field of fine arts focuses on three main areas including machine learning analysis for artwork understanding along with AI-generated art production as well as deep learning approaches for artwork restoration. Experimental studies analyze how AI performs regarding artwork restoration precision as well as artistic coherence maintaining and conservation speed while proving that AI improves upon traditional restoration techniques in terms of precision and scalability. The authentication of AI art creates ethics tests so do biases in databases and issues about cultural preservation. The paper presents the human-AI collaborative model which demonstrates AI functions as a creative enhancement instead of replacing artists. This study delivers a detailed view of AI's changes in artistic practices through research of present-day uses as well as hurdles and upcoming strategies. These findings enhance research about AI and human artistic collaboration by helping both technology development and ethical considerations related to artistic preservation.},

  abstract={The rise of large language models (LLMs) has transformed natural language processing (NLP) and generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications. However, deploying these transformer-based models in resource-constrained environments poses a significant challenge due to their high computational and memory demands. To address this, we introduce in this article generative AI (GenAI) on the Edge, a comprehensive benchmarking dataset designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs deployed on edge devices. Leveraging a distributed testbed of Raspberry Pi 5 devices orchestrated with lightweight Kubernetes (K3s), the dataset captures a broad range of performance metrics essential for assessing the feasibility of local inference in constrained environments. These metrics include detailed measurements of throughput, inference latency, memory utilization, and computational efficiency, along with granular timing data for key stages of the inference pipeline—sample, prefill, and decode phases. We systematically evaluate LLMs of varying sizes under real-world deployment scenarios, with a particular emphasis on CPU-based edge platforms. By conducting multiple runs of conversation-based evaluations, GenAI on the Edge provides actionable insights into the tradeoffs between performance and resource efficiency, enabling better decision-making for LLM deployment in edge environments.

  abstract={The capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) evolve rapidly and affect almost all sectors of society. AI has been increasingly integrated into criminal and harmful activities, expanding existing vulnerabilities, and introducing new threats. This article reviews the relevant literature, reports, and representative incidents which allows to construct a typology of the malicious use and abuse of systems with AI capabilities. The main objective is to clarify the types of activities and corresponding risks. Our starting point is to identify the vulnerabilities of AI models and outline how malicious actors can abuse them. Subsequently, we explore AI-enabled and AI-enhanced attacks. While we present a comprehensive overview, we do not aim for a conclusive and exhaustive classification. Rather, we provide an overview of the risks of enhanced AI application, that contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the issue. Specifically, we suggest four types of malicious abuse of AI (integrity attacks, unintended AI outcomes, algorithmic trading, membership inference attacks) and four types of malicious use of AI (social engineering, misinformation/fake news, hacking, autonomous weapon systems). Mapping these threats enables advanced reflection of governance strategies, policies, and activities that can be developed or improved to minimize risks and avoid harmful consequences. Enhanced collaboration among governments, industries, and civil society actors is vital to increase preparedness and resilience against malicious use and abuse of AI.},

  abstract={Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are a strategic sector in the economy that requires continuous innovation in digital marketing strategies. As the need for attractive, professional, and easily accessible promotional content increases, generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) technology is a potential solution to support the efficiency and quality of visual design. This study explores how design thinking and generative AI can be used to create attractive and professional visual content. This study uses a design thinking method with seven stages including understand, observe, define point of view, ideate, prototype, test, and reflect. Each step uses specific tools such as persona profile canvas, feedback capture grids, and retrospective boards, as well as generative AI tools used in prototypes such as Canva AI, Prome AI, Leonardo AI and others to create faster and more optimal designs. The results of the study show that the use of AI in promotional materials significantly improves the efficiency and branding of MSMEs, enabling the production of high-quality content at a lower cost. However, challenges remain, related to the limited scope of the study which only focuses on one sector, namely Muslim fashion MSMEs and the lack of AI's ability to understand the nuances of brand identity in depth. This study contributes to increasing the understanding of the synergy between design thinking and generative AI, as it can provide practical guidance for MSMEs in optimizing digital marketing, and suggests future research that focuses more on assisting MSMEs directly in implementing AI in their businesses.},

  pages={1796-1799},
  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have rapidly risen to prominence in the sphere of deep learning. This is especially true when it comes to image generation, where GANs have displayed impressive capabilities. Over time, as researchers have grappled with the challenges posed by the original GAN model, a plethora of GAN variants have been introduced. These are tailored to counteract training instability, mode collapse, and various other challenges intrinsic to the base GAN model. Despite the extensive variety of GAN techniques available, there is still a knowledge gap when it comes to understanding their relative performances on specific datasets. For many practitioners, choosing the right GAN model for a given dataset remains a trial-and-error endeavor. In an attempt to shed light on this matter, our research undertakes a deep dive into three of the most notable GAN techniques: the classic GAN, the one built upon Wasserstein Distance, often abbreviated as W-GAN, and its subsequent evolution, WGAN-GP.},

  abstract={In industrial production, Explainable Artificial Intelligence offers the opportunity to better understand AI models, not only to understand their decisions but also to be able to improve processes, which is possible even without the necessary experience. There are several widely used methods to implement this for Artificial Intelligence models, but no uniform standards and definitions. There are also still some hurdles on a technical and legal level as well as trust on the human side. Ultimately, the application of such techniques is particularly important in this area, but this is often not possible without the well-functioning and widespread use of Artificial Intelligence in manufacturing industry. However, it is a further step towards intelligent manufacturing and the acceptance of Artificial Intelligence in this area. The publication not only shows the latest developments, but also some use cases of Explainable Artificial Intelligence in manufacturing. Not only legal aspects but also ethical aspects are highlighted. In conclusion, it can be stated that Explainable Artificial Intelligence methods per se are well established, but their implementation and use in practice is lagging behind. A major point here in the future will be the explanation of generative artificial intelligence and user-centred explanations for non-domain experts. A standardised definition of explainability and standards for evaluating the individual methodologies must also be created.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly popular, so too does the frequency it is attacked. One area where artificial intelligence models are being embraced heavily is avionics, where it is used in a variety of areas including intrusion detection, surveillance, radar, navigation, and more. These networks are vulnerable to a number of attacks, one of which being the adversarial attack. Adversarial attacks aim to perturb the input to the image classification model, which can lead to output misclassifications, lowering the overall model accuracy. This paper will demonstrate how such an attack can lower the accuracy of a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on an aircraft image dataset. The perturbed inputs will be generated by a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on the same dataset as the CNN. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator. The generator will continually create new images based off of the dataset, while the discriminator decides whether or not the image is generated or from the reference dataset. This forms a feedback loop, where the generator continues to improve based on the output of the discriminator. Once trained, the outputs of the GAN will be used to misclassify the trained CNN in an attempt to lower the model’s accuracy. Following this, adversarial defenses such as feature squeezing and random smoothing will be discussed. These defenses attempt to mitigate the damage done by an attack, usually by adapting the model, modifying the input, or modifying the data the model is trained on. This can cause the accuracy of the model to slightly fall from its original accuracy, but with the benefit of being more resilient to adversarial attacks. We analyze this tradeoff and highlight the advantages of adversarial training in learning-enabled avionics systems.},

  abstract={The introduction of synthetic intellect in the processes and procedures also termed artificial intelligence (AI) has risen as a disruptive catalyst across many different sectors. AI has found widespread application in automated systems, financing, and healthcare. With the increasing use of AI, models and algorithms have started surpassing the significant ideals of human performance. The significance of generative AI (GenAI) lies in its concentration on the realms of knowledge work and creative labor, which encompasses a significant number of humans, totalling billions. Procreative AI or GenAI has the potential of enhancing the efficiency and creativity of people by at least 10%. It can also improve their speed, efficiency, and overall capabilities to some extent. GenAI possesses the capability of generating immense economic value up to trillions of dollars. AI systems used to be rule-based and had limited capabilities. The emergence of algorithms for deep learning toward the century’s end paved the way for more sophisticated GenAI models. GenAI is a specialized branch of AI that specifically concentrates on the production of novel content, including audio, video, and writings, through the utilization of artificially intelligent deep learning algorithms. Implementing AI for decision- making in sustainable project life cycle operations remains difficult. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has empowered developers to engage with generative algorithms, effectively transforming natural language queries into code for diverse programming languages. Highly advanced technologies such as Codacy and OpenAI Codex are widely utilized to assist LLMs and their adoption is steadily growing. GenAI solutions leverage aspects such as “completion” to significantly improve the creation of software. AI is extensively used in a number of manufacturing organizations, including those in healthcare, finance, robotics, and automation. However, using AI to make decisions in sustainable project life cycle management is still a difficult undertaking. The present research explores the utilization of AI techniques for decision-making to promote sustainable operations throughout the various phases of a project life cycle. This chapter compares the existing GenAI project life cycles and also suggests the practical framework, as also provides the various futuristic recommendations for sustainable project life cycles.},

  abstract={This paper explores the application of Generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, in urban energy management, assessing human users’ trust in AI systems that, while often accurate, can still make mistakes. It examines how different stakeholder groups—AI experts, energy domain experts, and non-experts—develop trust, distrust, or overtrust in AI-generated outputs and highlights the risks associated with these trust states. While overtrust can lead to blind reliance on incorrect AI outputs, distrust can result in the unnecessary rejection of accurate AI recommendations, ultimately reducing the effectiveness of AI-assisted decision-making. Using the VIRTSI (Variability and Impact of Reciprocal Trust States towards Intelligent Systems) methodology, this research monitors human-AI trust evolution through Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and quantifies trust behaviors using user-adapted Confusion Matrices, addressing a critical gap in AI trust dynamics that traditional acceptance models overlook. The findings validate VIRTSI’s ability to track trust transitions. The study reveals that AI experts exhibit skepticism due to their awareness of AI’s limitations, energy experts tend to overtrust AI, likely influenced by its confident and seemingly reliable responses, and non-experts display inconsistent trust, highlighting decision-making challenges. These findings confirm VIRTSI’s premise that trust in AI is dynamic, varies by user expertise, and must be continuously monitored and assessed. Ultimately, this study strengthens VIRTSI as a necessary framework for assessing and optimizing trust in AI-driven sustainability solutions, ensuring that AI systems are not only trusted but also used effectively and responsibly in energy applications. Unlike other models of technology acceptance that focus solely on adoption, VIRTSI provides a continuous and quantifiable approach to trust calibration, identifying harmful trust patterns and guiding improvements in AI-human interaction over time.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is widely recognized as one of the most influential technologies for the future, having sparked a paradigm shift in scientific research. The field of education has also been greatly impacted by this transformative technology, with researchers exploring the applications of generative AI, particularly ChatGPT, in education. However, existing research primarily focuses on generating text from text, and there remains a relative scarcity of studies on leveraging multimodal generation capabilities to address key challenges in multimodal data supported instruction. In this article, we present a technical framework for generating Tang poetry situational videos, emphasizing the utilization of generative AI to address the need for multimedia teaching resources. Our framework comprises three main modules: textual situational comprehension, image creation, and video generation. Moreover, we have developed a situational video generation system that incorporates various technologies, including text-to-text generation models, text-to-image generation models, image interpolation, text-to-speech synthesis, and video synthesis. To ascertain the efficacy of the modules within the Tang poetry situational video generation system, we undertook a comparative analysis utilizing the prevalent text-to-image and text-to-video generation models. The empirical findings indicate that our approach is capable of generating images that exhibit greater semantic similarity with the poems, thereby enabling a better comprehension of the poem's connotations and its key components. Concurrently, the Tang poetry videos generated can significantly contribute to the reduction of cognitive load and the enhancement of understanding during the learning process. Our research showcases the potential of generative AI in the education field, specifically in the domain of multimodal teaching resources.},

  abstract={Significant progress has been achieved in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) in recent years. Nevertheless, a significant gap continues to exist in the effective surveillance of human actions, activities, and the recognition of human movements or poses. Machines and computers are fundamentally incapable of comprehending human activities without user intervention. Consequently, we now depend on technology to record and archive human actions through live broadcast data, videos, or images. The field of pose estimation, which is a critical area of research with applications in fields such as Augmented Reality, Animation, Gaming, Healthcare, and Sports, is expanding due to the rapid advancement of computer vision technology. This project implements innovative methods to train models and deter- mine poses, utilizing random inputs from internet images, videos, and live streaming. In particular, models that have been trained with artificial intelligence have been created for daily physical activities that necessitate intricate pose estimation. The initial step in the project is to utilize MediaPipe to estimate the poses of the human body. Subsequently, the angles between the body joints are calculated to create the desired models. Additionally, a web-based user interface (WEB-UI) was developed to enable access from any location. The methodology involves the extraction of data from critical body locations, the framing of models, and the utilization of the MediaPipe model due to its superior performance and features in comparison to other models. The objective of this method is to develop a web application for end-users, train AI models for daily physical activities, and establish an efficient system for single human pose estimation. This approach provides a cost-effective alternative to physical trainers and enables the monitoring of health and sports activities to be enhanced.},

  volume={5},

  pages={480-489},
  abstract={The unprecedented circumstances encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic in a variety of life aspects such as health, economy, and environment have urged the humanity to devise new solutions to control and mitigate the impact of the pandemic. Motivated by the high-accuracy decision-making capabilities of artificial intelligence, this article aims to highlight the effectiveness of artificial intelligence applications in the areas of virus detection, health monitoring, face mask detection, crowd sensing, and satellite-based environment monitoring. One of the most promising deep learning techniques presented in the literature is the convolutional neural network (CNN) that has shown remarkable classification accuracy. The reason for using artificial intelligence in this area is the inherent difficulty of these applications such as detecting COVID-19 infections using lung images due to its resemblance with other respiratory diseases. While the lack of sufficient training data is considered one of the main difficulties, it has been alleviated with the aid of specialized artificial intelligence techniques such as generative adversarial networks and transfer learning. Satellite-based imagery along with deep learning have shown an improvement in the air quality due to the imposed mobility restrictions during the pandemic. Apart from the technical challenges, some applications faced social and ethical challenges that are mainly related to the patient privacy. The latter factor have made dataset availability more limited, and restricted the implementation of some applications such as contact tracing. This work examines state-of-the-art studies and shows the effectiveness of artificial intelligence in solving the most challenging technical problems encountered during the pandemic.},

  abstract={In the pursuit of a more inclusive, equitable, and diverse workplace, many organizations are turning to artificial intelligence as a transformative approach to enhance hiring practices. By automating resume evaluations, AI systems can reduce the impact of human biases that often lead to the underrepresentation of certain demographic groups. However, the use of AI in recruitment presents its own set of challenges, including the potential for biased algorithms, lack of transparency, and over-reliance on automation. This paper explores the benefits, challenges, and limitations of using AI to assess resumes, with a particular focus on how AI can enhance EDI in hiring practices. Through the review of various AI tools and case studies, the paper examines how AI can be leveraged to promote fairness, consistency, and access to diverse talent pools. Additionally, the paper discusses solutions to mitigate the risks of bias, such as diversifying training datasets, increasing transparency through explainable AI models, and ensuring human oversight in decision-making. Ultimately, this paper provides recommendations for organizations seeking to integrate AI into their recruitment process while ensuring that it fosters an inclusive and equitable hiring environment.},

  abstract={The gaming industry continually faces the challenge of high costs and extensive time requirements for producing 2D assets. Gaming studies hire and pay high costs to artists to create images for the game which is also time consuming. With the pervasive integration of artificial intelligence across various sectors, the application of AI in game development presents a promising solution to these challenges. This study focuses on the comparison and outcomes of two advanced generative AI tools, DALL-E and Midjourney, to reduce the time and cost associated with the creation of dynamic 2D game assets. The comparison process for both the AI tools involves creation of a Unity based game that integrates DALL-E and Midjourney to generate dynamic game assets which were used in the gameplay to get the user feedback inside the game. The findings reveal that both DALL-E and Midjourney significantly reduce the time and financial barriers traditionally associated with game asset creation, democratizing game development and allowing smaller studios to produce competitive content. DALL-E was found to be highly effective in rapidly transforming textual descriptions into high-quality visual assets, making it superior in terms of speed and cost-efficiency compared to Midjourney. Player feedback indicated a higher level of satisfaction and engagement with DALL-E-generated assets, particularly due to its superior performance in handling prompts and generating contextually relevant images.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to reshape the creative landscape of filmmaking, particularly in the domain of screenwriting. Once relegated to speculative fiction, AI now emerges as a practical co-creator, offering tools capable of generating compelling narratives from minimal input. This study explores the evolving role of AI in screenwriting by evaluating story outputs generated by Bard AI against those written by human screenwriters. Using a structured, two-phase research design, the investigation compares the narratives based on five qualitative variables: plot, narration, character development, dialogue, and cultural relevance. A three-tiered input strategy—ranging from basic to extended prompts—was adopted to assess the AI's creative flexibility and responsiveness. Results show that while AI-generated stories demonstrate coherence, stylistic fluency, and efficient scene setting, they fall short in emotional depth, cultural nuance, and imaginative progression. Human-written scripts, though less structured, excel in dialogue and subtextual character portrayal. The findings highlight the potential of AI as a valuable tool in early-stage ideation and structural support, especially for Gen Z creators, while reaffirming the irreplaceable role of human imagination in storytelling. This research advocates for a hybrid screenwriting model, where AI serves as a creative assistant rather than a substitute for human authorship.},

  abstract={This paper examines the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Knowledge Management (KM), highlighting how AI reshapes traditional KM practices in organizations. It starts by reviewing historical KM frameworks, particularly the SECI model, which emphasizes the transformation between tacit and explicit knowledge. It differentiates generative AI from earlier AI models in terms of output nature, learning adaptability, and application scope. The study explores AI's potential to improve KM processes, focusing on how it influences social interactions, facilitates knowledge community development, and fosters collaborative intelligence by leveraging the strengths of both AI and human capabilities. AI's transformative role in KM includes enhancing knowledge creation, storage, and dissemination, accelerating processes like externalization and combination in the SECI model. However, the paper notes AI's current limitations in managing tacit knowledge and human-centric decision-making. The research underscores AI's capacity to streamline KM processes, improve efficiency, and unlock new opportunities for organizations. By integrating AI tools with human expertise, organizations can enhance their ability to manage, share, and apply knowledge, setting the stage for innovative approaches to knowledge-driven growth and decision-making in diverse contexts.},

  abstract={This work explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve research skills in engineering education, specifically at the time of conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). While AI has previously been employed for basic tasks related to SLRs, such as relevant paper screening and classification within scope, there is still limited research on information retrieval from the full texts of scientific papers. This study focuses on the next phase in the SLR, which involves scientific documentary analysis. The methodology presented in this work compares the AI tools in the market to facilitate scientific documentary analysis and enhance and refine research skills in engineering students. Also, this paper addresses the challenges to automatically run documentary analysis during a SLR. To do so, several techniques to extract information from AIs are presented, including Application Programming Interfaces (API) or Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). According to the results, most of the AI tools have a limitation in the operations students can perform per day. Only PDFgear offers a no-cost solution with unlimited usage, while some other AI tools allow limited usage for not so high prize. In conclusion, this paper presents a contribution during the documentary analysis of a SLR. It is important to keep in mind the constraints associated with the limited usage of AIs, the accuracy of AI tools, or the complexity of the developed scripts for automating the process. Due to the rapidly changing market for artificial intelligence, the validity of this study is limited to the current state of the tools. Similar studies will be necessary as AI tools continue to evolve.},
