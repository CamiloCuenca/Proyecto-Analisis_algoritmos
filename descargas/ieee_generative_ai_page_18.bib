  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={487-492},
  abstract={Due to the huge differences in scene complexity and object scale of different images, local image redrawing is a very challenging task. Existing work generally focuses on the completeness and uniformity of objects before and after local redrawing, however, it neglects the reasonableness of the object scale and the naturalness of the object scene articulation. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel framework for image local redrawing, called Adaptive Fusion Local Redrawing Model (AFLRM), which is capable of adaptively generating accurate masks and optimizing mask edge processing. Specifically, we implement an adaptive mask generation technique that can dynamically adjust the mask size according to the complex scale relationships between scenes and objects adaptively. At the same time, the fusion prompt guides the dynamic adjustment of mask edge blurring and the number of reserved pixels, which effectively reduces the transition traces between the generated content and the original image, and realizes a more natural fusion redrawing effect. And based on this, a consistent framework for automatically expanding image data is designed, which can effectively solve the problem of insufficient experimental data in some fields through the automatic redrawing of data. Extensive experiments on the public datasets COCO and EditBench show that our AFLRM achieves high-quality local redrawing, is general and robust, and provides a good balance between uniformity before and after object redrawing as well as object scale articulation rationality.},

  abstract={With the advancement in Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially generative AI, conversational agents are becoming a norm in everyday lives. These agents can become more intelligent if they can collaborate with humans or other agents in analysing the conversation with the user. This work presents the use of AI to connect different sets of users and help them solve their life problems. Currently, sharing the wisdom of the old generation is happening within the close family or the student circle alone. To receive knowledge from a wider community at their fingertips, we designed a chatbot called wisdomBOT which can connect the younger generation users with the older generation users to receive their wisdom through the sharing of life experiences and stories and to learn from them. It also helps to address the loneliness of the older generation and connect them through a new way to make younger friends.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence has recently emerged as a transformative technology which is able to analyze vast datasets and generate valuable insights, particularly in supply chain management. Simultaneously, the proliferation of Internet of Behaviors which collects and analyzes data on human behaviors enables businesses to gain a deeper understanding of user preferences and habits. Despite the growing adoption of generative artificial intelligence and Internet of Behaviors, their interaction and combined impacts on supply chain management remain underexplored. This study aims to address this gap by examining how generative artificial intelligence and Internet of Behaviors can be leveraged to enhance business operations. To be specific, we first review the relevant literature to identify the key issues and challenges associated with generative artificial intelligence and Internet of Behaviors. We then discuss real-world applications to illustrate the practical value these technologies bring to businesses. Based on the collected literature and industry practices, we propose a framework for businesses to integrate generative artificial intelligence and Internet of Behaviors into their supply chain management. This framework highlights the significant opportunities for businesses to enhance their supply chain performance by adopting these advanced technologies. Finally, we build a future research agenda and draw our conclusion.},

  abstract={The evolution of consumer electronics is increasingly driven by advancements in industrial automation, where generative artificial intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role, particularly in intent-based systems. This study presents a comprehensive framework for integrating generative AI into intent-based industrial automation, which aims to align high-level business goals with precise operational tasks on the factory floor. The proposed architecture synergistically combines three main components: Business Intents, the Intent Layer, and the Factory Floor Shop. This framework leverages foundation models such as the most prominent large language models (LLMs) and advanced communication technologies to translate strategic business intents—such as cost optimization, order management, and market adaptation into actionable tasks to improve operational efficiency, responsiveness, and strategic alignment. We also propose a process of fine-tuning LLMs to optimize their interaction flow within the intent-based system, highlighting the augmentation techniques employed to adapt LLMs for industrial contexts. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and show percentage improvements compared to pretrained LLM models.},

  title={Comparing Generative AI Literature Reviews Versus Human-Led Systematic Literature Reviews: A Case Study on Big Data Research}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={13},
  number={},
  pages={56210-56219},
  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming research methodologies, including Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs). While traditional, human-led SLRs are labor-intensive, AI-driven approaches promise efficiency and scalability. However, the reliability and accuracy of AI-generated literature reviews remain uncertain. This study investigates the performance of GPT-4-powered Consensus in conducting an SLR on Big Data research, comparing its results with a manually conducted SLR. To evaluate Consensus, we analyzed its ability to detect relevant studies, extract key insights, and synthesize findings. Our human-led SLR identified 32 primary studies (PSs) and 207 related works, whereas Consensus detected 22 PSs, with 16 overlapping with the manual selection and 5 false positives. The AI-selected studies had an average citation count of 202 per study, significantly higher than the 64.4 citations per study in the manual SLR, indicating a possible bias toward highly cited papers. However, none of the 32 PSs selected manually were included in the AI-generated results, highlighting recall and selection accuracy limitations. Key findings reveal that Consensus accelerates literature retrieval but suffers from hallucinations, reference inaccuracies, and limited critical analysis. Specifically, it failed to capture nuanced research challenges and missed important application domains. Precision, recall, and F1 scores of the AI-selected studies were 76.2%, 38.1%, and 50.6%, respectively, demonstrating that while AI retrieves relevant papers with high precision, it lacks comprehensiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a hybrid AI-human SLR framework, where AI enhances search efficiency while human reviewers ensure rigor and validity. While AI can support literature reviews, human oversight remains essential for ensuring accuracy and depth. Future research should assess AI-assisted SLRs across multiple disciplines to validate generalizability and explore domain-specific LLMs for improved performance.},

  abstract={The design of complex cyber-physical systems involves balancing multiple, often conflicting performance objectives. In practice, some design requirements remain implicit, embedded in the intuition and expertise of seasoned designers who have worked on similar systems for years. These designers rely on their experience to explore a limited set of promising design candidates, evaluating or simulating them with detailed but computationally slow scientific models. The typical goal is to produce a diverse array of high-performing configurations that offer flexibility in trade-offs and avoid premature commitment to a specific design. In this invited talk, we describe an AI assistant that leverages neuro-symbolic machine learning to automate parts of the system design process. Our approach extends oracle-guided inductive synthesis by integrating a hierarchy of oracles, ranging from slow, detailed scientific models to faster but lower-fidelity deep neural network surrogates and symbolic rules. This approach accelerates design iterations, especially during early design phases. We employ deep generative models in the form of fine-tuned large language models to learn the valid design space, followed by joint exploration and optimization across this learned manifold. This allows the generation of a diverse set of optimal designs based on specified performance objectives.},

The grayscale cartoon image from sketch is generated with conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN), the conditions of cGAN will have some effects on the grayscale image such as edge and shade. The final color cartoon image from the grayscale image is generated with Encoder-Decoder UNet, and in this phase, both the prior global and local user hints information will be introduced to control the final color scheme. The benefit of this two phases approach is to generate the high-quality color cartoon image while allowing users to control final effect with more user guide involved. The two phases colorization could be done in almost real-time and user could take tuning for the generated color cartoon image interactively.},

  abstract={Radio astronomy is one of the essential branches of space sciences where astronomers explore the universe by collecting data using various tools. The radio telescope is one of the principal tools for receiving celestial objects' emissions. How-ever, radio frequency interference (RFI) detection, mitigation, and avoidance are some of the main challenges in astronomical radio data. Additionally, they are essential steps for selecting the best site to initiate the radio telescope. RFI mitigation is arduous because interference can take a wide range of forms and affects different scientific goals. The substantial challenges of handling large radio data volumes make it a good application of deep learning (DL). The research aims to mitigate the interference using a DL-based approach, specifically, conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), because of its powerful ability to differentiate the interference and the clean data.},

  year={2023},

  number={},
  pages={419-424},
  abstract={Training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) requires large amounts of data, and creating sufficiently large datasets to generate images of faces with attributes of a specific group is difficult. In this study, we propose a few-shot method to rapidly generate high-quality images of faces with features associated with a specific group. Our proposed approach comprises two techniques, Pivotal Tuning Inversion (PTI) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PTI consists of two processes: Inversion and Pivotal Tuning. The images of the dataset are projected into the latent space as latent vectors by Inversion, and the pretrained weights of the generator are tuned to adapt to the dataset by Pivotal Tuning. The distribution with the features of the group is obtained from the latent vectors using PCA. Since training on the dataset requires only a short computational time by using these techniques, our method is faster than the previous few-shot methods in the image generation process. With three datasets each containing approximately 100 face images of members of specific groups, the experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved the generation of higher-quality images with the features of the group in a shorter computational time than all previous few-shot methods.},

  abstract={Since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, there is growing interest around the world on exploring the capabilities of generative AI tools. In addition to text, image, audio, and video generation, these tools are also able to generate program codes. In this paper, strategies for students, programmers and enthusiasts to understand the prompting methods to generate codes in multiple languages by translating source code written in one language to another target language using generative AI is explored. The prompts are created to test the ability of generative AI to create codes in C, Java, C++, and Python. Some of the methods of generating the complete program using limited original source code statements is presented. In summary, while generating source code in a target language, generative AI tools downplay the significance of accuracy of statements written in original language, syntax, semantics, as well as missing statements in a program. Irrespective of these, generative AI tools are still able to generate complete code in a target language by correcting errors.},

  abstract={For GAN-based Person Re-identification (Re-ID), the key is to generate pedestrian images with higher identity consistency and meanwhile larger intra-class diversity. Generally, the main discriminative parts focus on some local regions from the foreground of each pedestrian image for Re-ID, and they should be irrelevant to the background. Whereas, most existing methods generate pedestrian images only based on global features, which difficultly achieves emphasizing crucial local regions and weakening the background. Based on this, we propose a CAM-enhancing generative Re-ID method in which the global and local features are jointly used. In the proposed method, an adaptive CAM-enhancing local encoder is designed to explore the significance of local appearances and enhance the effect of crucial local features in generations, where the foreground is divided into multiple local parts and separated from the background by pedestrian segmentation. Moreover, a new generation loss is proposed to supervise the identity consistency by reducing the inconsistency of crucial regions in foregrounds and meanwhile enrich the intra-class diversity by generating variant backgrounds. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method obtains better generation images and Re-ID performance than other methods.},

  pages={19-25},
  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are an emerging technology in Artificial Intelligence (AI). They are an unsupervised learning framework that involves automatically learning patterns from input data to generate synthetic output that closely resembles the original input. GANs enable the creation of datasets by replicating copies of fake outputs based on given inputs. Using GANs, machines can generate unique content that is distinct from human-created data. GANs are widely used in various image-related areas, such as image-text conversion, photo-to-emoji conversion, face aging, new human face generation, super-resolution image conversion, and more. This paper focuses on enhancing the resolution of magnetic resonance images (MRI), which is a common method used in medical imaging. However, obtaining high-quality MRI scans often requires long waiting times and the use of lab equipment with restrictions. Additionally, there are health hazards associated with MRI radiation, resulting in lower-quality images. Super-resolution GANs (SRGANs) can potentially address this issue. Super-resolution is a method that can generate high-resolution images from lower-resolution ones. Previously, technologies such as bi-cubic interpolation, linear interpolation, and nearest neighbor interpolation were used to achieve higher resolution. However, the results obtained using the proposed SRGAN model outperform these conventional methods in terms of performance},

  abstract={Group decision-making, an everyday practice ranging from simple choices to long-term investments, is influenced by the inherent ambiguity of the natural language we use as people. The ambiguity in this instance stands in stark contrast to the precision of language employed by machines. Furthermore, expressing emotions, such as aggressiveness or happiness, in natural language can pose a problem by influencing the group decision-making process. To address this challenge, we propose a consensus method for group decision-making that, through sentiment analysis, assesses aggressiveness in comments using generative artificial intelligence, specifically the large language models provided by Google. Using a Gemini API, we compute the degree of hostility in the comments, adjusting the weight of each expert. This ensures that more aggressive experts have less influence on the decision-making process. In such a way, this tool is able not only to encourage more objective language but also to prevent experts from unduly influencing others through their comments.},

  abstract={Artificial neural networks aspire to mimic human intelligence by constantly learning from a series of tasks without forgetting past knowledge. The most typical way to achieve this kind of learning is to store previously learned task data and replay previously stored data when training a new task. However, the performance of these methods will be affected with the reduction of memory during training. To solve this problem, a new generative replay algorithm is proposed in this paper —— A generative replay method based on the fusion of random gating and attention mechanism. This method is used to generate visual significance features for the model to remember past sample information. First, we introduce an attention mechanism into the generated model to address the issue of the quality of the generated replay data. This mechanism enhances the data salience of feature information during large-scale model training and allows the generated replay network to produce visual salience features, which essentially mimic the way a human observes. Secondly, because of the overfitting phenomenon in the training process of the model, a random gating mechanism is introduced to improve the generalization of the model and improve the accuracy of the model. Finally, we use the CIFAR100 and Permuted MNIST datasets to validate the efficacy of our method.},

  abstract={Diabetic retinopathy is a major cause of vision loss globally, and its early detection contributes to preventing complications. In this context, an architectural framework is proposed for retinal image generation in diabetic retinopathy. The generated images are subjected to a systematic clinical validation process conducted by ophthalmologists to assess their alignment with the clinical manifestations of diabetic retinopathy and enhance their applicability in pathology analysis. The dataset used for training, testing, and validating the generative model must possess an adequate volume and a balanced class distribution. High visual quality and accurate representation of the morphological features specific to each stage of diabetic retinopathy are fundamental elements for achieving the targeted outcomes. The developed architecture enables the synthesis of highly realistic retinal representations, supporting both the training of diagnostic models and the investigation of disease progression through generative artificial intelligence.},

  abstract={Motion deblurring is challenging due to the fast movements of the object or the camera itself. Existing methods usually try to liberate it by training CNN model or Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN). However, their methods can’t restore the details very well. In this paper, a Deblurring Transformer based on Generative Adversarial Network(DTransGAN) is proposed to improve the deblurring performance of the vehicles under the surveillance camera scene. The proposed DTransGAN combines the low-level information and the high-level information through skip connection, which saves the original information of the image as much as possible to restore the details. Besides, we replace the convolution layer in the generator with the swin transformer block, which could pay more attention to the reconstruction of details. Finally, we create the vehicle motion blur dataset. It contains two parts, namely the clear image and the corresponding blurry image. Experiments on public datasets and the collected dataset report that DTransGAN achieves the state-of-the-art for motion deblurring task.},

  abstract={Deep learning techniques are increasingly adept at distinguishing between human-written and AI-generated text. This study presents a deep learning-based text classification system to discern the source of text—whether it’s generated by AI or authored by a human. We compiled a comprehensive and diverse dataset incorporating existing datasets, real-time tweets, and synthetic data generated by cutting-edge AI models such as Google Bard and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Seven deep learning techniques including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and Bidirectional RNN (BiRNN) and four text embedding techniques namely One-hot, Word2Vec, TF-IDF, and BERT, are employed to perform 28 experiments (4*7). Our findings exhibit outstanding performance across all models. BERT-based models notably outshine the others, with BERT-CNN achieving the highest accuracy of 98.87%, an MCC of 0.9742, and an F1 measure of 0.9916. Following closely, Bert-BiLSTM attained an accuracy, MCC, and F1 score of 98.77%, 0.9720, and 0.9909, respectively. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning approaches in distinguishing between human and AI-generated text, with potential applications in automated content moderation, detection of AI-generated spam, and safeguarding the authenticity of user-generated content.},

  abstract={In the rapidly evolving world of generative artificial intelligence (AI), it is crucial to exercise our human capacity for critical analysis of that technology. The CRAiEDL STEAM Collective brings together emerging artists, engineers, ethicists, academics, and makers to leverage art as a unique lens to critically examine technology and (re)evaluate its meaning and function in the world. In this paper, we report on our experiences using STEAM and research-creation methodologies in a pilot study that produced two critical artworks co-created with generative AI tools: "Calibrating Stretched Transparency", which explores biases inherent to decision-making tools used in large-scale technopolitical climate projects, and "I’m Honoured To Serve", which examines the seductive design of digital environments that generate user data for profit. This pilot research project demonstrated the value and effectiveness of using art and research-creation in a STEAM context to critically examine the rapidly evolving world of technology, including generative AI, and the role of arts and humanities in responsible AI innovation. The overall project resulted in a reconfiguring of each member’s understanding of the potential for STEAM to transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries to produce a new type of expertise (i.e., STEAM expertise) and new knowledge (e.g., a critical STEAM-informed perspective on voice-based AI assistants, in the case of "I’m Honoured To Serve").},

  abstract={Fault diagnosis of rolling bearing has always been a vital component in industrial field, and effective fault diagnostic methods can guarantee normal progress of manufacturing production. However, the scarcity of fault samples in practical scenarios is still a vexed question, which will seriously affect the accuracy of data-driven diagnostic methods. For the settlement of above problem, this paper introduces a supervised generation model CGAN (Conditional Generative Adversarial Network) to generate multitudinal fault data, and replaces the real fault data with the generated one to constitute a new dataset to train the classifiers adequately. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the experiments are carried out on both artificial dataset and real one. The results show that the generated data of CGAN not only has a high degree of similarity with the real data, but also effectively improves the fault diagnosis accuracy of rolling bearing.},

During the training process, the generative strategy network utilizes images collected from the agent in four directions to generate the agent-centered top view. Concurrently, the coordinative strategy network uses both the first-person view and the agent-centered top view as inputs to determine the corresponding actions. In the evaluation phase, images of the generated agent-centered top view and first-person view are input to the coordinative strategy network, which relies solely on internally collected images for strategic decision-making. Our method achieves coordination by seamlessly integrating local and global information, utilizing a distinctive combination of neural network architectures. This approach successfully addresses the multiagent coordination challenge without the need for direct communication in diverse and complex environments.},

There has been a research area dedicated to game content generation. More recently, Generative tasks have been in charge of a wide range of content creations that are relevant to games. Although some front-line Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are used independently, others are used in conjunction with more traditional techniques or an intel-ligent environment. GANs model suffers from a problem known as mode collapse where duplicate content is generated. In this ar-ticle, we have applied a simple Generative Adversarial Network, Deep convolutional Generative Adversarial Network(DCGAN), and Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network(WGAN) to the ZELDA data set for levels of content generation and conclude the results of the basis of visual recognition.

  abstract={Within the next decade, the need for automation, intelligent data handling and pre-processing is expected to increase in order to cope with the vast amount of information generated by a heavily connected and digitalised world. Over the past decades, modern computer networks, infrastructures and digital devices have grown in both complexity and interconnectivity. Cyber security personnel protecting these assets have been confronted with increasing attack surfaces and advancing attack patterns. In order to manage this, cyber defence methods began to rely on automation and (artificial) intelligence supporting the work of humans. However, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) supported methods have not only been integrated in network monitoring and endpoint security products but are almost omnipresent in any application involving constant monitoring, complex or large volumes of data. Intelligent IDS, automated cyber defence, network monitoring and surveillance as well as secure software development and orchestration are all examples of assets that are reliant on ML and automation. These applications are of considerable interest to malicious actors due to their importance to society. Furthermore, ML and AI methods are also used in audio-visual systems utilised by digital assistants, autonomous vehicles, face-recognition applications and many others. Successful attack vectors targeting the AI of audio-visual systems have already been reported. These attacks range from requiring little technical knowledge to complex attacks hijacking the underlying AI.With the increasing dependence of society on ML and AI, we must prepare for the next generation of cyber attacks being directed against these areas. Attacking a system through its learning and automation methods allows attackers to severely damage the system, while at the same time allowing them to operate covertly. The combination of being inherently hidden through the manipulation made, its devastating impact and the wide unawareness of AI and ML vulnerabilities make attack vectors against AI and ML highly favourable for malicious operators. Furthermore, AI systems tend to be difficult to analyse post-incident as well as to monitor during operations. Discriminating a compromised from an uncompromised AI in real-time is still considered difficult.In this paper, we report on the state of the art of attack patterns directed against AI and ML methods. We derive and discuss the attack surface of prominent learning mechanisms utilised in AI systems. We conclude with an analysis of the implications of AI and ML attacks for the next decade of cyber conflicts as well as mitigations strategies and their limitations.},

  abstract={As image generators based on diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) become widely accessible and user-friendly, it is crucial to explore the impact of AI-generated artworks. These creations, which rival traditional works, spark debates about authenticity and legal recognition. Advocates highlight creativity, while skeptics question human authorship. The boundary between AI and traditional art remains contentious, affecting issues of attribution and ownership. In our pilot study, individuals were asked (n = 45) to choose between handmade artworks, co-designed pieces, and text-prompt-generated images. Additionally, participants were inquired whether they could identify AI-generated images (n=30). Our findings reveal that while individuals can often distinguish AI-generated art (accuracy=70.37%), this does not impact their preference.},

  pages={1988-1992},
  abstract={Generative adversarial network (GAN) has recently demonstrated a powerful tool for infrared and visible image fusion. However, existing methods extract the features incompletely, miss some textures, and lack the stability of training. To cope with these issues, this article proposes a novel image fusion Laplacian pyramid GAN (IF-LapGAN). Firstly, a generator is constructed which consists of shallow features extraction module, Laplacian pyramid module, and reconstruction module. Specifically, the Laplacian pyramid module is a pyramid-style encoder-decoder architecture, which progressively extracts the multi-scale features. Moreover, the attention module is equipped in the decoder to effectively decode the salient features. Then, two discriminators are adopted to discriminate the fused image and two different modalities respectively. To improve the stability of adversarial learning, we propose to develop another side supervised loss based on the side pre-trained fusion network. Extensive experiments show that IF-LapGAN achieves 3.27%, 27.28%, 6.32%, 1.39%, 3.14%, 1.15% and 1.07% improvement gains in terms of $Q_{NMI}$, $Q_{M}$, $Q_{Yang}$, $Q^{AB/F}$, MI, VIF, and FMI, respectively, compared with the second best values.},

  abstract={Mobile social networking (MSN) is gaining significant popularity owing to location-based services (LBS) and personalized services. This direct location sharing increases the risk of infringing the user’s location privacy. In order to protect the location privacy of users, many studies on generating synthetic trajectory data using generative adversarial networks (GANs) are being conducted. However, GAN generates limited synthesis trajectory data due to mode collapse problem. In this paper, we propose a trajectory category auxiliary classifier-GAN (TCAC-GAN) that generates synthetic trajectory data with improved utility and anonymity by reducing mode collapse using ACGAN. In experiments, the performance of utility and anonymity of TCAC-GAN is compared with LSTM-TrajGAN.},

  abstract={Irreversible vision loss, generally insidious in start and lacking apparent symptoms, is usually attributed to glaucoma. Detecting glaucoma in its early stages is crucial since it may reduce disease progression. Conventional diagnostic approaches, depending on manual assessments, are notably prone to mistakes. Hence, automated glaucoma analysis acquires vital relevance for precise and prompt detection. Moreover, medical picture databases frequently display asymmetries, creating a problem. To solve these challenges, this paper presents a unique framework employing generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate images, thus addressing dataset imbalances. Specifically., in the context of fundus images, standard approaches like image-to-image translation are applied to build synthetic fundus images and associated vascular networks, attempting to boost overall image quality and capture finer details. Gaussian filtering is originally done to pre-process the raw dataset, eliminating unwanted noise. Subsequently, GANs are applied for dataset balancing, providing synthetic images that boost classification accuracy. Optic cup segmentation is conducted using the Enhanced Level Set Algorithm. Finally, Pretrained MobileNetV2 permits accurate classification of glaucomatous images into normal and pathological categories. Experimental results illustrate the efficacy of our suggested framework, obtaining an accuracy of 98.9%, exceeding existing techniques.},

  abstract={Restoring damaged Dunhuang murals, a vital aspect of preserving cultural heritage, requires methods that effectively address both global structural recovery and fine-grained detail reconstruction. Traditional restoration approaches are labor-intensive and limited in precision, while recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), offer new possibilities for automated and accurate restoration. In this work, we propose a novel GAN-based framework tailored for mural restoration, incorporating the Residual Large Kernel Convolutional (RLKConv) block as a core architectural component. It combines large kernel convolutions with depthwise and pointwise operations, enabling the model to capture global contextual information while preserving fine details. Additionally, the residual connections ensure stable training and efficient feature refinement. The proposed framework demonstrates superior performance in reconstructing missing or degraded mural regions, achieving high visual fidelity and structural consistency.},

Visual eavesdropping techniques, such as “Shoulder Surfing,” pose significant threats to security, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and identity theft, whereby sensitive information is illicitly obtained during user input. This paper introduces a novel method designed to fortify password security, simultaneously enhancing the user experience and facilitating secure transactions. The proposed methodology introduces a personalized interactive password selection process that not only increases user engagement but also bolsters security measures. User-entered prompts undergo processing to transform into personalized tokens and form a secure password. These tokens are utilized to generate foundational images in which the tokens are strategically allocated ensuring both clarity and randomness. The system employs machine learning algorithm, particularly focusing on deep learning approaches for image analysis and pattern recognition techniques to verify user-entered passwords against stored data. Successful authentication triggers secure transactions, providing a seamless and protected user experience.},

  abstract={Cyberattacks on cloud computing have increased dramatically in recent years due to the technology's central role in today's digital infrastructure. The scattered and ever-changing nature of cloud systems makes it difficult for traditional security measures to identify and counteract sophisticated attackers. With an emphasis on their capacity to identify, avert, and react to cyber dangers in real-time, this study investigates the use of AI and ML technologies to improve cloud security. By analyzing massive databases for trends, predicting harmful actions, and mitigating assaults before they do harm, AI-powered solutions provide an adaptable, automated method to cloud security. Cloud security features including intrusion detection, anomaly detection, and threat intelligence are among those studied in this research, along with supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning machine learning models. Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered systems may swiftly and accurately identify sophisticated multi-vector cyberattacks, zero-day attacks, insider threats, and other forms of cybercrime by examining network traffic, user behavior, and system vulnerabilities. Data privacy, scalability, and the possibility of adversarial assaults on AI models are some of the issues that this study resolves as they pertain to cloud AI integration. The practical benefits of cloud security solutions powered by AI are demonstrated through case studies from areas like e-commerce, healthcare, and finance. Improving the interpretability of AI models, making them more scalable, and making sure they comply with regulations so they may be used more widely are all topics covered in the paper's discussion of future research directions.},

  abstract={As Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tools become increasingly integrated into digital workflows, ensuring the usability of such automation before deployment on live systems is critical. This paper introduces a novel sandbox environment implemented within a virtual machine designed to safely test AI-driven task automation in isolation. The study evaluates user interactions with automated systems through two distinct feedback modalities: direct mouse control and text-based input, across tasks of varying difficulty levels (easy, medium, and hard) through measuring System Usability Scale, task completion rate and NASA TLX. The experiment introduces two primary independent variables: interaction modality and task difficulty. Interaction modality is categorized into direct mouse control by the user versus providing guidance to the AI through a chat interface. Task difficulty is divided into three levels-easy, medium, and hard; each presented sequentially to participants within their assigned interaction modality. A field experiment with 28 participants revealed that direct mouse control outperformed text-based feedback in task completion rates (83.3% vs. 61.9%) and usability. However, as task difficulty increased, user workload also rose significantly, regardless of the feedback modality. Qualitative analysis highlighted common barriers to effective interaction, such as delayed AI responses and frustration with error correction responsiveness. The study aims to identify patterns in user-AI collaboration dynamics, pinpoint challenges in the AI's autonomous decision-making, and assess the efficacy of the intervention methods. The findings are expected to inform the design of future human-centered AI systems that can effectively balance autonomy with user oversight in complex environments.},

  abstract={The rapid proliferation of generative and predictive AI tools has introduced a new and largely unregulated phenomenon: Shadow AI—the unsanctioned, informal use of artificial intelligence technologies within organisations. This paper conceptualises Shadow AI as a distinct sociotechnical challenge, emerging at the intersection of digital innovation, organisational culture, and governance failure. Through a multi-layered analysis, we develop a typology of Shadow AI use cases, propose a risk classification framework, and explore diverse stakeholder perspectives on its implications. Drawing on anonymised case studies from sectors including healthcare, finance, defence, and education, we demonstrate how Shadow AI introduces systemic vulnerabilities that are poorly addressed by conventional cybersecurity or compliance frameworks. The paper concludes by offering a set of actionable recommendations for organisations, policymakers, and educators, and outlines two forward-looking research agendas focused on secure AI deployment and cyber statecraft. By framing Shadow AI as both a risk and a signal of latent demand, this paper calls for an adaptive, ethically grounded approach to AI governance—one that balances innovation with resilience in an era of decentralised technology use.},

  abstract={Inspecting electric utility assets is vital for ensuring the electricity supply's reliability, availability, and sustainability. Traditionally, these inspections have relied on labor-intensive methods such as foot patrols and helicopter-assisted surveys, which are slow and costly and pose significant safety risks. However, with advancements in technology, particularly in ar-tificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), there has been a significant shift towards automating these inspections. Integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced imaging sensors and deep learning algorithms has shown great potential for improving the efficiency and accuracy of power line inspections. Despite these advancements, significant challenges remain in achieving comprehensive automated power line inspections. Recent developments in generative and zero-shot learning AI models offer promising opportunities to address these challenges and expedite the development of automated inspection techniques across a wide range of power line inspection use cases. This paper reviews the power line inspection process and highlights the use of deep learning computer vision techniques and existing challenges. We explore some future opportunities to leverage the latest developments in multimodal large language models and zero-shot learning for defect detection, segmentation, and synthetic data generation.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},

  pages={1-10},
  abstract={Perceptual encryption methods are the key enablers for protecting image privacy for deep learning-based applications in the cloud. In perceptual encryption, the image content is obfuscated such that the deep learning models can work on the obfuscated data. The key advantage of perceptual encryption over holomorphic encryption is that, unlike holomorphic encryption, the feature required by the target deep learning model is preserved in the encrypted data. Therefore, the model is not required to be retrained on the encrypted data. Recently, a significant number of perceptual encryption methods have been proposed in the literature, each improving over the others. In this paper, we perform a detailed security analysis of three best-known perceptual encryption methods, namely, Adversarial Visual Information Hiding, Learnable Encryption, and Encryption-then-Compression methods designed to protect the privacy of images. We proposed a new GAN-based security evaluation framework to successfully reconstruct the original images encrypted by these methods, showing clear security flaws. We conducted extensive experiments using different datasets and deep learning models. The results show significant vulnerabilities in the existing key-based perceptual encryption methods. The source code of our work is available at the given link: https://github.com/umesh-21/Benchmark to perceptual encryption.},

  volume={11},

  pages={1172-1179},
  abstract={With the introduction of CycleGAN, there have been significant advancements in the task of biphasic face photo-sketch synthesis (FPSS). To further enhance the results in this task, most methods have focused on optimizing the model without attempting to exploit the additional information inherent in the face itself. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel Face Semantic-Aware CycleGAN (FSACycleGAN) for bidirectional face photo-to-sketch synthesis. Firstly, a method is introduced to inject facial semantic distribution images into the generator, providing additional spatial and identity supervision for the synthesized face photos and sketches. Furthermore, facial semantic information is incorporated into the loss function along with identity differences in generated images, aiding in preserving facial details and identity information in the generated face photos and sketches. Lastly, a novel cyclic adversarial training strategy is proposed. It involves introducing an additional recognition model, enabling a cycle of adversarial training between the recognition and generation models to optimize the generated results. Through extensive training on the CUFS dataset, the results demonstrate that the proposed method has achieved significant improvements compared to CycleGAN. Specifically, it has shown a 16.3% improvement in SSIM and a 5.5% improvement in FSIM. The accuracy in sketch matching and photo matching tasks reached 99.42% and 98.64%, respectively, showcasing excellent performance.},

This paper introduces a novel system for generating visual citations within AI-generated images, thereby addressing copyright concerns while fostering ethical use and sharing of digital art. The proposed system aims to efficiently identify elements and styles that are possibly derived from existing artworks within the outputs of text-to-image AI systems. This system enhances privacy and security as it operates on image features and embeddings, rather than accessing the images directly, thus avoiding the handling of copyrighted materials. The system automatically embeds metadata into the images, detailing the origins of the included artistic elements. Moreover, the system enhances compliance by enabling automatic or manual modifications of generation prompts, ensuring that generated images are free of copyright infringements. This functionality not only protects artists' intellectual property but also supports transparent acknowledgment in digital media creation. The proposed system has the potential to facilitate respectful interactions between AI technologies and creative content.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is becoming a disruptive force in education worldwide, providing creative answers for curriculum development, institutional management, and personalized learning. Given Zimbabwe's limited infrastructure, changing regulatory frameworks, and low level of digital readiness, integrating GenAI offers both enormous potential and difficult obstacles. The potential of GenAI to transform Zimbabwe's educational system is examined in this study, which focuses on a cooperative investigation carried out by scholars from several faculties at a single university in the country. A thorough literature review serves as the foundation for the study, which is also enhanced by interdisciplinary academic perspectives from the fields of management, computer science, education, and the social sciences. The mixed methods approach used allowed for a thorough investigation of the applications of GenAI, institutional preparedness, ethical issues, and policy ramifications. The use of GenAI to improve teaching strategies, automate tests, and boost administrative effectiveness is becoming more popular, according to key findings. The study does, however, also emphasise the necessity of national AI policy development, capacity building for ethical AI deployment, and strategic investment in digital infrastructure. Policymakers, researchers, university administrators, and practitioners of educational technology are the target audience for this paper.

  abstract={The advent of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), exemplified by ChatGPT, has introduced both new opportunities and challenges in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and entrepreneurship education. This exploratory quasi-experimental study examined the effects of ChatGPT-assisted collaborative learning (CCL) on students’ learning performance, artificial intelligence (AI) awareness, critical thinking, and cognitive load. A total of 36 sophomore undergraduates participated in an eight-week instructional experiment, dedicating 3 h per week to applying STEM and entrepreneurship knowledge in the creation of cultural products. The experimental group (N = 21) participated in CCL, while the control group (N = 15) engaged in non-ChatGPT-assisted collaborative learning (NCCL). The results indicated that the CCL group outperformed the NCCL group in terms of learning performance, AI awareness, and cognitive load, while the NCCL group excelled in critical thinking. The findings confirm that ChatGPT offers significant potential and advantages in addressing complex problems within group collaboration and stimulating group creativity, providing new insights into fostering students’ entrepreneurial spirit and skills. However, overreliance on and misuse of ChatGPT may hinder student learning outcomes. Future research should focus on the cocreative problem-solving mechanisms between humans and machines in entrepreneurial education, particularly the interplay of knowledge, thinking, emotions, and actions in collaborative processes involving GAI.},

  abstract={Locomotion can be a result of coordination of movements between well-shaped limbs of an organism, or it can be an emerging effect of local interactions between several simple agents forming an aggregated swarm that can move around in the environment. In this paper, we apply a distributed morphogenesis approach to develop a mobile growing artificial organism. The morphogenesis approach works based on a competition between several agents at growing positions that strive to get larger fractions of a limited shared resource needed for growth. The morphology develops from the local competitions and interactions of such agents with each other and with their environment. The locomotion driven by this approach is the result of growing new agents at one side and retracting agents from the other side of the overall swarm-based organism. The morphogenesis controller is successfully evolved here for generating a growing organism that moves towards a target.},

Artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the emergence of systems that help ascertain and classify dermal images, improving traditional clinical evaluation and proving valuable where skilled labor is scarce. Its implementation requires patient genetic and cultural diversity, as well as evaluating efficacy, safety, and ethical issues. Skin cancer diagnosis requires high accuracy for effective treatment. This paper investigates how generative AI can be used to improve diagnosis and classification.

Traditional machine learning-based automated FDD model demonstrates a high classification accuracy with sufficient training data samples, however, suffers from physical interpretation of the machine learning models. In this article, a physical model integrated Wasserstain generative adversarial network (WGAN) model is presented for AHU FDD with a scenario of insufficient training data samples. The proposed solution tackles the real-world problem of AHU FDD and enhances the model interpretability significantly. A transformer-WGAN model is designed to further improve the proposed FDD framework. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing AHU FDD methods with imbalanced real-world training data samples.},

  abstract={Identifying an appropriate fault threshold is a challenging task in the context of anomaly detection and requires a significant amount of expert knowledge. The use of modern technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), can facilitate the identification of an optimal threshold for a given data set during the training phase. At the beginning of a drive's operational life, only normal samples are available for training purposes. Furthermore, the data available for training can be used to distinguish between normal and abnormal conditions, with performance depending on the degree of fault. This is because the threshold depends on the samples that are most similar to the normal state. The proposed methodology uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) for anomaly detection. During the training phase, the GAN was trained using samples from the normal state. In the subsequent application phase, only the discriminator was used to detect faulty states. It is not necessary to provide a sophisticated interpretation of an anomaly score. The method was evaluated in two case studies. The first case study is the detection of bearing faults and the second is the detection of commutator surface faults using synthetic data. Both studies achieved near error-free prediction using both the Case Western Reverse University (CWRU) bearing data set and an own bearing data set. In addition, this work provides some heuristics for the training process, so that no faulty data were needed to evaluate the training performance.},

This state-of-the-art literature review examines the evolution of the prompt phenomenon, focusing on key developments such as the Transformer model and ChatGPT. By analyzing the growth in related research publications from the Scopus database across three periods—pre-Transformer (1967–2016), post-Transformer (2017–2021), and post-ChatGPT (2022-2024)—this study highlights the exponential growth of prompt engineering as a critical area of AI research. The findings reveal how prompt engineering has evolved from a basic computational concept into a recognized engineering discipline, with implications for both technical and social sciences. The review also proposes future research directions, including the exploration of non-linear prompting and prompt-oriented behavior engineering, to further enhance human-AI interactions and optimize generative AI systems.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly permeating various industries, yet significant gaps remain in workforce readiness, training, and adoption practices. These gaps create heightened risks around bias, security, and ethical implications. While AI safety frameworks exist, many focus primarily on technical measures and omit the broader human-centric needs and challenges employees face when integrating AI into daily workflows. This paper addresses these concerns by proposing a conceptual framework that emphasizes stakeholder needs analysis, interdisciplinary education and experiential learning programs, certification, and policy guidance to foster responsible AI (RAI) practices. The framework moves beyond mere technical compliance to include robust guardrails, ethical awareness, and practical engagement strategies designed to mitigate the risks of misinformation, hate, privacy breaches, and inadvertent harm. By outlining how organizations can embed this comprehensive approach to AI safety into their operations, the framework aims to equip employees with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate AI's rapidly evolving capabilities responsibly. We present both the framework itself and preliminary results from its application in the context of Generative AI, illustrating how workforce development can be systematically aligned with RAI principles for safer, more effective AI adoption.},

Image processing is the primary approach for banknote identification, and deep learning, with neural networks being the most important aspect, in big data processing. The study examined banknotes from several nations and suggested a deep learning-based system to identify fake notes using Deep learning model, therefore reducing the financial harm that fake currency may bring to individuals. The study evaluates deep learning algorithm’sability to distinguish between authentic and fraudulent notes and groups them according to fidelity. The efficiency number is based on how well the system recognizes phony notes. Since the algorithm’s accuracy is probably the best, money authentication is a useful tool that help banks to identify fake notes.},

  abstract={Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based dehazing methods have achieved great success in single image dehazing. However, the absence of real-world haze image datasets hinders the deep development of single image dehazing. To address this issue, we propose a diverse hazy image synthesis method based on generative adversarial network (GAN) and matting. Specially, we train a GAN-based model that can transform a gray image into a hazy image. To boost the diversity of hazy images, we propose to simulate hazy images via image matting, which can fuse a real haze image with another image containing diverse objects. To evaluate the performance of dehazing methods, we propose two novel metrics: part-based peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structure similarity index measure (SSIM). Extensive experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed model, dataset, and criteria.},

  abstract={In this paper, we introduce “Comment Compass,” a novel system designed to revolutionize the analysis of YouTube video comments by content creators. The hypothesis driving this research is that integrating web scraping, sentiment analysis, and generative AI can provide content creators with deeper insights into their audience's sentiments and perspectives, thereby enhancing content strategy and engagement. Methodologically, “Comment Compass” employs Python-based web scraping to extract comments from YouTube videos. Sentiment analysis is conducted using the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library, which produces a pie chart depicting the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral comments. Additionally, the system leverages Generative models to generate further insights from the comments, such as future content ideas, criticisms, and inquiries. Our results indicate that “Comment Compass” offers content creators actionable insights that can significantly optimize content strategies for better audience engagement and impact. This work demonstrates the substantial potential of combining web scraping, sentiment analysis, and generative AI, contributing valuable knowledge to these fields. The findings are contextualized within existing literature, underscoring the innovative contributions of this research.},

  pages={131-139},
  abstract={Outlier detection is an important data mining task, and developing effective methods to detect outliers is challenging in cases where there is insufficient labeled data. Manually labeling the data is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Because of a limited number of labeled samples, the classes are unbalanced, resulting in a class-imbalance problem. Existing methods fail to address these aforementioned issues holistically and fall short in generating quality outlier samples for effective outlier detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new solution that tackles these problems. We propose a. Generative Adversarial Active Learning method (DIR-GAAL), which generates Diverse, Informative, and Representative outlier samples through active learning, and employs the mini-max game between the generator and discriminator in a generative adversarial network. We conducted extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of our method. When compared to other benchmark methods, our method consistently demon-strates better outlier detection accuracy without being negatively affected by the class-imbalance problem.},

  abstract={Due to the influence of factors such as weather and geography, renewable energy generation has a high level of uncertainty, which poses challenges to the stability and optimization of the power grid operation. Therefore, accurately describing this uncertainty becomes a crucial problem that needs to be addressed urgently. This article proposes a method for wind power scenario generation based on the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP). This method is model-free and data-driven. Compared to traditional probabilistic modeling approaches, WGAN-GP has higher operability, higher efficiency, and better results in generating wind power scenarios. In addition, we designed a Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) model for wind power scenario classification. We trained the BPNN model using real wind power data from the NREL dataset. Finally, we compared the generated wind power scenarios with the real data to validate the accuracy of the WGAN-GP model in generating wind power scenarios.},

  abstract={Accurate and continuous monitoring of heart rate and rhythm is crucial for the diagnosis and management of various cardiovascular diseases. Traditional 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) provide comprehensive information about cardiac electrical activity but require multiple electrodes and wired connections, limiting their use in ambulatory settings. To address these limitations, we explored the possibility of synthesizing a complete 3-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) from a single available lead using a generative adversarial network (GAN). The GAN is designed to learn the anatomical and physiological relationships between different leads, capturing specific features of ECG signals. The generator architecture is adapted to account for anatomical differences, incorporating modules specific to each lead. Medical constraints are integrated into the training process to ensure physiological coherence in the generated signals. This innovative approach allows for detailed insights into cardiac electrical activity from a single measurement point, offering a practical and precise solution for advanced cardiac monitoring. The findings of this research open up new possibilities in the field of remote medical monitoring and cardiac disorder management.},

However, the generation of such a metaverse environment requires significant investment with the creation of simple prototypes taking an extended duration. Although there are generative artificial intelligencebased methods to create small scenes, there is an absence of a method to do so for industrial applications. We devised a platform to create railway environments with the assistance of the language models for code creation and semantic inference without the need for reprogramming or editing of the project source meaning environments could be generated by the end users. With a natural language input and a coding paradigm output the code generation module is shown together with the example environments from real-life railway lines in Tokyo, Japan as preliminary results. By creating such environments leveraging the rapid generation with the help of generative artificial intelligence, we show generative artificial intelligence can be used to automate the task of the programmer to create new environments on demand from the user in natural language.},

  abstract={Automated decision-making has become a critical field in artificial intelligence, addressing complex challenges in autonomous driving, finance, healthcare, and industrial applications. Traditional decision-making systems often struggle with issues such as data scarcity, environmental unpredictability, and the high costs of real-world testing. These limitations hinder the development of robust and adaptive decision-making frameworks, particularly in dynamic and high-stakes scenarios.To address these challenges, this study integrates deep generative models with reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance automated decision-making. Generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), create realistic synthetic data and simulate diverse scenarios, providing RL agents with enriched training environments. Meanwhile, RL enables adaptive decision strategies through continuous interaction with these simulated environments. This synergy overcomes traditional bottlenecks by improving data availability, training efficiency, and adaptability to real-world complexities. The innovation of this research lies in its hybrid framework, which combines the strengths of generative models and RL to address challenges in data-scarce, high-uncertainty environments. The proposed approach not only accelerates learning and enhances robustness but also paves the way for applications requiring ethical, safe, and transparent decisionmaking.},

Most of the digital education systems and tools only focus on curriculum delivery and fail to address the emotional states of students and their individual learning capabilities, this leads to the downfall of their academic progress and will yield poor learning outcomes. To address this issue, we have developed a system that analyzes the emotional states of students and then further categorizes them according to their learning pace (fast, medium, or slow). Our system works by first analyzing the survey responses collected from students using a scoring system that is predefined. Then it generates a personalized lesson plan tailored for each student according to the insights gained from the responses. With the integration of OpenAI's GPT-3 for the Lesson plan generation we ensure the content generated will be tailored specifically for each student's needs. Furthermore, it has been observed that using learning strategies that use AI-driven technology can create a more supportive and flexible educational environment which results in the student having better comprehension, motivation and increases academic success.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={1-4},
  abstract={Generating realistic fake faces has been a subject of significant interest in the fields of computer vision and artificial intelligence. Recent advancements in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have led to substantial progress in synthesizing visually appealing and highly convincing synthetic faces. In this paper, the focus is on the use of GANs to generate fake faces. The GAN approach includes training a generator model using a set of random vectors drawn from a Gaussian distribution to produce synthetic images. Initially, the generated images may not resemble the real input distribution. To address this, a discriminator model is trained using batches of real and fake images to learn to differentiate between them. Subsequently, the generator’s output is fed through the discriminator to obtain output probabilities. These probabilities are compared with the desired probability (usually 1 for generated images), and the resulting error is used to update the generator’s weights through backpropagation. This iterative process continues until the generated images closely resemble the input distribution. The objective of this research paper is to comprehensively explore the capabilities of GANs in generating fake faces. It provides an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art techniques and their implications. By studying the effectiveness and limitations of GAN-based fake face generation, this research aims to contribute to the broader understanding of this field.},

  abstract={Aiming at the network security problems faced by resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) edge devices, this paper proposes an intrusion detection method based on balancing generative adversarial network, namely BAGAN-BD, which uses BAGAN-BD for data enhancement to balance the data distribution, so as to solve the problem that highly unbalanced data will affect the classification detection performance. BAGAN-BD firstly inherits the prior knowledge of the autoencoder with tag embedding, then adopts a multi-generator structure to generate different types of attack data, adds a classifier structure, uses Focal Loss to calculate classification losses, and finally introduces gradient penalty technology to solve the problems of GAN training instability and mode collapse. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 97.54% macro average accuracy, 96.90% recall rate and 97.19% F1 score in classification tasks on UNSWNB15 dataset, all of which are higher than the comparison model.},

  abstract={In today’s society, robotics systems are being widely adopted in various fields of human activity. Robots not only play a decisive role in modern intelligent industries, but are also crucial to industrial production as a whole. The use of robotic devices is increasing in the field of unmanned transport, the gaming industry and ubiquitous systems. Parallel to the processes of robotisation, there is a lag in robot behaviour relative to human intelligence. Most robotics (numerically controlled machine tool based manufacturing) operates based on rigidly-defined algorithms and is not capable of generalising experience and making decisions in a human-like manner. This paper proposes a control system architecture for a robotic device based on an generative approach. This paper deals with the problem of controlling the motion of a robot. As a solution to the problem, a deep model like generative adversarial approach is proposed for generating motion control commands. The proposed architecture of intelligent control system and methods of generating control commands can be generalized to control systems of more complex robotic complexes and technological processes.},

  abstract={This article presents the progress in the development of a generative algorithm to support the synthesis of periodic metasurfaces. The proposed model corresponds to a conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (cDCGAN) to solve the backward design problem for absorptive metasurfaces. To build the training dataset, three canonical shapes were simulated in the 50-80 GHz band. The algorithm was fed with absorption spectra and additional conditions to render an image with a proposed geometry. We demonstrate that the rendered designs produce absorption profiles similar to the ground truth from the validation set, in terms of shape and absorbance. Also, the conditioning of the DCGAN works with high accuracy level. These results are promising though there is room for improvement by extending our training dataset and by delivering an operational forward network and optimization pipeline.},

  abstract={In the rapidly evolving landscape of education, the concept of Education 5.0 emerges as a transformative paradigm that integrates personalized learning, sustainable development, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and advanced technologies. How can educational institutions integrate AI and advanced technologies in the framework of Education 5.0 and Global Strategic Leadership to enhance personalized learning, promote sustainable development goals (SDGs), and facilitate innovative solutions in dynamic educational environments? This study investigates the case of the postgraduate course “Strategic Leadership in the Global Context,” where the Horizons Architecture method was applied with AI and advanced technologies to identify Education 5.0 components that foster innovative learning environments. The research employed the case study method, with the key components of Education 5.0: competencies, method, technology, infrastructure, stakeholders, and sustainability. The study population included managers, directors, and business leaders. The results indicated that (a) personalized learning links to shared goals for sustainable development; (b) Horizon scanning facilitates the search for solutions for all stakeholders; (c) the strategic integration of AI and advanced technologies enhances personalized learning experiences; (d) strategic leadership fosters agility and open innovation; and (e) collaborative partnerships drive sustainable educational transformations. This research provides a differentiated perspective for educational communities, society at large, and policymakers by illuminating pathways to navigate the complexities of Education 5.0. It underscores the imperative of proactive leadership and strategic foresight to shape future-ready educational ecosystems.},

  abstract={Machine learning is expected to play an important role in implementing automotive systems such as the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). To make machine learning methods work well, providing a sufficient number of training data is very important. However, collecting the training data may be difficult or very timing-consuming. In this paper we investigate automatic generation of training data for automotive applications. The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) techniques are employed to generate fake yet still high-quality data for machine learning. Although using GAN to generate training images has been proposed in the literature, the previous work does not consider automotive applications. In this work a case study on vehicle detection is provided to demonstrate powerfulness of GAN and the effectiveness of the generated training images by GAN. The generated fake bus images are employed as training data and a SVM (Support Vector Machine) method is implemented to detect buses. The results show that the SVM trained by the fake images achieves almost the same detection accuracy as that by real images. The result also shows that GAN can generate the training images very fast. The extension of GAN to generate road images with various weather conditions such as fogs or nights is also discussed.},

  abstract={genai and communication networks are expected to have groundbreaking synergies for 6G. Connecting Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) agents via a wireless network can potentially unleash the power of Collective Intelligence (CI) and pave the way for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, current wireless networks are designed as a “data pipe” and are not suited to accommodate and leverage the power of GenAI. In this paper, we propose the GenAINet framework in which distributed GenAI agents communicate knowledge (facts, experiences, and methods) to accomplish arbitrary tasks. We first propose an architecture for a single GenAI agent and then provide a network architecture integrating GenAI capabilities to manage both network protocols and applications. Building on this, we investigate effective communication and reasoning problems by proposing a semantic-native GenAINet. Specifically, GenAI agents extract semantics from heterogeneous raw data, build and maintain a knowledge model representing the semantic relationships among pieces of knowledge, which is retrieved by GenAI models for planning and reasoning. Under this paradigm, different levels of collaboration can be achieved flexibly depending on the complexity of targeted tasks. Furthermore, we conduct two case studies in which, through wireless device queries, we demonstrate that extracting, compressing and transferring common knowledge can improve query accuracy while reducing communication costs; and in the wireless power control problem, we show that distributed agents can complete general tasks independently through collaborative reasoning without predefined communication protocols. Finally, we discuss challenges and future research directions in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) in 6G networks.},
