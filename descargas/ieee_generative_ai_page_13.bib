  abstract={CycleGAN, a type of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), is used in this study to tackle the difficult problem of translating cityscape photographs between day and night settings. Day-to-night picture translation is changing well-lit daytime images into nocturnal landscapes using artificial lighting, unique color palettes, and atmospheric effects, and vice versa. Previously, this work required labour-intensive manual involvement or specialised picture algorithms, but deep learning and GANs have introduced automation and better quality to this industry. CycleGAN excels at unpaired picture translation, even when there are no obvious correspondences between daylight and nighttime datasets. It makes use of the idea of cycle consistency to ensure proper translation between picture domains. This study focuses on training a CycleGAN model and found encouraging results. Beyond technical aspects, this paper highlights practical applications spanning film production, gaming, urban planning, traffic management, photography, environmental impact assessment, and more. CycleGAN's adaptability offers opportunities to enhance realism, aesthetics, and decision-making across various domains. In summary, this research underscores the potential of CycleGAN in day-to-night image translation, unlocking new possibilities in visualizing urban environments and influencing diverse industries and applications.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Rapid malware evolution calls for the creation of novel, imaginative techniques that enhance the accuracy and resilience of traditional detection methods. Here, a hybrid strategy focused on malware detection will be proposed, where GANs and transfer learning are employed to improve the accuracy and resilience of image representations. Converting malware binaries into grayscale images may change how visual features are used to identify specific patterns that could define malware and eventually determine classification. GANs are used to generate artificial malware samples, which enhance the dataset with a variety of adversarial examples that closely mimic the diversity of actual malware. The model is therefore more resistant to deceptive infection techniques. Convolutional neural network pre-training enables transfer learning and saves resources for lengthy training from scratch and decreases the strain of training. As was previously said, the GAN-generative adversarial examples feature a wider variety of malware types that enhance its capacity to identify new threats precisely. Opposing the traditional approach, the experimental findings showed that this hybrid strategy improved the detection accuracy and decreased the rate of false positives. The reason for this is its adaptability and scalability, which qualify it for real-time malware detection.},

  abstract={This paper presents an innovative approach for evaluating and improving the robustness of deep learning models against adversarial attacks for image datasets. In this framework, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are proposed for synthetic image generation, and Denoising Autoencoders (DAEs) are used for noise removal. An adversarial training pipeline is used to generate adversarial examples and analyze the effect of these examples on model performance. A discriminator network is used for adversarial sample detection and classifying samples, whereas the autoencoder is used to minimize reconstruction errors by means of a robust image recovering algorithm. The evaluation contains metrics for an adversarial sample detection and reconstruction accuracy, thereby providing insight into the robustness or sometimes defense of ML models under adversarial conditions. The results indicate that this is able to detect adversarial influences on the models and mitigate them evidently, thus forming one step towards forming secure AI systems.},

  abstract={Augmented Reality (AR) technologies have been utilized for interior design for years. Normally 3D furniture models need to be created manually or by scanning with specialized devices and this is usually a costly process. Additionally, users need controllers or hands for manipulating the virtual furniture which may lead to fatigue for long-time usage. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have made it possible to generate 3D models from texts, images or both and show potential to automate interactions through the user’s voice. We propose a novel design, AICRID in short, which aims to automate the 3D model generation and to facilitate the interactions for interior design AR by leveraging on AI technologies. Specifically, our design will allow the users to directly generate 3D furniture models with generative AI, enabling them to directly interact with the virtual objects through their voices.},

  abstract={In the rapidly evolving domain of cloud computing and cybersecurity, staying ahead of threats requires proactive and adaptive solutions. This paper introduces an end-to-end framework designed to enhance cloud security through automated attack generation, execution, and defense enhancement. The framework consists of four main components: the Database, the Generator, the Executor, and the Defender. The database comprises extensive data sources, including attack logs and security reports. The Generator utilizes the environment and system specifications to generate both traditional and zero-day attack vectors. The Executor classifies attacks, assigns them to specialized workers for execution, and consolidates the results into a comprehensive report. The Defender then analyzes this report to iteratively enhance the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). This iterative process enhances the system’s resilience and robustness to future, unknown threats. The framework is adaptable, allowing customization to meet the security needs of various organizations making it well-suited for applications such as enterprise cloud security, cybersecurity education, and beyond. Future work will focus on building a simplified version of the system, which will later be expanded into a scalable architecture capable of addressing more intricate attack scenarios.},

  abstract={ChatBot technology has become a widely used in various application fields. An important topic in the research on conversational robots is the improvement of their temperature during operation for enhanced user interaction. In this study, we propose an artificial intelligence affective conversational robot (AIACR), which is an integration of an artificial intelligence deep learning sentiment analysis model and generative-and retrieval-based dialogue models. The sentiment analysis model developed in this study uses three models, namely, multilayer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM). Moreover, word2vec and semantics are utilized as the basis for similarity ranking models. The deep learning dialogue model, sentiment analysis model, and similarity model were integrated and compared as well. The experimental results show that the sentiment analysis model, similarity model, and dialogue model respectively utilize BiLSTM, word2vec, and the retrieval-based model to achieve the best dialogue performance. The major research contributions of this study are the developed AIACR and the proposed affective conversational robot index (ACR Index) as a criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of emotional dialogue robots.},

  abstract={In this research, we investigate the influence of utilizing artificial intelligence (AI)-generated photographs on malicious bots that engage in disinformation, fraud, reputation manipulation, and other types of malicious activity on social networks. Our research aims to compare the performance metrics of social bots that employ AI photos with those that use other types of photographs. To accomplish this, we analyzed a dataset with 13 748 measurements of 11 423 bots from the VK social network and identified 73 cases where bots employed generative adversarial network (GAN)-photos and 84 cases where bots employed diffusion or transformers photos. We conducted a qualitative comparison of these bots using metrics such as price, survival rate, quality, speed, and human trust. Our study findings indicate that bots that use AI-photos exhibit less danger and lower levels of sophistication compared to other types: AI-enhanced bots are less expensive, less popular on exchange platforms, of inferior quality, less likely to be operated by humans, and, as a consequence, faster and more susceptible to being blocked by social networks. We also did not observe any significant difference between GAN-based and diffusion/transformers-based bots, indicating that diffusion/transformers models did not contribute to increased bot sophistication compared to GAN models. Our contributions include a proposed methodology for evaluating the impact of photos on bot sophistication, along with a publicly available dataset for other researchers to study and analyze bots. Our research findings suggest a contradiction to theoretical expectations: in practice, bots using AI-generated photos pose less danger.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has shown great potential to assist in the creation of picture books. The fairy tale of The Little Match Girl was adapted in this study to explore the application of GAI in “story creation” and “illustration creation” by combining human creativity and AI generation technology to produce a six-page picture book. Furthermore, the performance of AI and a human in the process of the adaption was compared and analyzed. During story creating stage, the researcher of this study employed ChatGPT to generate story structure and creative elements. ChatGPT had a great accomplishment of condensing and narrating stories, but its adjustment on emotional tones required human interventions to achieve the desired effect. Although there were several modifications prior to the ultimate ending to “war” and “tragedy” requested by the researcher, ChatGPT did still show excellent creative potential. When creating illustrations, the researcher used ChatGPT to generate commands and Midjourney to generate illustrations. With character setting and costume details requiring human tweaking and integration, Midjourney excelled at color grading and atmosphere simulation, but having consistency between details and style was a challenging task for Midjourney. In the process of selecting and modifying generated content, AI tools played an important role in inciting creative ideas. The results of this study indicated that GAI was feasible to improve creation efficiency and inspire creativity; however, human intervention was still needed in details and accuracy. As an auxiliary tool, AI could effectively support artistic creation, but achieving the desired results required fine adjustment by humans. It is hoped that this study can serve as a reference direction for future artistic creation.},

  abstract={In today’s world, there is a drastic change in how tools are auto-generating content. These content generation tools that use generative AI make it easier to write blogs, generate content, reply to emails, create and publish content quickly, parse text, and refer to specific information very quickly and with ease. Students use these tools in colleges and educational institutions daily on social media. GenAI tools help reconstruct sentences, correct grammar, use proper words, auto-filling information, and preempt words that make the user not think but instead follow the prompts. GenAI will impact future generations because they cannot be self-reliant and rely heavily on artificial intelligence to form sentences and write the essential content. There must be a need for AI awareness and governance adoption in AI applications and tools as an integral process with a balance on how AI adoption in educational and social networks should enrich and promote individuals in the learning process and dynamically adjust to the individual requirements and help them in crafting sentences intelligently, build information and ideas that encourage thinking process, and using standard English conventions and expression of ideas. The primary focus of this paper is to introduce the challenges of GenAI adoption in applications and tools we use daily and its exposure to Gen X, Gen Y, Gen Z, and Gen Alpha. In this paper, we will bring awareness to such GenAI tools that can adversely impact the growth of individual cognitive thinking processes and the measures that citizens should take so that Human Intelligence prevails over Artificial Intelligence.},

  abstract={Recent advances in 3D sensor technology have advanced 3D imaging systems. This sparks interest in 3D picture feature extraction and categorization. According to the literature, textural content is essential to visuals. In this case, we extract texture characteristics from three-dimensional photos to improve feature differentiation. Category of volumetric data with texture is possible using this method. We employ feature vectors from Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix methods to achieve this. The visual pattern and volumetric data contrast, homogeneity, and local anisotropy are described. The proposed approach was tested using a publicly accessible dataset of modified volumetric textured pictures. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are classified. Our solution outperforms manually constructed techniques for extracting texture characteristics from 3D and 2D data and standard deep-learning networks. Even with few photographs per class, the recommended method improves class distinction and yields good results. Show exceptional accuracy. Integrating the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) with Local Binary Patterns (LBP) improved classification performance. The GLCM approach, which captures spatial relationships, and the LBP method, which depicts local texture, was advantageous. This hybrid method improved feature extraction and classification, notably for complex 3D medical pictures with subtle texture changes.},

  abstract={The aim of this study is to apply and characterize eXplainable AI (XAI) to assess the quality of synthetic health data generated using a data augmentation algorithm. In this exploratory study, several synthetic datasets are generated using various configurations of a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) from a set of 156 observations related to adult hearing screening. A rule-based native XAI algorithm, the Logic Learning Machine, is used in combination with conventional utility metrics. The classification performance in different conditions is assessed: models trained and tested on synthetic data, models trained on synthetic data and tested on real data, and models trained on real data and tested on synthetic data. The rules extracted from real and synthetic data are then compared using a rule similarity metric. The results indicate that XAI may be used to assess the quality of synthetic data by (i) the analysis of classification performance and (ii) the analysis of the rules extracted on real and synthetic data (number, covering, structure, cut-off values, and similarity). These results suggest that XAI can be used in an original way to assess synthetic health data and extract knowledge about the mechanisms underlying the generated data.},

  abstract={With the expansion of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the penetration of AI chatbots into every aspect of people's daily lives, discussions and issues related to AI ethics and responsibility began to arise simultaneously. A large portion of AI users remain ignorant of such ethical discussions, while a significant percentage of developers lack precautionary measures to prevent irresponsible AI behaviors. An increasing number of companies and organizations are taking action to address the problems. Despite the efforts, prominent issues still prevail. Most existing solutions are too general and theoretical; few are narrowed down to examine the specific application scenario of AI chatbots in education. In response, this study aims to address the arising concerns and the lack of a satisfying solution. After conducting an extensive literature review and performing a detailed analysis of survey data, this study develops a comprehensive guideline about AI ethics and responsible AI, which specifically targets undergraduate developers and guides them during their development of AI chatbots used in education. This guideline successfully bridges the knowledge gap, raises awareness about AI ethics, and acts as the first guideline for undergraduate students, influencing future development practices.},

  title={Hybrid Deep Learning Model Based on GAN and RESNET for Detecting Fake Faces}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={12},
  number={},
  pages={86391-86402},
  abstract={While human brains have the ability to distinguish face characteristics, the use of advanced technology and artificial intelligence blurs the difference between actual and modified images. The evolution of digital editing applications has led to the fabrication of very lifelike false faces, making it harder for humans to discriminate between real and made ones. Because of this, techniques like deep learning are being used increasingly to distinguish between real and artificial faces,producing more consistent and accurate results. In order to detect fraudulent faces, This paper introduces a pioneering hybrid deep learning model, which merges the capabilities of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and the Residual Neural Network (RESNET) architecture, aimed at detecting fake faces. By integrating GANs’ generative strength with RESNET’s discriminative abilities, the proposed model offers a novel approach to discerning real from artificial faces. Through a comparative analysis, the performance of the hybrid model is evaluated against established pre-trained models such as VGG16 and RESNET 50. Results demonstrate the superior effectiveness of the hybrid model in accurately detecting fake faces, marking a notable advancement in facial image recognition and authentication. The findings on a benchmark dataset show that the proposed model obtains outstanding performance measures, including precision 0.79, recall 0.88, F1-score 0.83, accuracy 0.83, and ROC AUC Score 0.825. The study’s conclusions highlight the hybrid model’s strong performance in identifying fake faces, especially when it comes to accuracy, precision, and memory economy. By combining the generative capacity of GANs with the discriminative capabilities of RESNET, this solves the problems caused by more complex fake face generation approaches.With significant potential for use in identity verification, social media content moderation, cybersecurity, and other areas, the study seeks to advance the field of false face identification. In these situations, being able to accurately discriminate between real and altered faces is crucial. Notably, our suggested model adds Channel-Wise Attention Mechanisms to RESNET50 at the feature extraction phase, which increases its effectiveness and boosts its overall performance.},

  abstract={Multimodal remote sensing images contain complementary information, thus, could potentially benefit many remote sensing applications. To this end, the image registration is a common requirement for utilizing the multimodal images. However, due to the rather different imaging mechanisms, multimodal image registration becomes much more challenging than ordinary registration, particular for optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In this work, we design a deep matching network to exploit the latent and coherent features between multimodal patch pairs for inferring their matching labels. But, the network requires immense data for training, which is not usually met. To address this issue, we propose a generative matching network (GMN) to generate the coupled optical and SAR images, hence, improve the quantity and diversity of the training data. The experimental results show that our proposal significantly improves the registration performance of optical and SAR image registration, and achieves subpixel or close to subpixel error.},

  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is currently one of the most popular research topics in machine learning. It mainly uses two competing networks, a generator network and a discriminator network to learn from the distribution of real samples. The complexity of the real sample distribution leads to many problems in the stability of the generative adversarial network in the training process. The Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) were introduced to solve some problem. The performance quality of the results has been significantly improved by DCGAN, but it still sometimes fails to produce realistic data.Due to the deficiencies above DCGAN, this paper involves the capsule network structure into the conditional generation adversarial network, and proposes the CapsuleCGAN (Capsule Conditional Generative Adverserial Networks) architecture. Through the experiment on the MNIST dataset, comparing CGAN and DCGAN, the results show that the proposed CapsuleCGAN architecture can be successfully trained. From the experimental results, not only the high-quality images can be generated, but also in generating maps as diversity. Finally, we put some forward suggestions and ideas for improvement in the future work.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Dataset development for machine learning (ML) is considered a challenging and time-consuming process because of the significant resources needed for preprocessing. Automated pipelines for retrieving and preprocessing large amounts of data are not always so readily available. This article examines the benefits of using self-attention ML object detection approaches in the image preprocessing stage in an autonomous manner. We focus on the case where the required preprocessing is text (noise) removal from architectural images. The model we develop is based on the state-of-the-art Text Spotting Transformer (TESTR) framework.By using our TESTR model, we demonstrate that identification and removal of unwanted text annotations on architectural floor plan image datasets are feasible. The impact of inference threshold and image scale on the removal performance is investigated. Optimal thresholds are derived between leaving text and inadvertently removing (building) content. The lower the image scale, the worse the object detection performance. Our pipeline could be used for the preprocessing of huge image datasets for removing obsolete/unwanted annotations and features to improve performance during generative adversarial network (GAN) model training.This could boost efforts to make artificial intelligence systems automatically offer suggestions and refine the building design. The application of TESTR to the architectural image data preprocessing stage as a tool for text and numerical content removal has shown promise. The recognizer decoder of TESTR provides the ability to retain the removed content information for further labeling.},

By introducing GAN's supervision mechanism, the segmented network has a better performance. We constructed a training set of 200 renal ultrasound images and a test set composed of 40 images, and carried out experiments on them.

  abstract={The process of =making an Artificial intelligent system to replicating human emotional understanding and adapt its responses contextually by tailoring its responses based on individual cognitive and emotional states is called Artificial Personalized Intelligence (API). In this paper, we present a finetuned emotionally adaptive AI pipeline capable of generating personalized, human-like responses. Using a custom dataset based on six universal emotions—Sadness, Happiness, Fear, Anger, Surprise, and Disgust—collected from interviews with 30 participants, we have explored two approaches: fine-tuning a LLaMA-3 8B model with the Low-Rank Adapter (LoRA) technique and employing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent-based framework over the same LLaMA-3 8B model. Emotion classification, prompt engineering, and model fine-tuning were used over the dataset to capture emotional and personalized subtleties in the responses based on different individuals. We conducted a comprehensive analysis, evaluating performance across candidates, emotions, and overall performance, using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient to measure the difference among the outputs from both pipelines and actual human emotional responses. Our results show that prompt engineering combined with LoRA-based fine-tuning significantly enhances the ability to engage in emotionally intelligent and personalized conversations, whereas the RAG-based approach underperformed due to the pretrained LLAMA-3 model’s restrictive neutral and adversarial training. This highlights that fine-tuned LLMs are effective in replicating human emotions for personalized intelligence.},

It has been found that the AI-driven animation production process can assist humans in automating the process, speeding up the production of works, maintaining artistic expression to a certain extent, and providing new ideas for creating animation. However, with the popularity of AI technology comes some potential risks and challenges, including content homogenization, technology misuse and copyright attribution. By analyzing examples of current AI practices in animation production, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the practical application of AI technology in animation creation. It presents preliminary suggestions for addressing these risks.

  abstract={Protein subcellular localization (PSCL) prediction is a key research area in bioinformatics. However, most existing models have ignored the homology and diversity among protein sequences, which can reveal the functional sequence segments and indirectly reflect the structure of the protein. Consequently, the achieved performance is limited. To break through this limitation, we propose an end-to-end deep learning model for PSCL prediction, namely, MSADeepLoc. In this model, the protein features are extracted by a protein language model, the MSA Transformer. The MSA Transformer can learn the evolutionary conservation and variability among protein sequences from extensive multiple sequence alignments, effectively capturing and refining key biological information within the sequence structure. Additionally, we apply a pre-trained Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to solve the data imbalance issue. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed MSADeepLoc outperforms the state-of-the-art models in the task of PSCL prediction.},

  abstract={Nowadays, generative models with deep learning have a focus and give enormous success in various real-time experience domains. Deep learning (DL) is a subdivision of machine learning that is inspired by the structure and function of human brain activity, known as artificial neural networks. It is a data-driven technique that achieves the best accuracy while using a large number of input samples. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a robust class of neural networks used for unsupervised learning under DL categories. GAN is one of the most influential architectures demonstrating remarkable success in generating high-quality data. The reusable feature learning process from a huge number of unlabelled data paves the way for research. This survey article discusses an overview of the GAN model, such as the original GAN, Conditional GANs, and resolution GANs, along with their specific adaptations for various tasks. Additionally, we examine the situations faced by Generative Adversarial Networks depending on various applications such as image and video generation, medical image analysis, text-to-image synthesis, agriculture, and creative industries such as music and art. This survey explores diverse applications of recently developed frameworks and benchmark datasets used for development, along with their architecture and metric evaluations.},

  abstract={Recently, with increasing interest in pet healthcare, the demand for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems in veterinary medicine has increased. The development of veterinary CAD has stagnated due to a lack of sufficient radiology data. To overcome the challenge, we propose a generative active learning framework based on a variational autoencoder. This approach aims to alleviate the scarcity of reliable data for CAD systems in veterinary medicine. This study utilizes datasets comprising cardiomegaly radiographic image data and chronic kidney disease ultrasound image data. After removing annotations and standardizing images, we employed a framework for data augmentation, which consists of a data generation phase and a query phase for filtering the generated data. The experimental results revealed that as the data generated through this framework was added to the training data of the generative model, the frechet inception distance decreased from 84.14 to 50.75 in the radiographic image and from 127.98 to 35.16 in an ultrasound image. Subsequently, when the generated data were incorporated into the training of the classification model, the true negative of the confusion matrix also improved from 0.16 to 0.66 on the radiograph and from 0.44 to 0.64 on the ultrasound image. The proposed framework has the potential to address the challenges of data scarcity in medical CAD, contributing to its advancement.},

  abstract={Traditional teaching methods in Indian schools often lack engaging elements, hindering students’ full comprehension of concepts and fostering a tendency to memorize rather than understand. Existing solutions fail to provide effective visualization-based interactive learning. To address these issues, we propose an interactive application-based solution utilizing generative AI image generation models that can be used by students and teachers. Our application employs interactive story generation, allowing students to prompt creative texts and gain a deeper understanding of concepts. Trained on the school curriculum, this tool facilitates self-study, empowering students to understand complex topics independently. The application extends to classroom use, enabling teachers to incorporate interactive and application-based learning alongside traditional methods. Leveraging Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) and transformer-based models, the system analyses user input, extracts key elements, and creates dynamic story graphs for engaging narrative experiences. The integration of quantum computing enhances the application's capabilities, providing a novel approach to education through dynamic storytelling.In conclusion, the proposed solution seeks to bridge the gap in traditional teaching methods by introducing an innovative and interactive approach to education using Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks. This holistic solution addresses the limitations of current educational practices, offering a transformative learning experience for students and teachers alike.},

  abstract={In order to stabilize the training of generative adversarial networks, several recent works advocate spectral normalization in the discriminator. However, the method ignores the influence of the generator, and the quality of the images generated in practice is unstable. We propose L2 norm regularization in the generator based on the spectral normalization, which can solve the above shortcomings. Our method directly makes the generated data close to real data in Euclidean space, and indirectly helps the spectral normalization achieve tighter Lipschitz constraint during the training of generative adversarial networks. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 dataset confirm that our method can not only stable the quality of the images generated by spectral normalization, but also improve the quality of generated images.},

Creating online content that the search engines can easily read and that Google ranks highly costs less than running paid advertising online. The practice of crafting website content to make it search engine friendly is called search engine optimization, which is a critical part of the digital marketing playbook. This chapter discusses why and how users are changing the way that they use search engines, what that change means for marketing, and how businesses can adapt their strategies for this change. The use of search generative experience opens up many possibilities for personalized search experiences.

  abstract={The ocean contains many resources that are vital to the sustainable development of human society. Underwater images provide an important way for people to understand the underwater environment of the ocean. However, due to the uneven medium in water and the scattering effects of light, underwater images usually suffer from some severe degradation problems, such as color distortion and blurring. As such, underwater image enhancement is a very important and critical task in detection of underwater marine objects. To circumvent these problems, a novel generative adversarial network for underwater image enhancement is proposed. In the proposed method, the generator makes use of U-Net network structure and combines CBAM and ASPP to ensure effectiveness of multi-scale feature extraction. The discriminator employs a double-branch structure to guide the generator to generate images from global semantics to local details and enhance local details of the images. Finally, in the quantitative and qualitative analysis, the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art methods. Comparative studies demonstrate that our proposed method is better than other methods.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) utilizes existing data to create new forms of content, including text, images, and audio. One valuable application of generative AI in an IT Enabled Services (ITES) company is the development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) by processing and consolidating existing SOPs through a Large Language Model. This paper explores how generative AI can generate content within standardized templates, improve the language of SOPs, and make them suitable for specific industries and processes, such as the pharmaceutical procure-to-pay process. It also addresses version control, helps users maintain consistency and compliance, extracts knowledge for onboarding, and provides interactive training on SOPs through Questions and Answers. The proposed workflow employs Azure OpenAI's GPT-3.5 turbo for generating responses, which are evaluated using Tonic Validate Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) metrics. Furthermore, the paper introduces Prompt Compression approaches and selects one prompt compression approach to streamline the context retrieved for large language models while preserving the semantic meaning of the outputs. It also details strategies for reducing API call costs by over 10% for prompts of varying token sizes, ensuring high-quality responses from the GPT-3.5 turbo model according to RAG metrics. These criteria of accuracy, precision and cost reduction are considered to recommend the prompt compression approach for Large Language Models used in development of Standard Operating Procedures.},

However, the swift progression of AI also presents new sustainability challenges, particularly concerning its carbon footprint and resource consumption. To explore the complex research landscape at the intersection of AI and sustainability, this study utilized topic modeling on research papers in the field. Using an AI-based topic modeling tool, 4,541 research abstracts published from 2015 to 2024 were processed. This approach identified 67 distinct topics, each characterized by unique keywords and associated publications. The findings illustrate a consistent expansion in research areas and a significant recent surge in publications, particularly in topics such as ‘Large Language Models’ and ‘Generative Art and Design.’ By organizing topics into the quadrants of a BCG-like matrix considering both topic size and growth, the study offers balanced insights into the dynamic landscape of the field. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering was applied to the 67 topics to reveal the interrelationships among them and identify broader and major research themes. This study advances our understanding of the relationship between AI and sustainability by highlighting both established and emerging areas of research and elucidating the evolving nature of the field.},

  abstract={Architectural design is a multifaceted process that traditionally requires extensive time and expertise, often leading to inefficiencies and prolonged project timelines. This study explores the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically an optimized CycleGAN, to address these challenges by integrating architectural style transfer and classification into a single, end-to-end model. The model is trained on a diverse dataset comprising modern and traditional architectural styles, enabling it to transform modern architectural images into traditional styles while simultaneously categorizing the architectural style of each input. The results indicate that the model effectively generates traditional architectural styles from modern inputs, capturing key stylistic elements such as texture and form. However, the classification module reveals an imbalance in performance, with higher accuracy and lower loss for traditional style compared to modern style, suggesting areas for improvement. The findings underscore the potential of AI in revolutionizing architectural design, offering a more efficient, accurate, and streamlined process that can significantly enhance the precision and speed of architectural projects. This study contributes to the growing body of research on AI in architecture, demonstrating its applicability in real-world design scenarios.},

  abstract={Kuwait's rapid urban expansion, driven by large-scale projects, such as AI-Mutlaa City and Silk City, highlights the need for comprehensive geotechnical data to support sustainable development. However, detailed studies on the subsurface geotechnical characteristics of the northern regions of Kuwait are lacking. This study focuses on establishing a preliminary geotechnical database, addressing challenges encountered during its development, and conducting a pilot analysis for AI-Mutlaa City. A questionnaire was distributed to geology, environmental, geotechnical, and engineering professionals to identify the challenges associated with creating the database. The survey revealed issues such as inconsistent data formats, limited access to borehole logs, and the hesitancy of private firms to share data due to security concerns. Despite these challenges, borehole data from ministries and private organizations were collected and organized using Microsoft Excel. These data formed the foundation of the geotechnical database, which was analyzed and visualized using Geographic Information System (GIS) tools. The pilot study in AI-Mutlaa City revealed predominantly dense soil layers, with significant variations in soil strength at a depth of 19.5 m, where standard penetration resistance ranged from 10 to 50 blows. These findings emphasize the variability of soil properties in the area and underscore the importance of site-specific investigations. The established geotechnical database provides valuable insights for construction planning, risk assessment, and geohazard management. Moving forward, the integration of artificial intelligence into the database is planned to enhance data processing, automate soil classification, and predict subsurface conditions in an effort to contribute to advanced geotechnical practices in Kuwait.},

  abstract={Facial recognition system in computer vision is widely used in human-computer interface and clinical diagnostics. Nonetheless, achieving high accuracy in this task still poses a challenge due to issues of inadequate amount and imbalance of data to train the models as well as issues of generalization and robustness. The findings of this research propose the use of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) data augmentation for face emotion classification specifically for this approach. The proposed strategy is based on the generation of artificial ‘emotional’ images on the face using Deep Neural Self Attention GANs (DNSAGANs). This way, to capture all the variations of facial expressions the GAN takes a large number of images and thus makes the augmented data richer and more realistic. This larger data set is then used to train a deep learning architecture that performs the face emotion classification thereby enabling the network to learn enhanced discriminative features. To collect face photos the FER2013 dataset is used. The training process, entrained the generator and discriminator to minimize the mean squared error while the discriminator was simultaneously trained to robustly distinguish generated images from real ones. Altogether, the proposed Adam optimizer was more accurate than Adagrad and Adadelta for all epochs. The percentage of accuracy is about $88.64 \%$ for 100 epochs using the proposed optimizer techniques.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (AI) provides changes to higher education, which has attracted widespread attention from researchers and educators. However, the existing research has not comprehensively examined how university teachers perceive the use of generative AI for student assessment and what strategies should be implemented when applying this technology in China. This study employed mixed-method research to explore teachers’ perceptions of student assessment using generative AI. We collected data through interviews and surveys from Chinese universities. Our findings demonstrate that a majority of teachers agreed with the power of AI tools to enhance the overall quality of the evaluation and their work efficiency, since they can alleviate the burden associated with manual grading and offer prompt feedback. University teachers expect to prepare their knowledge and skills for the usage of new technologies through training programs and professional development opportunities. Besides, this study notes some concerns like data security and privacy fairness, biases inherent in AI algorithms, overreliance on automation, and limited critical human thinking. These challenges lead to the need for further explorations to provide holistic feedback and balance the AI assessment approach with human judgment to meet reasonable standards. This study provides a general introduction to AI-assisted assessment transformation in the university setting, and more empirical inquiries on different types, phases, objectives, and strategies of assessment in practices are suggested.},

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) could be a remedy. Within an MoE, different experts handle distinct input features, producing unique expert routing patterns for various classes in a routing feature space. As a result, unknown class samples may display different expert routing patterns to known classes. This paper proposes Dual-Space Detection, which exploits the inconsistencies between the image feature space and the routing feature space to detect unknown class samples without any threshold. A Graph Router is further introduced to better make use of the spatial information among the image patches. Experiments on three datasets validated the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.},

  abstract={The integration of smart medical technologies and connected applications into the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is revolutionizing healthcare by optimizing patient connectivity, immediate monitoring, and data mining. However, the openness of IoMT networks exposes these systems to a variety of cyber threats. These attacks jeopardize the protection, availability, and accuracy of sensitive information and associated resources. It is therefore essential to strengthen the security of IoMT infrastructures in the face of these malicious activities. Identifying new attacks in these environments is a major challenge for researchers and industry professionals. This paper analyzes machine learning-based strategies for identifying IoMT intrusions. We conduct a comprehensive examination of existing solutions, focusing on the analytical methodologies employed, the datasets utilized, and the effectiveness of detection performance. In addition, we discuss the challenges and considerations involved in designing high-performance systems capable of detecting cyberattacks targeting the IoMT. Finally, we highlight future prospects for the development of advanced protection mechanisms tailored to connected medical infrastructures.},

  pages={313-326},
  abstract={The fundus image is often used in clinical diagnosis due to ease and safety of acquisition, but the quality may be affected by environment and onsite operations. As low-quality medical images may lead to misinterpretation in diagnosis and analysis, it is important to improve quality of the improperly-acquired fundus images. Unfortunately, the existing fundus image enhancement methods require task-specific prior knowledge or suffer from insufficient generalization ability. To cope with this issue, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based model is proposed, namely the semi-supervised GAN with anatomical structure preservation (SSGAN-ASP). Specifically, an anatomical structure extraction component is employed in the generator to guide the enhancement process by preserving both retinal and lesion structures, while color information in the fundus image is also preserved. The SSGAN-ASP model is evaluated and compared with the state-of-the-art methods for medical image enhancement on three popular datasets. In addition, it is applied in the pre-processing of retinal vessel segmentation and diabetic retinopathy grading tasks to show efficacy in computer-aided diagnosis. Experimental results demonstrate that visual quality of the enhanced image can be improved while better performance in clinical diagnosis is achieved with our proposed model by adopting the anatomical structure extraction component and preserving color information as well.},

  abstract={This study analyzes how ChatGPT, a generative artificial intelligence tool, reproduces gender stereotypes when creating educational case studies. Through a qualitative analysis of 50 cases, variables such as gender, character role, educational level, position held, and socioeconomic level were examined. The results show that women are more frequently represented in problematic roles, with lower levels of education and in low-ranking positions, while men predominate in problem-solving roles, with postgraduate studies and in leadership positions. These findings underscore the risk of AI perpetuating gender biases present in the data with which it was trained. The study highlights the importance of a critical and conscious use of AI in education to avoid the reproduction of inequalities and promote a more equitable representation of gender in the content generated.},

  title={Evaluating Accuracy and Efficiency of Fruit Image Generation Using Generative AI Diffusion Models for Agricultural Robotics}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The automation of fruit picking using robotic systems is rapidly advancing within precision agriculture, relying heavily on the accurate detection and segmentation of fruit objects through computer vision. This study explores the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to create extensive fruit image datasets, concentrating on cherries, bananas, oranges, apples, and pineapples. Five generative models—Stable Diffusion v1.4, Stable Diffusion v1.5, Stable Diffusion v2, Stable Diffusion XL Refiner 1.0, and SDXL Turbo—were employed to generate 1000 images per fruit type, each set against a white background. Thresholding techniques were used to automatically extract fruit boundaries, which were then utilized to train segmentation models. The performance of these models was evaluated based on their accuracy and processing speed. SDXL Turbo consistently delivered the highest accuracy across all fruit types, though it required more processing time per image. Stable Diffusion XL Refiner 1.0 also exhibited strong accuracy but balanced performance differently. In contrast, Stable Diffusion v2 showed significant shortcomings, particularly in producing accurate images for cherries and oranges. This comparative analysis highlights the potential of advanced generative models in enhancing synthetic dataset creation for fruit object detection and segmentation in agricultural robotics. Future research will focus on refining these models to improve accuracy, broaden their applicability to a wider variety of fruits and environments, and optimize the trade-off between image quality and generation speed to meet the practical needs of agricultural automation.},

  year={2022},
  volume={10},
  number={},
  pages={34613-34624},
  abstract={We investigated 12 years DNS query logs of our campus network and identified phenomena of malicious botnet domain generation algorithm (DGA) traffic. DGA-based botnets are difficult to detect using cyber threat intelligence (CTI) systems based on blocklists. Artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML)-based CTI systems are required. This study (1) proposed a model to detect DGA-based traffic based on statistical features with datasets comprising 55 DGA families, (2) discussed how CTI can be expanded with computable CTI paradigm, and (3) described how to improve the explainability of the model outputs by blending explainable AI (XAI) and open-source intelligence (OSINT) for trust problems, an antidote for skepticism to the shared models and preventing automation bias. We define the XAI-OSINT blending as aggregations of OSINT for AI/ML model outcome validation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our models (96.3% accuracy). Our random forest model provides better robustness against three state-of-the-art DGA adversarial attacks (CharBot, DeepDGA, MaskDGA) compared with character-based deep learning models (Endgame, CMU, NYU, MIT). We demonstrate the sharing mechanism and confirm that the XAI-OSINT blending improves trust for CTI sharing as evidence to validate our proposed computable CTI paradigm to assist security analysts in security operations centers using an automated, explainable OSINT approach (for second opinion). Therefore, the computable CTI reduces manual intervention in critical cybersecurity decision-making.},

  abstract={Semantic image inpainting is different from traditional methods. Although traditional image inpainting methods can achieve good results, they ignore the context, which makes the inpainting images look less natural. Semantic image inpainting does better in this aspect. In this paper, we propose a new method about semantic image inpainting by improving the model of Generative Adversarial Networks. The generator of our network model refers to Boundary Equilibrium Generative Adversarial Networks and adds spectral normalization to improving unstable training. Then, our network chooses discriminator of Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Networks which is more concise. After training, the network model is limited to generate image encoding by context loss and prior loss to make it as similar as possible to the missing image encoding. Then, the generated images encoding corresponding to the without missing parts of the real images are obtained. After fusing the generated missing parts with the unmissed parts of the real image, it is the inpainting image. By the comparisons of vision and quantization, it shows that our method can well complete the task of large missing regions.},

  pages={135034-135058},
  abstract={Intelligent vehicle technology has made tremendous progress due to Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. Accurate behavior prediction of surrounding traffic actors is essential for the safe and secure navigation of the intelligent vehicle. Minor misbehavior of these vehicles on the busy roads may lead to an accident. Due to this, there is a need for vehicle behavior research work in today’s era. This research article reviews traffic actors’ behavior prediction techniques for intelligent vehicles to perceive, infer, and anticipate other vehicles’ intentions and future actions. It identifies the key strategies and methods for AI, emerging trends, datasets, and ongoing research issues in these fields. As per the authors’ knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review dedicated to the vehicle behavior study examining existing academic literature published by peer review venues between 2011 and 2021. A systematic review was undertaken to examine these papers, and five primary research questions have been addressed. The findings show that using sophisticated input representation that includes traffic rules and road geometry, artificial intelligence-based solutions applied to behavior prediction of traffic actors for intelligent vehicles have shown promising success, particularly in complex driving scenarios. Finally, the paper summarizes the most widely used approaches in behavior prediction of traffic actors for intelligent vehicles, which the authors believe serves as a foundation for future research in behavior prediction of surrounding traffic actors for secure and accurate intelligent vehicle navigation.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Spatial intelligence is important in many fields, such as Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC), Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), and Medicine. Understanding three-dimensional (3D) spatial rotations can involve verbal descriptions and visual or interactive examples, illustrating how objects move and change orientation in 3D space. Recent studies show that artificial intelligence (AI) with language and vision capabilities still faces limitations in spatial reasoning. In this paper, we have studied the spatial capabilities of advanced generative AI to understand the rotations of objects in 3D space utilizing its image processing and language processing features. We examined the spatial intelligence of three generative AI models (GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Llama 3.2) to understand the spatial rotation process with spatial rotation diagrams based on the revised Purdue Spatial Visualization Test: Visualization of Rotations (Revised PSVT:R). Furthermore, we incorporated an added layer of a coordinate system axes on Revised PSVT:R to study the variations in generative AI models' performance. We additionally examined generative AI models' understanding of 3D rotations in Augmented Reality (AR) scene images that visualize spatial rotations of a physical object in 3D space and observed an increased accuracy of generative AI models' understanding of rotations by adding additional textual information depicting the rotation process or mathematical representations of the rotation (e.g., matrices) superimposed on the object. The results indicate that while GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Llama 3.2 as the main current generative AI model lack the understanding of a spatial rotation process, it has the potential to understand the rotation process with additional information that can be provided by methods such as AR. AR can superimpose textual information or mathematical representations of rotations on spatial transformation diagrams and create a more intelligible input for AI to comprehend or for training AI's spatial intelligence. Furthermore, by combining the potentials in spatial intelligence of AI with AR's interactive visualization abilities, we expect to offer enhanced guidance for students' spatial learning activities. Such spatial guidance can greatly benefit understanding spatial transformations and additionally support processes like assembly, construction, manufacturing, as well as learning in AEC, STEM, and Medicine that require precise 3D spatial understanding.},

The assessment of factors like performance expectancy, effort expectancy, anthropomorphic traits, intrinsic motivation, social influence, and emotions are crucial to understanding users' readiness to adopt such software. To interpret users' acceptance levels during interactions with generative AI chatbot software, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology Model and Cognitive Appraisal Theory serve as theoretical frameworks. The model was empirically validated using data from an online survey. The analysis of generative AI software acceptance, along with the factors influencing users' willingness to use it, was conducted using PLS-SEM. The results highlighted that emotions are a significant determinant of software acceptance and support the proposed three-tier appraisal model for accepting the use of Generative AI Software.},

  abstract={This article examines the intricate relationship between humans and text-to-image generative models (generative artificial intelligence/genAI) in the realm of art. The article frames that relationship in the theory of mediated action—a well-established theory that conceptualizes how tools shape human thoughts and actions. The article describes genAI systems as learning, cocreating, and communicating, multimodally capable hybrid systems that distill and rely on the wisdom and creativity of massive crowds of people and can sometimes surpass them. Those systems elude the theoretical description of the role of tools and locus of control in mediated action. The article asks how well the theory can accommodate both the transformative potential of genAI tools in creative fields and art, and the ethics of the emergent social dynamics it generates. The article concludes by discussing the fundamental changes and broader implications that genAI brings to the realm of mediated action and, ultimately, to the very fabric of our daily lives.},

  abstract={The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) models is driven and shaped by training data. In industries where data is naturally sparse, AI systems face a significant challenge due to their intensive data needs. Anxieties about underprivileged groups' present and future healthcare AI bias stem from the difficulty of curating training data in the healthcare industry. To reduce reliance on huge data, built an autoencoder to augment and expand intentionally sparse datasets, as detailed in this paper. A computational investigation using publicly available data. Patients' ages ranging from 45 to 75 from Africa, Europe, India, and Bangladesh were included in six open-source datasets. The presented architecture uses actual patient imaging data to create synthetic pictures. For this case study, they utilised an autoencoder to augment existing public datasets of optic disc images for training purposes and assessed how well these datasets could train AI models to identify glaucomatous optic neuropathy. An evaluation of the glaucoma detector's performance was conducted using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Better detection performance is indicated by a higher AUC. The results demonstrate that by supplementing datasets with autoencoder-generated synthetic pictures, better training sets were produced, ultimately leading to enhanced AI model performance. Beyond health care, this study may boost AI adoption in all data-challenged domains, which is a major concern due to the ever-increasing database volume as well as necessary for AI building.},

  abstract={Summary <p>The aim of this chapter is to delve not into the technicalities of AI but rather into the broader mindset, rules, and attitudes surrounding it. In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI, the legalities surrounding intellectual property (IP) rights are in constant flux. The matter of IP rights for AI&#x2010;generated content is intricate and varies across jurisdictions and terms of use. Bias, an unwelcome specter, can insidiously creep into generative AI models through myriad avenues. One of the most prevalent culprits is biased training data. The chapter discusses the social implications of biased AI&#x2010;generated data on real&#x2010;world applications. It also explores the misinformation and misuse of generative AI. While some nations are proactively drafting guidelines and laws that address AI ethics, transparency, and accountability, the swift evolution of AI often eclipses the pace of these regulatory endeavors, leading to potential oversight voids.</p>},

  abstract={Recent advancements in adversarial machine learning underscore the need for robust defenses against sophisticated attacks that compromise AI systems’ reliability. Existing frameworks, such as AI Guardian, offer valuable defenses but often rely on assumptions that can limit their effectiveness, such as incorporating adversarial examples into training data and expecting attacks to be directional. This paper introduces an innovative approach to adversarial defense that diverges from traditional methods by proposing a defense strategy based on stable diffusion[1], [2]. Our method avoids training with adversarial examples and instead leverages continuous learning and comprehensive threat modeling to build inherently resilient AI systems. By addressing the limitations of existing defenses and emphasizing a dynamic, adaptive strategy, our approach aims to provide a more generalized and robust solution to adversarial threats. We present the theoretical underpinnings, experimental design, and anticipated benefits of our approach, with a focus on enhancing AI security and adaptability against unpredictable adversarial attacks[3], [4].},

  abstract={Efficient base station (BS) deployment in dense urban environments requires rapid and accurate coverage evaluation. Traditional ray-tracing, although precise, is too computationally intensive for real-time or large-scale planning. In this paper, we introduce the Base Station Coverage Strength Map (BSCSM), a novel spatial metric that quantifies deployment suitability for each location at full spatial resolution. We propose an end-to-end conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) framework that predicts BSCSM directly from building layout images, eliminating the need for expensive per-location simulations. Compared to conventional U-Net and Pix2Pix baselines, our model achieves inference speeds several orders of magnitude faster than ray-tracing, while maintaining superior TopK hotspot prediction accuracy. The generated BSCSM enable advanced 6G network planning, UAV path optimization, and real-time connectivity assessment, providing a scalable and practical solution for next-generation wireless infrastructure design.},

To manage SAGIN’s inherent complexity, artificial intelligence (AI) provides essential control capabilities, driving enhanced automation and flexibility. Despite this, there remains a significant research gap concerning the interaction between AI and SAGIN. In this context, we first present a promising approach for developing a generalized AI model capable of executing multiple tasks simultaneously in SAGIN. Subsequently, we propose a framework that leverages software-defined networking (SDN) and AI technologies to manage the resources and services across the entire SAGIN.

  pages={415-420},
  abstract={In recent years, the thriving growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has placed significant focus on deep learning (DL), a pivotal research domain. DL heavily relies on extensive, high-quality data to fuel its model learning and optimization processes, particularly achieving remarkable advancements in classification tasks. However, in practical applications, obtaining labeled data often faces many challenges, leading to limitations in the size of the dataset. When there is insufficient data, DL models are prone to overfitting, which is particularly prominent when dealing with small-scale datasets. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fixed dataset enhancement and classification algorithm based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This method utilizes the generation capability of GAN to generate new and diverse data samples, effectively expanding the size of the original fixed dataset and increasing its diversity. Through this approach, not only can the problem of insufficient data be alleviated, but also the performance of DL classification algorithms can be improved. The experimental results show that by introducing GAN for data augmentation, the performance of classification algorithms has been significantly improved, providing strong support for the promotion and application of DL in practical applications.},

  abstract={Since modern life dictates human comforts, it is not surprising that the revolution of the wireless technology dominated very quickly in industrial nations, which is unlike the practical world of yore when activities required extra physical efforts to be accomplished. Nowadays, physical tasks are avoided. Therefore, it is the time to lunch quick transformations in artificial material, based on nano-scale structures and metamaterial inclusions, design to accelerate the development of modern photonic devices that have suffered from several limitations such as availability, integrability, reconfigurability, immutability, and maintainability in which the material electromagnetic specifications play the major role. This paper presents a Python implementation of a Generative-Adversarial-Network (GAN) tailored for the design and optimization of metamaterials for nano-photonics devices. The GAN consists of a generator model that produces synthetic 2D nanostructure patterns and a discriminator model that distinguishes between real and generated patterns. The goal is to generate novel designs that exhibit desirable optical properties. The code leverages TensorFlow and Keras to build and train the GAN, utilizing the MNIST dataset as a placeholder for metamaterial data. In a JupyterLab environment, the code generates and visualizes the evolving designs during training. By refining the generator through adversarial training, this approach lays the groundwork for automating the design of metamaterial-based photonic devices, reducing the need for labor-intensive trial-and-error processes and enabling rapid exploration of the design space. The implementation can be adapted to incorporate physics-based simulations for evaluating optical performance, providing a robust framework for the automated discovery of next-generation metamaterials.},

  abstract={This article examines the application of generative artificial intelligence in simulating virtual tourism experiences and its impact on tourist behavior in the postCOVID era. Utilizing advanced technologies such as Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, and WebXR, a system has been designed to create interactive virtual experiences of tourist destinations. A literature review reveals that both virtual experiences and generative AI hold significant potential in the tourism industry. However, few studies have explored how these two technologies can be combined and their impact on tourist behavior. Additionally, considering that generative AI, as a tool for simulating tourism experiences, significantly influences tourists' perception of destinations and attractions, travel intention, travel anxiety, and willingness to pay, studying generative AI and virtual tourism seems essential and important. Therefore, this study aims to review previous research and explore the impact of AI-based virtual tourism experiences on tourist behavior in the post-COVID era. Moreover, the study investigates factors influencing the effectiveness of these experiences and the moderating role of safety and health concerns. Results also show that perceived realism and interactivity of virtual experiences are key factors in the effectiveness of these experiences. This research provides a theoretical framework for understanding the influence of generative AI on tourism behavior and offers important practical implications for destination marketers and policymakers in the post-COVID tourism industry.},

  abstract={A country's critical infrastructures are heavily related to the quality of life and safety of the people. As a result, the security protection aspect of critical infrastructure has gained more and more attention nowadays, especially the security of its industrial control system (ICS). To avoid the abnormal condition happening in the critical infrastructure which could put people in great danger, a system that is capable of detecting any abnormal state of the ICS promptly is needed. Fortunately, due to the dramatic growth of the applications of machine learning in recent years, some researchers have already proposed anomaly detection methods with machine learning to provide instant warning and protection for ICS. However, most of the existing anomaly detection research tends to only target one cause that harms the system, such as attacks on the network or physical equipment failures. The ICS will be more comprehensively secured if the anomaly detection system can cover multiple aspects of the ICS. Therefore, we have established a non-normal warning system with the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for dam operations in this study, which can detect various types of non-normal operations and notify relevant personnel right away. Note that we use real historical data to make predictions and verify our warning system, and we improve it even more by implementing the visual analysis method, which makes up the indecipherable results often found in unsupervised learning.},

Focusing on the response phase of flood disaster management, this study identifies the critical issues involved, including the limitations of manual observation in traditional methods and the lack of structured flood image databases. This research explores the use of generative artificial intelligence (gen-AI) to create synthetic images as an alternative source in flood disaster detection and response. By adopting a systematic approach with the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm, the model is trained on gen-AI-produced synthetic images and tested using real drone-captured images from past flood events. The model demonstrates promising preliminary results with the highest performing model, achieving a mean average precision (mAP50) of 96.7%, mAP@[0.5,0.95] of 78.7% and an F1 score of 90.8%. These findings highlight the potential of gen-AI in supporting flood disaster response efforts in Malaysia, aiming to integrate the mix of synthetic images during non-flooding periods and actual drone images during flood scenarios into the comprehensive FloodIntel framework for future research.},

  abstract={The designers' tendency to adhere to a specific mental set and heavy emotional investment in their initial ideas often limit their ability to innovate during the design ideation process. The shrinking time-to-market and the growing diversity of users' needs further exacerbate this gap. Recent advances in deep generative models have created new possibilities to overcome the cognitive obstacles of designers through automated generation or editing of design concepts. This article explores the capabilities of generative adversarial networks (GAN) for automated, attribute-aware generative design of the visual attributes of a product. Specifically, a design attribute GAN (DA-GAN) model is developed for automated generation of fashion product images with the desired visual attributes. Experiments on a large fashion dataset signify the potentials of GAN for attribute-aware generative design, verify the ability of editing attributes with relatively higher accuracy and uncover several key challenges and research questions for future work.},

The investigation collected sample data from a questionnaire survey, which reached 529 college teachers in China, and undertook data analysis employing SPSS 27.0 and AMOS 26.0. The findings revealed that: 1) college teachers’ behavioral intention to embrace AIATS is directly and significantly shaped by perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, trust and subjective norms; 2) factors such as observability, relative advantage and compatibility indirectly impact college teachers’ adoption willingness of AIATS through their perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness; 3) complexity of AIATS positively affects perceived ease of use by means of perceived time cost, thereby influencing behavioral intention; 4) sociocultural factors significantly impact the adoption and promotion of AIATS in China. By extending the applicability of TAM and IDT within the realm of educational technology acceptance, this study offers strategic recommendations geared towards educational policymakers and technology developers to promote the implementation of AIATS, and sheds light on educational technology adoption across diverse sociocultural landscapes.},

  abstract={Software vulnerabilities have been a major threat to everyone and have been exploited to gain unauthorized access to the systems. These vulnerabilities directly impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of these software systems. Traditional vulnerability detection tools are not effective and are unable to detect new and emerging vulnerabilities. There have been various incidents that were reported due to vulnerabilities in the web application that resulted in huge losses. It is vital to have accurate vulnerability detection tools. In this paper, the authors investigate and present the tool VulnerAI that can be used for vulnerability detection. VulnerAI uses the power of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) to provide users with the security insights of their code. The authors analyzed vulnerable PHP code snippets using GPT to identify potential security vulnerabilities. The authors also aim to demonstrate that GPT is a satisfactory tool for vulnerability detection, despite its reliability and use in solving many other tasks.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence chatbots like Chat-GPT have wide applications and are influential in the field of education. ChatGPT is revolutionizing education by offering personalized learning support and enhancing work productivity. At the same time, recent research increasingly focuses on the side effects arising from over-reliance on generative AI tools. This study explores the thinking choices, “dependence” and “critical thinking,” of international doctoral students using ChatGPT within a generative AI environment. Through semi-structured interviews with eight participants from the Auburn University Education Department, the research examines their experiences using ChatGPT. While ChatGPT enhances efficiency and academic communication, students recognize its limitations and the risks of over-reliance, such as diminished critical thinking and skill development, and increased procrastination. The findings highlight the importance to develop learners' AI literacy and critical thinking ability.},

  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are widely applied in image generation, but their use raises potential security concerns. We propose a novel adversarial attack method based on statistical analysis to identify and analyze the vulnerabilities of image classification systems, ultimately enhancing their defense capabilities. Specifically, we generate statistically significant yet minimally perturbed adversarial samples using GANs, facilitating adversarial learning between the generator and classifier to investigate the statistical characteristics of adversarial samples and their impact on classifier decisions. Through experimental analysis on classic image classification datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by comparing it against traditional approaches. Our results show that the adversarial samples generated successfully deceive multiple classifiers while maintaining natural statistical characteristics, revealing inherent distribution properties of adversarial samples.},

  abstract={The collaboration among multiple agents demands for efficient communication. However, the observational data in the multi-agent systems are typically voluminous and redundant and pose substantial challenges to the communication system when transmitted directly. To address this issue, this paper introduces a multi-agent communication scheme based on large language model (LLM), referred to as GPT-based semantic information extraction for multi-agent communication (GMAC). This scheme utilizes an LLM to extract semantic information and leverages the generative capabilities to predict subsequent actions, thereby enabling agents to make more informed decisions. The GMAC approach significantly reduces signaling expenditure exchanged among agents by extracting key semantic data via LLM. This method not only simplifies the communication process but also effectively reduces the communication overhead by approximately 53% compared to the baseline methods. Experimental results indicate that GMAC not only improves the convergence speed and accuracy of decision-making but also substantially decreases the signaling expenditure among agents. Consequently, GMAC offers a straightforward and effective method to achieve efficient and economical communication in the multi-agent systems.},

  abstract={This paper presents an innovative approach to enhancing context understanding in Generative Pretrained Models (GPTs), a critical step towards achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While GPTs have significantly advanced natural language processing, their understanding of context remains predominantly limited to linguistic structure. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel layer in the transformer model architecture that computes context weights, integrating both immediate and temporally decaying influences of past tokens. This layer is strategically positioned after the self-attention and before the feed-forward layers, enabling a more nuanced interpretation of sequential language data. Our approach involves the formulation of a decaying temporal factor, which allows the model to consider not only the immediate relevance of tokens but also their historical context. This factor is dynamically adjustable, offering a sophisticated method of context weighting that considers both current and extended contexts. The integration of this context weight into the self-attention mechanism enhances the model's capacity for a deeper, more accurate understanding of language, pushing the boundaries of current AI capabilities towards a system that mirrors human-like intelligence. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, showing its potential to significantly contribute to the development of AGI.},
