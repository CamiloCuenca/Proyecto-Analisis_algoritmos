  abstract={A humanist manifesto for the age of AIArtificial intelligence may be the most transformative technology of our time. As AI’s power grows, so does the need to figure out what—and who—this technology is really for. AI Needs You argues that it is critical for society to take the lead in answering this urgent question and ensuring that AI fulfills its promise.Verity Harding draws inspiring lessons from the histories of three twentieth-century tech revolutions—the space race, in vitro fertilization, and the internet—to empower each of us to join the conversation about AI and its possible futures. Sharing her perspective as a leading insider in technology and politics, she rejects the dominant narrative, which often likens AI’s advent to that of the atomic bomb. History points the way to an achievable future in which democratically determined values guide AI to be peaceful in its intent; to embrace limitations; to serve purpose, not profit; and to be firmly rooted in societal trust.AI Needs You gives us hope that we, the people, can imbue AI with a deep intentionality that reflects our best values, ideals, and interests, and that serves the public good. AI will permeate our lives in unforeseeable ways, but it is clear that the shape of AI’s future—and of our own—cannot be left only to those building it. It is up to us to guide this technology away from our worst fears and toward a future that we can trust and believe in.},

  abstract={This paper presents a novel framework for integrating AI-generated mini-games into business analysis education. As the field of business analysis evolves rapidly, educators face challenges in keeping curricula current and bridging the gap between theory and practice. Our framework addresses these issues by combining game-based learning principles with the capabilities of generative AI. We outline a structured approach for developing mini-games aligned with business analysis course topics and learning outcomes, incorporating key game design elements and evaluation metrics. To demonstrate the framework's application, we present a case study of an AI-generated stakeholder analysis game, showcasing how generative AI can facilitate rapid game development and content creation. The paper discusses the potential benefits of this approach, including enhanced student engagement, improved practical skill development, and the ability to quickly adapt to emerging topics in business analysis. We also address challenges and limitations, such as technical resource requirements and the need for empirical validation. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on innovative educational techniques in business analysis and opens new avenues for leveraging AI in educational game development.},

  year={2024},
  volume={12},
  number={},
  pages={179912-179943},
  abstract={Enhancing model performance in agricultural image analysis faces challenges due to limited datasets, biological variability, and uncontrolled environments. Deep learning models require large, realistic datasets, which are often difficult to obtain. Data augmentation, especially through Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has become essential in farming applications, generating synthetic images to improve model training and reduce the need for extensive image collection. This review explores various GAN approaches for image augmentation in farming, investigating their challenges and limitations. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 128 publications were analyzed to identify research trends and gaps in GAN applications within the farming industry. Key applications of GANs include plant classification, weed detection, animal detection and behavior recognition, animal health and disease analysis, plant disease detection, phenotyping, and fruit quality assessment. Persistent issues like limited training datasets, occlusion challenges, and imbalanced data hinder model performance across these applications. Recognizing these challenges is critical for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of farming operations. Finally, this review concludes with insights and future directions to foster progress in this field.},

  abstract={We contribute a design study on using visual analytics for AI-assisted music composition. The main result is the interface MAICO (Music AI Co-creativity), which allows composers and other music creators to interactively generate, explore, select, edit, and compare samples from generative music models. MAICO is based on the idea of visual parameter space analysis and supports the simultaneous analysis of hundreds of short samples of symbolic music from multiple models, displaying them in different metric- and similarity-based layouts. We developed and evaluated MAICO together with a professional composer who actively used it for five months to create, among other things, a composition for the Biennale Arte 2024 in Venice, which was recorded by the Munich Symphonic Orchestra. We discuss our design choices and lessons learned from this endeavor to support Human-AI co-creativity with visual analytics.},

  abstract={With the popularization of intelligent connected cars, the number of interactions between the vehicle's interior and the external network has increased, and the difficulty of malicious attacks on the car's internal network has also been greatly reduced. In order to effectively detect these malicious attacks, an intrusion detection system (IDS) is required. Unlike IDS, there are few known attack signatures for vehicle networks. In addition, IDS for vehicles requires high accuracy because any false positive error can seriously affect driver safety. In order to solve this problem, an IDS based on the deep learning Model-Generative Adversarial Nets is proposed. Experimental results show that this model has high accuracy in detecting malicious attacks and can effectively detect intrusions.},

  title={Understanding the Use Behaviour of Gen AI Among Full Time Students and Apprenticeship Trainees in Higher Education}, 
  year={2025},

  number={},
  pages={18-25},
  abstract={As we reach the second anniversary since the announcement of ChatGPT to the world in Nov 2022, the education sector, especially in the institutes of higher learning (IHLs) has seen an exponential growth in the use of Generative AI (Gen AI). The use of Gen AI in IHLs is warranted as it commits to preparing students for the workforce and is obliged in duty to embrace Gen AI in its classrooms. But the use of Gen AI in classrooms are not without challenges. A survey conducted in the US states that 85 % of undergraduates feel more comfortable using GenAI tools if they were vetted by academic sources, and a further 65 % agreed that AI will improve their learning. However, there are many factors that led to the student's agreement in the use of AI, in particular Gen AI. Among others, the student's own (i) performance expectation, in that using Gen AI will help improve their academic performance; (ii) or their social influence, in that people close to them encourage their use of AI for their academic work, (iii) or their perceived anthropomorphism of the AI tool, in that they find that they have a ‘buddy’ that is close to them and that they can confide in their buddy for any queries they have of their course contents, or (iv) that the institution policy encourages their use of Gen AI in their school work. This study reports on the use behaviour of two groups of students - full time versus part time students. The findings suggests that the full-time students' Gen AI use is driven by social influence and perceived anthropomorphism, while apprenticeship students are more driven by institutional policy. Both groups of students are equally driven by the use of Gen AI to improve their academic outcome.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={This paper presents an innovative method for designing high-performance electric motors by integrating machine learning (ML) based meta-modeling with a differential evolution (DE) optimization algorithm. The approach utilizes finite element analysis (FEA) data to train the ML meta-model, allowing for efficient optimization of high-power-density machines, such as the reluctance rotor and permanent magnet (PM) stator combined excitation motor, which is characterized by nonlinearities. The meta-modeling process employs an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with 3 hidden layers and uses the motor's geometrical variables as inputs. The accuracy of the meta-model in capturing the nonlinear relationships between design parameters, core losses, and torque is assessed using metrics such as Rsquared (R2), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), showing promising performance. This hybrid ML-DE framework aims to serve as an alternative approach for physics-based electric motor design and optimization, delivering substantial reductions in computational effort without compromising accuracy. Drive cycle analysis, which could benefit from a system-level optimization integration with the meta-model, was also investigated for a 100 kW rated experimentally tested prototype of the studied motor topology with promising results.},

  pages={494-516},
  abstract={Humans use signs, e.g., sentences in a spoken language, for communication and thought. Hence, symbol systems like language are crucial for our communication with other agents and adaptation to our real-world environment. The symbol systems we use in our human society adaptively and dynamically change over time. In the context of artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive systems, the symbol grounding problem has been regarded as one of the central problems related to symbols. However, the symbol grounding problem was originally posed to connect symbolic AI and sensorimotor information and did not consider many interdisciplinary phenomena in human communication and dynamic symbol systems in our society, which semiotics considered. In this paper, we focus on the symbol emergence problem, addressing not only cognitive dynamics but also the dynamics of symbol systems in society, rather than the symbol grounding problem. We first introduce the notion of a symbol in semiotics from the humanities, to leave the very narrow idea of symbols in symbolic AI. Furthermore, over the years, it became more and more clear that symbol emergence has to be regarded as a multifaceted problem. Therefore, second, we review the history of the symbol emergence problem in different fields, including both biological and artificial systems, showing their mutual relations. We summarize the discussion and provide an integrative viewpoint and comprehensive overview of symbol emergence in cognitive systems. Additionally, we describe the challenges facing the creation of cognitive systems that can be part of symbol emergence systems.},

  abstract={As natural disasters rise, traditional infrastructure may be damaged or ineffective, complicating the delivery of medical supplies. Using drones to deliver these supplies to affected areas is increasingly seen as an effective and necessary solution. However, managing drones under these constraints quickly becomes a complex problem requiring intelligent methods. This paper presents a novel approach to address the Medical Supply Drone Delivery (MSDD) problem in post-disaster scenarios by modeling it as a multi-objective optimization problem. We introduce the Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA), designed to optimize drone management during post-disaster situations. Using generative AI techniques, specifically ChatGPT, we augment limited COVID-19 datasets from Algeria to create realistic scenarios. We compare the results of the proposed approach with those obtained using advanced versions of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithms. The analysis of the experiment indicates that the proposed multi-objective SMA for the MSDD issue is highly competitive and provides significant performance enhancements.},

  abstract={As the development of information technologies such as large language models progresses, the traditional creation of digital educational resources by humans has gradually evolved into a human-machine collaborative approach, namely generative digital educational resources, where generative AI systems assist humans in resource production. Based on the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) model, an evaluation model affecting the quality of generative digital educational resources was constructed from the user perspective, mainly including the DER quality system, user perceived value, and user satisfaction. In this work, we present a number of experiments that shed light on this problem. By establishing a satisfaction structural equation model and using SPSS 26.0 software and Smart PLS 3.0 software for data analysis and verification, we further propose tests that demonstrate this evaluation framework has good performance in terms of reliability and validity. The results confirm the applicability of the model and the relationships among the latent variables in the model.},

  year={2025},

  pages={1-15},
  abstract={Low-light image enhancement aims to refine the lighting conditions of low-light images. However, existing enhancement methods lack an explicit learning mechanism for perceiving exposure, making it difficult to handle unevenly exposed low-light images. To address this issue, we propose a global-local collaborative transformer, an enhancer inspired by image editing experts, which exploits the collaboration between global and local adjustment to adaptively enhance low-light images with complex exposure. Specifically, the proposed model independently learns local and global self-attention to implement the heterogeneous adjustment required for low-light regions with different exposure, and then employs an illumination difference map to dynamically determine the contributions of the two types of adjustment. Meanwhile, we develop a feed-forward neural network integrating globality and locality to further promote the efficacy of the proposed collaborative learning paradigm. In addition, a history-aware contrastive loss is designed to encourage the model to generate high-quality enhanced images that approximate the distribution domain of the normal-light images. Experiments performed on several popular public datasets demonstrate that the proposed enhancer outperforms state-of-the-art models. In particular, it shows competitive performance for low-light images with uneven exposure. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Shecyy/GLCFormer.},

  abstract={Generative steganography, a novel paradigm in information hiding, has garnered considerable attention for its potential to withstand steganalysis. However, existing generative steganography approaches suffer from the limited visual quality of generated images and are challenging to apply to lossy transmissions in real-world scenarios with unknown channel attacks. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel robust generative image steganography scheme, facilitating zero-shot text-driven stego image generation without the need for additional training or fine-tuning. Specifically, we employ the popular Stable Diffusion model as the backbone generative network to establish a covert transmission channel. Our proposed framework overcomes the challenges of numerical instability and perturbation sensitivity inherent in diffusion models. Adhering to Kerckhoff’s principle, we propose a novel mapping module based on dual keys to enhance robustness and security under lossy transmission conditions. Experimental results showcase the superior performance of our method in terms of extraction accuracy, robustness, security, and image quality.},

  abstract={Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a common clinical emergency that can lead to brain damage or death in a serious situation with extremely high disability and mortality rates. In order to obtain effective treatment for patients timely, the rapid and accurate detection of ICH is crucial. Considering that different subtypes of bleeding correspond to different treatment strategies in clinical practice, it is necessary to quickly diagnose ICH at the early stage. Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most effective ways to detect ICH. For quantifying the lesions and facilitating the subsequent treatments, the segmentation of ICH based on CT images is an extremely important step. The paper presents a review of the task of ICH segmentation, elaborates on the properties of ICH data and the available datasets for research, provides a detailed introduction to the traditional and deep-learning methods, and outlines various improvement schemes for deep-learning models. Finally, the current research achievements in this field are summarized, some urgent problems are proposed, and future research development is foreseen.},

  abstract={The concept of the metaverse, derived from science fiction and video games, has been defined in various ways, including augmented reality, virtual reality, life logging, and mirror world. These different variants encompass existing realities and technologies, such as extended reality applications, virtual meetings, and smart devices. Despite the initial enthusiasm surrounding Meta's announcement last year of the “new” metaverse, there are concerns about its contraction and financial challenges. However, generative AI, exemplified by ChatGPT, has emerged as the trending topic, revolutionizing content generation and improving interactions. with chatbots. Focus has shifted from the metaverse to generative AI, although there are potential intersections between the two technologies. This article looks at the perspective of the educational metaverse, its benefits for learning, and the tools available for teachers at different skill levels, including beginner-level and advanced-level platforms. Generative AI offers opportunities for easier content creation, bridging the gap between beginner and advanced creators through a “prompt editing” methodology. The article concludes with a case study on developing an XR-based MOOC to teach Italian for foreign students, incorporating gamification elements and leveraging the EON-XR platform and ChatGPT for interactive lessons and put a magnifier on ethical aspects of Metaverse and Generative AI.},

  abstract={Music is one of the most universal forms of communication and entertainment across cultures. This can largely be credited to the sense of synesthesia, or the combining of senses. Based on this concept of synesthesia, we want to explore whether generative AI can create visual representations for music. The aim is to inspire the user’s imagination and enhance the user experience when enjoying music. Our approach has the following steps: (a) Music is analyzed and classified into multiple dimensions (including instruments, emotion, tempo, pitch range, harmony, and dynamics) to produce textual descriptions. (b) The texts form inputs of machine models that can predict the genre of the input audio. (c) The prompts are inputs of generative machine models to create visual representations. The visual representations are continuously updated as the music plays, ensuring that the visual effects aptly mirror the musical changes. A comprehensive user study with 88 users confirms that our approach is able to generate visual art reflecting the music pieces. From a list of images covering both abstract images and realistic images, users considered that our system-generated images can better represent pieces of music than human-chosen images. It suggests that generative arts can become a promising method to enhance users' listening experience while enjoying music. Our method provides a new approach to visualize music and to enjoy music through generative arts.},

The primary objective is to identify the most effective TTS model-vocoder combination and comprehend their advantages and disadvantages. We conduct rigorous evaluations of various TTS model-vocoder pairings to achieve this, utilizing the Lj-Speech-en dataset. We evaluated the naturalness of the synthesized speech by employing subjective Mean Opinion Score (MOS) assessments from 40 listeners.

We are at a crossroads, on the cusp of significant transformative changes that will impact society worldwide, revolutionizing global business operations and fundamentally altering how inanimate objects are perceived in a world increasingly reliant on autonomous systems. Symbiotic System Science (SSS) is a growing scientific area which is taking a leadership role in fostering consensus on how best to bring about symbiotic relationships between autonomous systems. Capitalizing on SSS insights and development, the recognition that SAS (Symbiotic Autonomous Systems) are poised to have a revolutionary impact on society over the coming years is quite straightforward. In present paper we discuss main implications of Autonomous System (AS), SAS and SSS to the incoming technological society.

  title={Hybrid Intelligence in Business Analytics: Integrating Large Language Models with Traditional Predictive Analytics}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={114-122},
  abstract={Business analytics faces growing complexity due to heterogeneous data sources, dynamic decision-making requirements, and the need for scalable yet interpretable solutions. Traditional machine learning (ML) models, although effective for pattern recognition, often struggle with preprocessing unstructured data and contextual adaptability. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) excel at semantic understanding but lack domain-specific precision and reliability. This paper introduces Hybrid Intelligence, a novel framework that synergizes rule-based systems, LLMs, and ML to bridge these gaps. The proposed system automates end-to-end business analytics work-flows through three core integrations. First, rule-guided LLMs streamline data preparation by combining deterministic logic (e.g., handling missing values) with context-aware recommendations from Groq’s DeepSeek-R1, reducing manual effort by 60% compared to conventional methods. Second, dynamic insight generation leverages LLMs to interpret natural language queries, generate visualizations, and explain trends, enabling non-experts to interact with tabular data. Third, ML model orchestration uses LLM-inferred problem categorization to automate predictive tasks (e.g., XGBoost for regression, LSTM for forecasting) while embedding rule-based constraints for compliance. Validated on financial and retail datasets, the framework demonstrates a 35% improvement in forecasting accuracy over standalone ML models and a 50% reduction in data preparation time. Case studies in supply chain optimization and customer churn prediction highlight its adaptability. By integrating deterministic safeguards with generative AI, the framework mitigates LLM hallucination risks while preserving flexibility. This work advances hybrid AI systems in business contexts, offering a scalable blueprint for combining structured logic, generative models, and predictive analytics.},

  abstract={Biomedical image segmentation (BIS) task is challenging due to the variations in organ types, position, shape, size, scale, orientation, and image contrast. Conventional methods lack accurate and automated designs. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based UNet has recently dominated BIS. This is the first review of its kind that microscopically addressed UNet types by complexity, stratification of UNet by its components, addressing UNet in vascular vs. non-vascular framework, the key to segmentation challenge vs. UNet-based architecture, and finally interfacing the three facets of AI, the pruning, the explainable AI (XAI), and the AI-bias. PRISMA was used to select 267 UNet-based studies. Five classes were identified and labeled as conventional UNet, superior UNet, attention-channel UNet, hybrid UNet, and ensemble UNet. We discovered 81 variations of UNet by considering six kinds of components, namely encoder, decoder, skip connection, bridge network, loss function, and their combination. Vascular vs. non-vascular UNet architecture was compared. AP(ai)Bias 2.0-UNet was identified in these UNet classes based on (i) attributes of UNet architecture and its performance, (ii) explainable AI (XAI), and, (iii) pruning (compression). Five bias methods such as (i) ranking, (ii) radial, (iii) regional area, (iv) PROBAST, and (v) ROBINS-I were applied and compared using a Venn diagram. Vascular and non-vascular UNet systems dominated with sUNet classes with attention. Most of the studies suffered from a low interest in XAI and pruning strategies. None of the UNet models qualified to be bias-free. There is a need to move from paper-to-practice paradigms for clinical evaluation and settings.},

  pages={144292-144302},
  abstract={The effectiveness of biosignal generation and data augmentation with biosignal generative models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), which are a type of deep learning technique, was demonstrated in our previous paper. GAN-based generative models only learn the projection between a random distribution as input data and the distribution of training data. Therefore, the relationship between input and generated data is unclear, and the characteristics of the data generated from this model cannot be controlled. This study proposes a method for generating time-series data based on GANs and explores their ability to generate biosignals with certain classes and characteristics. Moreover, in the proposed method, latent variables are analyzed using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to represent the relationship between input and generated data as canonical loadings. Using these loadings, we can control the characteristics of the data generated by the proposed method. The influence of class labels on generated data is analyzed by feeding the data interpolated between two class labels into the generator of the proposed GANs. The CCA of the latent variables is shown to be an effective method of controlling the generated data characteristics. We are able to model the distribution of the time-series data without requiring domain-dependent knowledge using the proposed method. Furthermore, it is possible to control the characteristics of these data by analyzing the model trained using the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to generate biosignals using GANs while controlling the characteristics of the generated data.},

  abstract={It is very significant to realize effective fault diagnosis of a gearbox in modern industrial systems. Undeniably, the traditional intelligent fault diagnosis methods such as back propagation (BP) neural network, recurrent neural network (RNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) might have a satisfactory performance in accuracy. However, the premise of this high accuracy is to add labels to all samples manually, which will undoubtedly increase the cost of failure detection. In this article, a semi-supervised fault diagnosis framework for a gearbox is proposed by utilizing GAN. First of all, fast Fourier transform (FFT) is adopted transform 1-D vibration signals into 2-D frequency spectrograms to fit the input format of GAN. Then, the frequency spectrograms are input into the GAN model to achieve fault diagnosis with few marked samples. Finally, an experiment study is carried out to confirm the excellent result of our approach in accuracy and stability. The results indicate that its performance in stability and accuracy is quite excellent.},

  pages={168236-168246},
  abstract={Wagon text extraction mainly depends on manual identification of relevant information, which is laborious, time consuming, monotonous and error-prone. To address this concern, we develop a two-stage wagon text extraction system based on the combination of transfer learning and defect-restore generative adversarial network (GAN). Considering the limited number of wagon images and vast computer resource required, wagon texts are first detected via refined connectionist text proposal network. In this study, we focus on text recognition and develop a generic strategy comprising an adversarial learning. The generator is made up of encoder-decoder-encoder sub-networks, enabling it to learn discriminative representations from the intermediate layer. In addition, by adding a random mask block prior to the generator and rebuilding the encoder with full convolution structure, the proposed strategy is able to significantly reduce the noise sensitivity of the encoder. The generated images are of high quality, even when the image is masked. The propose strategy yields an accuracy of 97.76% on 2682 real-world test sub-images, remarkably outperforms the prior arts. Furthermore, the proposed defect-restore GAN model performs well on synthetic images contaminated by three types of noise, which evidently verifies its robustness.},

  abstract={The main aim of this research is to identify and prevent fraudulent activities which can be achieved through AI related to facial recognition systems. Nowadays the usage of facial recognition systems is very high, and in the same way the scams by fraudsters are also increased in this research by using AI bots instead of humans. The main motive of this research is to identify the misuse of facial recognition technology. The proposed method using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) protects the individual privacy of people and their data. It detects whether the character in the image is an AI made or real human. This helps to ensure that only authorized people can use their information. Some of the sectors which use facial recognition systems are security, law enforcement, financial services, education, government services, retail. if unauthorized people access the above-mentioned sectors, the result will be imperiling. This method takes an image as an input and then python is used to process the image, importing a CV library to do this job. Next, we use deep learning models in python to identify whether the character in the image is AI generated or real human. The Computational Intelligence and Photography Lab at Yonsei University assembled a publicly available dataset for this work. Images of both real and fake human faces can be found in the Yonsei University Computational Intelligence and Photography Lab's database. The performance of the proposed system is measured using accuracy, precision and sensitivity. Experimental results shows that CNN based face recognition system outperforms.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) is developing strongly and widely applied in many fields, including in the aviation. This work provides a deep analysis of the impact of human interaction (HI) and weather effects (WE) on 4D-trajectory prediction using real data and various AI-based models: linear regression (LR – linear regression), random forest regression (RF – random forest), regression with extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and a deep neural network model (DNN-Deep neural network). The datasets used in this work contain ADS-B historical data of flights from Ho Chi Minh to Ha Noi in 14 days (12–26 November 2021) and time-synchronized weather data along the waypoints of each flight. We perform many experiments in different scenarios to evaluate the learning performance of LR, RF, XGBoost and DNN models against human interaction (HI) and weather effects (WE). The results prove that DNN model gives the highest accuracy and learning speed among AI-based models, but it is most sensitive to strange information of expert actions and/or weather changes.},

  pages={380-385},
  abstract={Diffusion models exhibit excellent diversity in image generation, but the randomness of diffusion models is unnecessary in the process of medical image modality translation. We propose the Manifold Optimization Adversarial Diffusion Model (MOADM) to suppress this randomness and improve the performance of medical image translation. MOADM predicts the linear relationship of evaluation metrics on image manifolds mapped in both latent space and noise space through a manifold consistency predictor. Aiming to select appropriate latent variables and noise, MOADM uses a non-dominated sorting multi-objective optimization genetic algorithm to iteratively optimize images based on the linear relationship, resulting in generated images with better texture, edges, and lower distortion. Extensive evaluations of MOADM against generative adversarial networks(GAN) and diffusion models in multicontrast MRI translation demonstrated superior performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.},

  abstract={This study examines the relationship between the continuance use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and creativity among higher education students, emphasizing the mediating role of cognitive response. Drawing on the Expectation-Confirmation Model for Information Systems Continuance (ECM-ISC) and the Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution (I-PACE) model, the research investigates how satisfaction, affect, and personality traits influence students’ intention to use AI tools and, through reflective cognitive engagement, enhance their creative performance. Data were collected from 288 undergraduate students via a structured questionnaire and analyzed using path analysis. The findings indicate that while satisfaction, affect, and personality traits significantly boost the intention to use AI, this intention impacts creativity only indirectly through cognitive response. These results highlight the importance of reflective engagement in harnessing AI for creative tasks and offer insights for its balanced integration into educational settings.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={According to the data mesh scheme for providing financial services, a data product based on customer transactions from the last 90 days is created within the operational domain. To obtain the data product, operational data corresponding to the open banking data model are anonymized, grouped, categorized, and further synthesized using GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks). The created data product is then transferred to the AI domain to determine customer credit ratings. This work investigates the operation and functionality of the AI domain, where the TensorFlow framework is used to create a neural network model. It is shown that the neural network model does not achieve maximum classification accuracy during training and testing but demonstrates high Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve. This indicates that the model effectively separates classes while maintaining high sensitivity in correctly detecting both positive and negative samples. Integrating this model with traditional banking processes for customer credit classification within the data mesh structure will enable a more reliable and comprehensive credit management system.},

  pages={894-922},
  abstract={The accuracies for many pattern recognition tasks have increased rapidly year by year, achieving or even outperforming human performance. From the perspective of accuracy, pattern recognition seems to be a nearly solved problem. However, once launched in real applications, the high-accuracy pattern recognition systems may become unstable and unreliable due to the lack of robustness in open and changing environments. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of research toward robust pattern recognition from the perspective of breaking three basic and implicit assumptions: closed-world assumption, independent and identically distributed assumption, and clean and big data assumption, which form the foundation of most pattern recognition models. Actually, our brain is robust at learning concepts continually and incrementally, in complex, open, and changing environments, with different contexts, modalities, and tasks, by showing only a few examples, under weak or noisy supervision. These are the major differences between human intelligence and machine intelligence, which are closely related to the above three assumptions. After witnessing the significant progress in accuracy improvement nowadays, this review paper will enable us to analyze the shortcomings and limitations of current methods and identify future research directions for robust pattern recognition.},

  abstract={AI-generated images are now widely used in various industries, including the art industry, advertising, healthcare, etc. The generative models used in making this happen are only getting incrementally powerful. However, as with any technology, these models are not immune to the inherent biases which are inadvertently introduced due to the discrimination reflected in the data. These biases in data can lead to undesirable consequences, such as reinforcing stereotypes, discrimination or perpetuating inequalities. Hence ‘Fairness’ in generative models is an increasingly crucial concept. This review paper discusses the biases and their types that percolate the deep learning models and are reflected in their results. The paper then presents a comprehensive overview of FairGAN and FairGAN+, two recently proposed generative models that aim to generate fair, accurate and diverse data, including their strengths and limitations. FairGAN incorporates fairness constraints into the objective function to generate fair data. FairGAN+ improves upon FairGAN by using multiple discriminators to achieve both fairness and accuracy in the generated data while also promoting diversity. Overall, FairGAN and FairGAN+ are promising approaches to addressing fairness in generative models. Further developments in this area are expected to lead to more effective techniques for generating fair and accurate data.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is profoundly reshaping the educational ecosystem, driving the transition of education into a new era characterized by "human-machine" collaborative evolution. In this context, cultivating innovative talents with "machine-irreplaceable" capabilities has become increasingly imperative, as critical thinking, creativity, and related competencies are now regarded as essential attributes for college students in the intelligent era. Nevertheless, the impact of GAI on students' creativity remains a subject of debate within academia, with no consensus on whether it enhances or undermines creative potential. To address this gap, this study investigated the influence of the generative AI tool Kimi AI on creativity among 113 college students, utilizing a single-factor between-subjects experimental design. Creativity was operationalized through scores obtained from an alien-drawing task, a widely recognized measure of divergent thinking. The results demonstrate that GAI, when employed as a "learning companion," facilitates sustained interaction with students, thereby effectively fostering the development of their creative abilities. As the transition from weak AI to strong AI progresses, a critical challenge in the intelligent era lies in determining how to effectively integrate GAI into educational frameworks to enhance not only creativity but also other core competencies essential for future-ready graduates.},

  abstract={Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a transformative educational tool, enabling immersive learning environments that promote student engagement and understanding of complex concepts. However, despite the growing adoption of VR in education, there remains a significant gap in research exploring how generative artificial intelligence (AI), such as generative pretrained transformer can further enhance these experiences by reducing cognitive load and improving learning outcomes. This study examines the impact of an AI-driven instructor assistant in VR classrooms on student engagement, cognitive load, knowledge retention, and performance. A total of 52 participants were divided into two groups experiencing a VR lesson on the bubble sort algorithm, one with only a prescripted virtual instructor (control group), and the other with the addition of an AI instructor assistant (experimental group). Statistical analysis of postlesson quizzes and cognitive load assessments was conducted using independent t-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA), with the cognitive load being measured through a postexperiment questionnaire. The study results indicate that the experimental group reported significantly higher engagement compared to the control group. While the AI assistant did not significantly improve postlesson assessment scores, it enhanced conceptual knowledge transfer. The experimental group also demonstrated lower intrinsic cognitive load, suggesting the assistant reduced the perceived complexity of the material. Higher germane and general cognitive loads indicated that students were more invested in meaningful learning without feeling overwhelmed.},

  pages={298-302},
  abstract={The goal of Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) methods is to classify unseen classes during testing, where no available data is provided during training. Unlike zero-shot recognition, test samples of GZSL include both seen and unseen classes. Current feature generation methods are based on generative adversarial networks, which synthesize visual features for unseen classes using their semantic descriptors. However, these methods still struggle to address the bias between seen and unseen classes. Therefore, this paper proposes a Semantic Feedback (SF) module based on generative adversarial models to mitigate the bias between seen and unseen classes. Specifically, we introduce a semantic feedback module with a feedback mechanism that iteratively improves the generated features during the training and feature synthesis stages. The synthesized visual features, along with their corresponding latent features, are then refined into discriminative features for the classification process to reduce class ambiguity. Competitive results obtained on four popular benchmark datasets demonstrate the significant potential and superiority of this proposed method.},

  abstract={With the continuous advancement of artificial intelligence technology, image inpainting, as an important branch of computer vision, has received widespread attention. The issue that lighting conditions significantly affect the identification and positioning of chess pieces in existing chess-playing robots is addressed in this paper, which proposes a general chessboard image inpainting method—Adversarial Masked Autoencoder (AMAE). This method, which combines Generative Adversarial Networks and Masked Auto-Encoders for joint training, is designed to enhance the quality of chessboard images. First, the masked autoencoder is pre-trained using chessboard images. Then, the pre-trained masked autoencoder is jointly trained with generator and discriminator. The adversarial principle of Generative Adversarial Networks is used to guide the training of the masked Autoencoder. A chessboard image with both clear texture details and global structural information is obtained. Finally, a dataset is created by collecting a large number of Go and Chinese chessboard images under different lighting conditions to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Attacks against computer system are viewed to be the most serious threat in the modern world. A zero-day vulnerability is an unknown vulnerability to the vendor of the system. Deep learning techniques are widely used for anomaly-based intrusion detection. The technique gives a satisfactory result for known attacks but for zero-day attacks the models give contradictory results. In this work, at first, two separate environments were setup to collect training and test data for zero-day attack. Zero-day attack data were generated by simulating real-time zero-day attacks. Ranking of the features from the train and test data was generated using explainable AI (XAI) interface. From the collected training data more attack data were generated by applying time series generative adversarial network (TGAN) for top 12 features. The train data was concatenated with the AWID dataset. A hybrid deep learning model using Long short-term memory (LSTM) and Convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed to test the zero-day data against the GAN generated concatenated dataset and the original AWID dataset. Finally, it was found that the result using the concatenated dataset gives better performance with 93.53% accuracy, where the result from only AWID dataset gives 84.29% accuracy.},

  abstract={Optical coherence tomography (OCT) plays an important role in the diagnosis of eye diseases like drusen, choroidal neovascularization, and diabetic macular edema. Accurate and timely interpretation of these images helps in the disease diagnosis and treatment plan. Though clinicians play a significant role in the interpretation of the diseased images, sometimes due to fatigue, experience level, intra- and interobserver variability, the interpretation the images may result in the wrong diagnosis or classification of the disease. To alleviate this problem, we employed the vision transformers (ViT) deep learning model to classify retinal diseases. Unlike convolution neural networks (CNN), which rely on local receptive fields, vision transformers (ViTs) utilize self-attention mechanisms that consider the entire image at once. This allows vision transformers (ViTs) to capture long-range dependencies and global relationships between pixels more effectively. With the consideration of both local (sub-segment) and global (entire image) context, vision transformers (ViTs) are effective in detecting both subtle and gross signatures of the disease in OCT images. Vision Transformers (ViTs) typically require large datasets for training from scratch due to the lack of inductive biases like locality and translation invariance that are inherent in CNNs. Hence, in this work, we have used a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate synthetic images to satisfy the large data constraint required to train vision transformers (ViTs). The trained model yields an overall accuracy of 90.5% on the test data set. Results are compared and contrasted with the quadrant approach and Shifted Window Transformer (SWIN) techniques.},

  pages={1-13},
  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and their several variants have not only been used for adversarial purposes but also used for extending the learning coverage of different AI/ML models. Most of these variants are unconditional and do not have enough control over their outputs. Conditional GANs (CGANs) have the ability to control their outputs by conditioning their generator and discriminator with an auxiliary variable (such as class labels, and text descriptions). However, CGANs have several drawbacks such as unstable training, non-convergence and multiple mode collapses like other unconditional basic GANs (where the discriminators are classifiers). DCGANs, WGANs, and MMDGANs enforce significant improvements to stabilize the GAN training although have no control over their outputs. We developed a novel conditional Wasserstein GAN model, called CWGAN (a.k.a RD-GAN named after the initials of the authors' surnames) that stabilizes GAN training by replacing relatively unstable JS divergence with Wasserstein-1 distance while maintaining better control over its outputs. We have shown that the CWGAN can produce optimal generators and discriminators irrespective of the original and input noise data distributions. We presented a detailed formulation of CWGAN and highlighted its salient features along with proper justifications. We showed the CWGAN has a wide variety of adversarial applications including preparing fake images through a CWGAN-based deep generative hashing function and generating highly accurate user mouse trajectories for fooling any underlying mouse dynamics authentications (MDAs). We conducted detailed experiments using well-known benchmark datasets in support of our claims.},

A robust image similarity retrieval system is utilized that connects generated images with actual images of products. Evaluation results using the Fréchet Inception Distance and Cosine similarity metrics of contrastive models demonstrate that the system produces coherent and visually consistent images.This work highlights the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence solutions in such specific fashion settings, giving designers and consumers an enriched, interactive experience of ethnically inspired outfits.},

  abstract={Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision (CV) provide the researchers in Failure Analysis and Reliability (FAR) as well as Hardware Security (HS) with new opportunities to design novel systems to locate security failures or malicious modifications. Such developments in automation and verification modes are extremely helpful in particular for government agencies who must physically assure chips with billions of transistors within critical applications. AI based techniques such as deep learning can provide a high-performance detection and recognition of elements from Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) images acquired from Integrated Circuits (ICs) and understand unseen images if they are trained well. However, they require a large and diverse set of images for building their knowledge. Possessing a large number of manufactured designs as well as the high cost and execution time associated with the image acquisition process are the major bottlenecks for creating a sufficient dataset. Alternatively, conventional data augmentation techniques such as intensity change, noise injection, rotation, and translation are not always able to project the variations of images acquired by SEM with different acquisition parameters. Furthermore, augmentations like rotation, translation, and shear might generate unacceptable augmented cell structures. This paper proposes a unique approach to detect logic cells on SEM images and use the extracted samples to generate diversified synthetic logic cell images by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to address insufficient data problems. We introduce an image quality assessment metric for the synthetic dataset in order to study the qualification of generated samples for recognition computations.},

  abstract={As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to integrated into our daily lives, it becomes increasingly crucial to prioritize the security of these systems, particularly at the physical layer. The physical layer is the foundational level of communication systems, responsible for transmitting data over a communication medium. The advent of AI has brought about significant advancements in the field of cybersecurity, introducing new attack methodologies and empowering countermeasures at the physical layer of communication systems. This dual aspect of AI has made it a critical component in maintaining the security and integrity of these systems. However, despite many existing efforts to apply AI into physical layer security, there is still a lack of comprehensive overview of attacks and countermeasures regarding AI-based attacks and countermeasures in this domain. In this article, we provide a general survey on AI -enabled attacks and AI-empowered countermeasures in the physical layer, and analyze its performance using two sets of proposed standards: evaluation criteria for AI -enabled attacks and AI -empowered countermeasures.

  abstract={The technology of generative adversarial networks (GAN) is constantly evolving, and synthesized images can no longer be accurately distinguished by the human eyes alone. GAN has been applied to the analysis of satellite images, mostly for the purpose of data augmentation. Recently, however, we have seen a twist in its usage. In information warfare, GAN has been used to create fake satellite images or modify the image content by putting fake bridges, buildings and clouds to mislead or conceal important intelligence. To address the increasing counterfeit cases in satellite images, the goal of this research is to develop algorithms that can classify fake remote sensing images robustly and efficiently. There exist many techniques to synthesize or manipulate the content of satellite images. In this paper, we focus on the case when the entire image is forged. Three satellite image synthesis methods, including ProGAN, cGAN and CycleGAN will be investigated. The effect of image pre-processing such as histogram equalization and bilateral filter will also be evaluated. Experiments show that satellite images generated by different GANs can be easily identified by individually trained models. The performance degraded when model trained with one type of GAN samples is employed to determine the originality of images synthesized with other types of GANs. Additionally, when histogram equalization is applied to the images, the detection model fails to distinguish its authenticity. A four-class universal classification model is proposed to address this issue. An overall accuracy of over 99% has been achieved even when pre-processing has been applied.},

  abstract={Since 21st Century, Chinese paper cutting has been recognized as an important element of Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) of China, which served as a symbol of traditional aesthetics, cultural identity and social values. Due to their rich cultural importance, the digital protection of paper cutting artwork is crucial. Moreover, existing approaches such as Progressive Conditional Generative Adversarial Network with Archimedes Optimization Algorithm (PCGAN-AOA) struggle from generalizability, due to lack of ability to capture long range dependencies in paper cutting patterns. Hence, A hybrid novel approach namely, PCGAN with Vision Transformer (PCGAN-ViT) is proposed for digital protection of ICH and inheritance of Chinese paper cutting. Initially, the input data consists of complete paper cutting pattern images which are gathered from multiple sources such as local cultural heritage institutions, museums, and verified public repositories. Then these images are preprocessed by performing resizing through bilinear interpolation and normalization of pixels through min max scaling. Lastly, these preprocessed images are fed to the proposed PCGAN-ViT model, where PCGAN performs the generation of realistic samples and ViT is used to verify the stylistic correctness by classifying the generated patterns. Therefore, the proposed PCGAN-ViT achieved low Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.097 which outperformed existing PCGAN-AOA model},

  abstract={Deepfakes are fake images, videos, audio, and text content that appear to be real. They are now easier than ever to create because of different AI tools. They aregenerally legal and have legitimate applications in many areas, but now a days they are commonly used for exploitation. Anyone can use deepfake tools to create fakevideos or images that spread misinformation, harass andintimidate others, and ultimately ruin people’s lives. Facial mapping technologies are used by Cyber criminals to create an accurate facial symmetry data set. They swapthe face of a person on to the face of another person. To tackle this problems, we propose this Deepfake Detection System. Key feature of our model is to classify the given input video into real or fake class. Our model will detect weather the given video is real one or is generated (manipulated) by deepfake generation techniques. Existing methodology related to deepfake detection involves various techniques. Currently, existing detection systems are using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as a backbone, artificial neural networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) algorithms.

  abstract={This research paper intends to provide real-life applications of Generative AI (GAI) in the cybersecurity domain. The frequency, sophistication and impact of cyber threats have continued to rise in today’s world. This ever-evolving threat landscape poses challenges for organizations and security professionals who continue looking for better solutions to tackle these threats. GAI technology provides an effective way for them to address these issues in an automated manner with increasing efficiency. It enables them to work on more critical security aspects which require human intervention, while GAI systems deal with general threat situations. Further, GAI systems can better detect novel malware and threatening situations than humans. This feature of GAI, when leveraged, can lead to higher robustness of the security system. Many tech giants like Google, Microsoft etc., are motivated by this idea and are incorporating elements of GAI in their cybersecurity systems to make them more efficient in dealing with ever-evolving threats. Many cybersecurity tools like Google Cloud Security AI Workbench, Microsoft Security Copilot, SentinelOne Purple AI etc., have come into the picture, which leverage GAI to develop more straightforward and robust ways to deal with emerging cybersecurity perils. With the advent of GAI in the cybersecurity domain, one also needs to take into account the limitations and drawbacks that such systems have. This paper also provides some of the limitations of GAI, like periodically giving wrong results, costly training, the potential of GAI being used by malicious actors for illicit activities etc.},

  abstract={Visual–auditory sensory substitution systems can aid visually impaired people in traveling to various places and recognizing their own environments without help from others. Although several such systems have been developed, they are either not widely used or are limited to laboratory-scale research. Among various factors that hinder the widespread use of these systems, one of the most important issues to consider is the optimization of the algorithms for sensory substitution. This study is the first attempt at exploring the possibility of using deep learning for the objective quantification of sensory substitution. To this end, we used generative adversarial networks to investigate the possibility of optimizing the vOICe algorithm, a representative visual–auditory sensory substitution method, by controlling the parameters of the method for converting an image to sound. Furthermore, we explored the effect of the parameters on the conversion scheme for the vOICe system and performed frequency-range and frequency-mapping-function experiments. The process of sensory substitution in humans was modeled to use generative models to assess the extent of visual perception from the substituted sensory signals. We verified the human-based experimental results against the modeling results. The results suggested that deep learning could be used for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms for visual–auditory sensory substitutions without labor-intensive human behavioral experiments. The introduction of deep learning for optimizing the visual–auditory conversion method is expected to facilitate studies on various aspects of sensory substitution, such as generalization and estimation of algorithm efficiency.},

  abstract={Generative large language model (LLM) applications are rapidly growing, leading to widespread deployment of expensive, power-hungry GPUs. Growing power demands of artificial intelligence (AI) in the cloud industry has become a global problem.5 Our analysis shows that LLM inference involves two distinct phases: a compute-intensive prefill phase and a memory-intensive decode phase, each with different resource needs. Running them together introduces inefficient scheduling. Furthermore, unlike the prefill phase, the decode phase can run on lower-cost and lower-power hardware. Building on these insights, we propose Splitwise, a scheduling technique that splits prefill and decode phases across different machines to achieve better throughput. Additionally, Splitwise allows phase-specific hardware optimization. By efficiently transferring request state between machines, Splitwise achieves up to 2.35× more throughput within the same power and cost budgets, or 1.4× higher throughput at 20% lower cost and same power.},

  abstract={The widespread use of deepfake technology has raised significant concerns regarding the authenticity and credibility of digital content. Utilizing the power of generative adversarial networks (GANs), deepfakes are becoming more sophisticated, presenting substantial risks to privacy, security, and public trust in online media. Addressing this challenge requires the development of precise and resilient detection models. This paper introduces an advanced Dense Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) architecture for the detection of deepfakes, emphasizing both high accuracy and broad generalizability. The model is trained on diverse datasets, including CelebA, FFHQ, AttGAN, and StyleGAN2, ensuring a comprehensive representation of synthetic content across different generations. The proposed model attains a detection accuracy of 94.0%, with precision of 94.12%, recall of 93.12%, specificity of 94.79%, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 98.39%. Furthermore, the model excels in detecting deepfakes generated by various GAN architectures, such as AttGAN and StyleGAN2. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed model to effectively identify manipulated media, positioning it as a reliable tool for combating the growing threat of deepfakes in real-world applications.},

  abstract={Melanoma is the most harmful form of skin cancer and they emerge from melanocytes, a type of pigment-producing cells. Melanomas usually occur on the skin; they mostly form around the back for men, whereas the common place for women are legs. Once formed, symptoms of melanoma might include an increase in the size of some mole with irregular edges, or itchiness or changes in its color, etc. This paper reviews the latest research works on melanoma classification using CNN. The performance analysis of the state-of-the-art methods is done focusing only on the binary classification of melanoma. The dataset used for the performance analysis is based on SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification Challenge 2020, where the task was to identify melanoma using images of skin lesions by predicting a binary target for each image. The main intent of this study is to review the state-of-the-art deployments which identifies the recent research trends, challenges, and newer domains, like Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for melanoma classification and scrutinize the existing solutions for melanoma detection.},

  abstract={“Cloud data migration” describes the method of transferring digital data to new cloud services or garage structures. Data have to be transferred in a way that guarantees it remains available, secure, and uncompromised. Businesses might also easily adjust to new needs and trends in era by way of transferring their statistics, apps, or workloads to the cloud. Scalability, adaptability, and optimising charges are all made feasible by this. Generative AI can help us evaluate existing applications and provide insights into how they can be optimized for the target cloud environments. In the ever-evolving world of technology, Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative force, poised to revolutionize various industries and domains, including cloud migration. As the global landscape of migration continues to shift, GenAI is prepared to play an essential role in streamlining processes, enhancing accuracy, and improving overall migration outcomes. The review present paper investigates the utilisation of generative AI in order to facilitate the transfer of data from on-premises to the cloud. While highlighting the potential of generative AI to automate transfer operations, it tackles obstacles such as economic implications and security concerns. Migration techniques, the benefits of cloud migration, and pertinent literature are examined in this study, which also provides a summary of key findings and recommendations for future research.},

  abstract={Summary <p>From text and audio to images and animations, generative AI's capabilities are vast and varied. At the root level, generative AI is built on a large language model (LLM) that learns how to predict, based on statistical probabilities, what the readers want based on the prompt provided it. Essentially, when the readers provide a prompt to generative AI, it reaches into its extensive database to generate content that aligns with the context of their prompt. The richness and accuracy of its output are heavily contingent on the quality and clarity of the prompt readers give it. LLMs undergo extensive training where they ingest vast amounts of data from diverse sources, such as books, websites, articles, and magazines. Generative AI stands at the forefront of digital transformation, offering capabilities that, just a few years ago, seemed like the realm of science fiction. Its potential to revolutionize content creation and data processing is immense.</p>},

  abstract={With distributed energy resources (DER) continuing to grow, power systems are encountering increased challenges for resource inference and optimization in the distribution network. Given the intrinsic uncertainty and variability associated with various connected resources as well as their aggregated representation, generating diverse load scenarios is of great significance for system planning, operation, and control. However, traditional time series statistical methods, in the absence of supplementary meteorological data, have limited capabilities in accurately generating load scenarios. To address such issues, this paper proposes an Optical Flow Denoising Diffusion Transformer model (OFDDT) to generate representative load scenarios. Specifically, the optical flow denoising diffusion module is adopted to capture load fluctuation characteristics influenced by the temperature, while the Transformer module integrates variability and historical load features to generate load profile scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in such load scenario generation tasks, outperforming traditional generative artificial intelligence models.},

  volume={10},

  pages={33602-33615},
  abstract={An adversarial example, which is an input instance with small, intentional feature perturbations to machine learning models, represents a concrete problem in Artificial intelligence safety. As an emerging defense method to defend against adversarial examples, generative adversarial networks-based defense methods have recently been studied. However, the performance of the state-of-the-art generative adversarial networks-based defense methods is limited because the target deep neural network models with generative adversarial networks-based defense methods are robust against adversarial examples but make a false decision for legitimate input data. To solve the accuracy degradation of the generative adversarial networks-based defense methods for legitimate input data, we propose a new generative adversarial networks-based defense method, which is called Adversarially Robust Generative Adversarial Networks(ARGAN). While converting input data to machine learning models using the two-step transformation architecture, ARGAN learns the generator model to reflect the vulnerability of the target deep neural network model against adversarial examples and optimizes parameter values of the generator model for a joint loss function. From the experimental results under various datasets collected from diverse applications, we show that the accuracy of ARGAN for legitimate input data is good-enough while keeping the target deep neural network model robust against adversarial examples. We also show that the accuracy of ARGAN outperforms the accuracy of the state-of-the-art generative adversarial networks-based defense methods.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={This paper explores how Generative AI can transform Design for Safety & Reliability (DfSR) by proactively identifying and mitigating risks throughout the product development lifecycle. It examines three key approaches to leveraging generative AI in DfSR: Assistive Ai: This approach employs Large Language Models (LLMs) or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to interact dynamically with users. While highly flexible and agile, interpretability and control of AI-generated outputs remain areas of concern. Potential applications include providing diverse perspectives during brainstorming sessions. Scripted Ai: This approach uses predefined rules and scripts to automate repetitive tasks to improve the efficiency and consistency. However, its inflexibility limits its effectiveness in complex scenarios. We suggest using Scripted AI to automate routine tasks. Agentic Ai: This approach involves AI systems autonomously executing tasks, demonstrating a higher degree of “agency”. While offering real-time analysis and continuous learning capabilities, ethical considerations and system complexity present challenges. The paper highlights how these approaches can be applied across various stages of the DfSR workflow, from defining requirements and planning to risk assessment, design optimization, and sustainment. Each stage benefits from the unique strengths of each AI approach. We also emphasize the limitations of Generative AI tools. We recommend maintaining human oversight in critical decisions, treating AI as collaborators, and continuously monitoring AI systems for reliability and performance. As AI technology advances, its integration into engineering workflows promises safer, more reliable, and innovative products. Continued research and development in AI will be crucial for realizing the full potential of AI in shaping the future of DfSR.},

  abstract={Due to the limitation of the establishment of pathological voice database, the number of samples is often insufficient and imbalanced, which causes the defect of many deep learning methods to be used in pathological voice database. In this paper, generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to generate the features of voice data to improve the imbalanced distribution of samples. GAN uses a generator and a discriminator for adversarial training to generate data similar to the original data distribution. Back propagation generative adversarial network (BPGAN) and deep convolution generative adversarial network (DCGAN) are used to generate vector features and matrix features respectively. It is found that the recall of minority sample is significantly higher when using balanced training set added data generated by GAN than imbalanced training set. Scatter diagram of generated feature vector and grayscale diagram of feature matrix are drawn. By adding the feature vector generated by BPGAN and DCCGAN, the recall of the test set for the minority sample is increased by 4.75%, and 21% respectively. The results show that GAN can generate different feature sets of pathological voice effectively.},

  abstract={Traffic flow prediction holds great promise in prompting the rapid development of intelligent transportation systems. The key challenge for traffic flow prediction lies in effectively modeling the complicated spatiotemporal dependencies of traffic data while considering privacy and cost concerns. Existing methods based on neural networks exhibit limitations, particularly in handling dynamic data and long-distance dependencies. To address these challenges, we have proposed a novel distributed traffic flow prediction architecture that makes the integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and hierarchical federated learning. This architecture makes the prediction of traffic flow by incorporating spatial self-attention module and traffic delay-aware feature transformation module, which achieves a better balance between communication and computation costs, enhances training efficiency and guarantees data privacy and security. Next, we have introduced the important characteristics and key technologies used for this devised architecture. Finally, several open issues are given with the aim to attract more attentions for further investigation.},

  abstract={This paper explores the use of Generative AI and ChatGPT for improving the production of distance learning materials. We have conducted participatory design workshops involving cross-disciplinary teams of academics and different stakeholders, such as industry partners and learning material designers that are involved in course production at the UK Open University. The main outcome of these workshops is a set of use cases on how Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, can be integrated and augment the existing course production and delivery processes to make them more agile and efficient. Following the workshops, we have developed a proof-of-concept tool that can instantly generate introductions and summaries of course material, automatically generate quizzes and tests, as well as automatically identify, categorise, and transform learning activities. A preliminary evaluation performed with members of the course production teams indicated that in 40% of cases AI generated text of 250-500 words is suitable for use in distance learning materials. Overall, the evaluation participants welcome this use of Generative AI, but there are concerns mainly centred on potential for bias, misinformation, and copyright infringement in the generated learning materials.},

  year={2020},
  volume={8},
  number={},
  pages={194551-194560},
  abstract={Retinal blood vessels are the basis for clinical diagnosis of some diseases. Achieving automatic retinal vessel segmentation from fundus images is an important and challenging work. In this paper, a neural network architecture based on the Dense U-net using Inception module is proposed for retinal vessel segmentation. First, the skip connections in traditional U-net are replaced with Dense Block to achieve full fusion of features from shallow layers to deep layers. Then, the Inception module is applied to supersede the traditional convolution operation. Thus, vessel features corresponding to the convolution kernels of different sizes can be extracted. Finally, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are adopted in the training phase. The Dense U-net using Inception module is treated as the generator of GAN, and a multilayer neural network is created as the discriminator of GAN. The generator and discriminator are trained alternately. The loss function is a combination of segmentation loss and GAN loss. So that segmentation results can be fitted to the ground truth from both pixel value and pixel distribution. The algorithm proposed in this paper is verified on the public Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE) dataset, where the Dice rate reaches 82.15%, and the AU-ROC and AU-PR reach 0.9772 and 0.9058, respectively. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm is effective in realizing automatic retinal vessel segmentation.},

  abstract={With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the rapid growth of Generative AI, significant progress has been made in image captioning, delivering remarkably precise captions from static images and, more recently, videos [1]. Alt-Text has significantly progressed due to initiatives aimed at improving the context and sentiment recorded during automated captioning. This paper seeks to elaborate on a portion concerning Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its significance in enhancing accessibility and context-awareness within the framework of the American Sign Language (ASL) application. This work presents a case study on significance of providing complete context regarding a caption or image to the end user, encompassing emotions and conscious attributes present within the phrase. This paper extensively elaborates on the accessibility functions presently involved in image-captioning. Is user-dependent (requiring users to supply a caption for the image) or standard machine-created alt-text sufficient for complete accessibility? Might incorporating a sign language, such as American Sign Language (ASL), be essential in providing users with more information than what the text of a caption communicates? The key question is: how can we enhance this image-caption translation to be more context-sensitive to convey the subtleties that could be crucial for user comprehension? The aim is to create a world where all voices resonate and every person feels accepted, and this paper represents an initial move towards an AI revolution that might be crucial in realizing that vision.},

  abstract={The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically in generative AI (GenAI) for music, potentially empowers musicians to incorporate rich ensembles of musical sounds in their live performances with much less effort. Musicians and disk jockeys can now enhance their live acts by taking advantage of AI technologies to a) curate a list of musical tracks for performance by gathering an understanding of the venue of performance and their audience in terms of their musical tastes b) enhance the curated playlist with the identification and selection of additional musical elements or loops to add to the overall appeal of their live performances. Both curating musical playlists as well as identifying and generating loops corresponding to tracks in the playlist are carried out manually in the current practice and are heavily reliant on the musicianship of an artist. In our work, we explore an approach that uses GenAI tools to work alongside traditional music production platforms such as the Digital Audio Workstations (DAW) to help musicians curate their set-list and generate musical loops as per the set-list with much less effort. We have developed an initial demonstrator that shows promising use of GenAI tools and also points out gaps in the available GenAI tools. We share our initial findings in this poster paper.},

  abstract={Since protein structure prediction is very important for biochemical studies, researchers have developed many deep learning-based AI models to predict protein structure using sequence information only. In order to further enhance the performance of deep learning-based AI system for protein structure prediction, diverse and realistic new protein samples need be generated. These protein samples can provide additional patterns to enhance training of the computational system. Traditionally, researchers use the single generative model to explore the complex data distribution from the whole dataset, which is very challenging task. In order to overcome this problem, we propose Clustering Diffusion Model (CDM) which organizes multiple Diffusion Models (DMs) in the tree. Each DM in the tree can learn the unique local data distribution for one protein subfamily instead of attempting to understand the data distribution of the entire dataset. Consequently, CDM has great potentials to generate more diverse and reasonable protein samples than the single generative model. Experimental results demonstrate that CDM can further enhance the performance of protein structure prediction as compared to the single generative model while the construction time of CDM is reduced due to the parallel strategy.},

Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, our work focuses on pinpointing imperceptible diseases. The performance of the classification model depends on the informativeness of the feature map. Therefore, we compare various models specialized for this purpose. Given the characteristics of plant diseases, many complexities make it challenging to distinguish between different illnesses. In this study, we reaffirm the exceptional performance of the Residual Attention Network (RAN) consisting of residual blocks and attention modules. We have previously reviewed a paper on the combined Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) of residuals and attention, which has proven advantageous in exploring the inherent complexities of these challenges. The primary goal of our study is to utilize artificial intelligence to identify the best-performing disease classification model.

  year={2024},

  pages={1-10},
  abstract={The key to solving multimodal multi-objective optimization problems is to achieve good diversity in the decision space. However, the existing algorithms usually adopt the reproduction operation based on random mechanism, which do not make full use of the distribution features of promising solutions in the population, resulting in the defects of the diversity of the obtained Parteo optimal solution sets. In order to solve the above problem, this paper proposes a multimodal multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithm (MMOEA) based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). Specifically, we firstly design a classification strategy to distinguish good solutions from poor solutions. The solutions in the population are classified as real samples and fake samples by non-dominated selection sorting based on special crowding distance, and the training data of GANs are obtained. Secondly, a GANs-based offspring generation method is proposed. Through the adversarial training of GANs, the generator can simulate the distribution of promising solutions in the population and generate offspring with good diversity. Thirdly, an environment selection strategy based on GANs is constructed. By sorting the classification probability of the solutions output by the discriminator, the population are selected and updated. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with seven other competitive multimodal multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithms on the CEC 2019 test suite and a real-word problem, and experimental results indicate its superior performance.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) stands at the forefront of AI innovation, demonstrating rapid advancement and unparalleled proficiency in generating diverse content. Beyond content creation, GAI has significant analytical abilities to learn complex data distribution, offering numerous opportunities to resolve security issues. In the realm of security from physical layer perspectives, traditional AI approaches frequently struggle, primarily due to their limited capacity to dynamically adjust to the evolving physical attributes of transmission channels and the complexity of contemporary cyber threats. This adaptability and analytical depth are precisely where GAI excels. Therefore, in this paper, we offer an extensive survey on the various applications of GAI in enhancing security within the physical layer of communication networks. We first emphasize the importance of advanced GAI models in this area, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Autoencoders (AEs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). We delve into the roles of GAI in addressing challenges of physical layer security, focusing on communication confidentiality, authentication, availability, resilience, and integrity. Furthermore, we also present future research directions focusing model improvements, multi-scenario deployment, resource-efficient optimization, and secure semantic communication, highlighting the multifaceted potential of GAI to address emerging challenges in secure physical layer communications and sensing.},

  title={GAN-Based Framework for Unified Estimation of Process-Induced Random Variation in FinFET}, 
  year={2022},

  pages={130001-130023},
  abstract={For higher density of transistors in Integrated Circuit (IC), various scaling technologies have been introduced. In the light of the physical limit in advancing single-gate transistor architecture, the structural transition from planar device architecture toward 3D device architecture (of which the representative one is Fin-shaped Field-Effect Transistor, or FinFET) manifests itself. However, during fabrication, the unexpected process-induced random variations of the transistor’s electrical characteristics have become more extreme with aggressively scaling down the physical dimension of transistor as well as with evolving from 2D to 3D device structure. Consequently, accurate and rapid estimation of the random variations conditioned on the variation sources (e.g., LER, RDF, and WFV) is required. Recently, machine learning-based approaches were utilized to estimate the LER-induced variations, but they were highly dependent on modeling and evaluation assumptions (e.g., Gaussian or independence). To that end, firstly, we introduce a GAN-based framework for the estimation of process-induced random variations. Since GAN is free from distributional assumptions, this enables precise prediction and, more importantly, enables unified estimation, i.e., adaptable to various variation sources. Secondly, to achieve better generalization on unseen conditions, we additionally suggest a two-step learning strategy utilizing the latest Conditional GAN models. Thirdly, we introduce sample-based evaluation procedure which measures the difference between two sample sets from a probabilistic perspective. Finally, the evaluation results on LER and RDF/WFV datasets show that our GAN-based framework is computationally efficient and is able to generate synthetic samples similar to the TCAD simulated samples that contain random variations, both qualitatively and quantitatively. From such results, our GAN-based framework is expected to be successfully applied to real data, and consequently be able to reliably estimate the random variations of fabricated transistors with multiple orders of magnitude speed-up compared to the conventional TCAD simulation-based estimation.},

  title={A Mixed Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning Based Vehicle Path Planning Algorithm}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={12},

  pages={85859-85879},
  abstract={Vehicle path planning is one of the effective ways to relieve the huge traffic flow pressure of modern urban transportation system, and it is also an important way to realize carbon emission reduction and to build green transportation system as well as smart city. At present, the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms with reinforcement learning (RL) as the mainstream have achieved great success in the field of vehicle path planning. However, RL only conducts policy learning based on the evaluation feedback of the environment, whereas imitation learning (IL) can obtain more direct feedback from expert decision data, and then obtain a decision model close to the expert level by comparing with RL. At present, there are very few vehicle path planning algorithms based on IL, and they are often hindered by the compounding error and sample complexity dilemma, resulting in poor path planning effectiveness. In order to overcome these problems, in this paper, a mixed generative adversarial IL (MixGAIL) algorithm has been proposed, which effectively integrates the transition aware adversarial IL (TAIL) and generative adversarial IL (GAIL) based on minimum-distance functions (MIMIC-MD) methods under the framework of GAIL. In order to overcome the optimization dilemma of non-convex and non-smooth objective function after the integration, the proposed MixGAIL uses mixed policy gradient actor-critic model with random escape term and filter optimization (MPGACEF), and pioneers the noise projected subgradient descent method with momentum (MNPSGD) for global optimization. Experiments have shown that by learning expert decision data, MixGAIL has better vehicle path planning performance and faster iteration speed than classic IL algorithms such as behavioral cloning (BC), dataset aggregation (DAgger), feature expectation matching (FEM), game theoretical appraisal learning (GTAL), TAIL, and MIMIC-MD, and is closer to expert level.},

  title={Masked Feature Modeling for Generative Self-Supervised Representation Learning of High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={17},
  number={},
  pages={8434-8449},
  abstract={Intelligent interpretation of remote sensing images using deep learning is heavily reliant on large datasets, and models trained in one domain often struggle with crossdomain application. Pretraining the backbone network via masked image modeling can effectively diminish this reliance on extensive sample data, thereby reducing crossdomain transfer obstacles. However, current masked image models typically employ a pure Transformer architecture, which may not fully capitalize on low-level features. To address these issues, this article proposes masked feature modeling (MFM), a methodology for the generative self-supervised learning of high-resolution remote sensing images that combines convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer architectures. This methodology has several advantages: 1) The hybrid CNN + Transformer architecture not only retains the advantages of the local feature representation of the CNN architecture but also has the full-text information modeling capabilities of the Transformer architecture; 2) the feature extraction network outputs multiscale features, and it is easier to add upsampling and a skip connection to improve the accuracy of the downstream dense prediction task; and 3) the pretrained MFM can be applied to various downstream tasks through fine-tuning with limited samples. The publicly available WHU and Massachusetts Building Datasets are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Extensive experiments involving main properties of the MFM for generative self-supervised learning, fine-tuning the MFM on the downstream semantic segmentation task, and comparisons with the other state-of-the-art generative self-supervised learning algorithms show that, through the combined advantages of the CNN and Transformer architectures, the proposed method has better feature extraction capability and higher accuracy on downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation.},

  abstract={With the development of artificial intelligence technology, data has become an important resource with much attention being attracted. However, in the process of data collection, transmission and storage, data missing happens inevitably due to various reasons. In order to reduce the impact of missing data on data application, this paper proposes a multiple imputation model for missing data based on conditional variational autoencoder. The model is trained on an incomplete dataset, using multiple sampling from the latent space to generate multiple estimates. In the model accuracy of the estimates has been improved, constrained by classification label of the data. Experiments were carried out on open source datasets and evaluated with existing imputation methods.},

  pages={1369-1374},
  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools like GitHub's Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, and OpenAI's Codex now generate an estimated 20-30% of code in many enterprise codebases. As these tools rapidly transform software development through automated code generation, algorithm design, and problem-solving capabilities, they introduce essential challenges in accountability, quality assurance, and long-term code maintenance. This paper investigates the imperative need for transparency in GenAI codebases, presenting empirical evidence for comprehensive strategies addressing quality assurance, security, intellectual property management, and regulatory compliance. The findings demonstrate that GenAI codebase transparency is essential for safety and ethical AI development, with robust code provenance tracking systems offering significant organizational benefits. The paper concludes by recommending that organizations integrate enhanced development tools and prepare proactively for incoming regulatory changes. Key Contributions include a comprehensive analysis of GenAI code transparency requirements and stakeholder impacts, technical implementation guidance for transparency systems, and forward-looking recommendations for continued industry adoption.},

  abstract={Summary <p>The state of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is a combination of brilliant successes, enormous potential, and a fair degree of frustration. Despite that, however, there are already successful AI&#x2010;driven systems in use meeting a variety of healthcare needs in areas including pharmaceutical drug discovery, diagnosis of illnesses, and hospital care. Drug discovery is one of the more significant forms of research currently being conducted with the help of AI algorithms. Clinical trials cost quite a bit of money, and these costs are increasing. For pathologists, images are an essential source of diagnostic and prognostic information. An use of AI and big data was Google's attempt to predict both heart disease and high blood pressure. Palliative care can be administered at precisely the right time so that patients can take advantage of the different services available when they need them, including appropriate pain management, psychological support, and support for social, cultural, and spiritual needs.</p>},

  abstract={In cyber–physical–social systems, smart manufacturing has to overcome challenges, such as uncertainty, diversity, complexity in modeling, long-delayed responses to market changes, and human engineer dependency. DeFACT is a framework of parallel manufacturing in ManuVerse where the Decentralized Autonomous Organization-based interactions between parallel workers consisting of robotic, digital, and human workers are elaborated to transform from professional division to real-virtual division. In DeFACT, human workers are only responsible for 5% physical and mental work that is complex and creative, and the robotic and digital workers can take care of the rest. The perceptual and cognitive intelligence of digital workers are intensified by a manufacturing foundation model (MF-PC), where calibration and certification (C&C), and verification and validation (V&V) guarantee not only the accuracy of task models, but also the interpretability and controllability of feature learning. As a case study, the workflow of customized shoes of SANBODY Technology Company is illustrated to show how DeFACT breaks the time and space constraints, avoids production waste caused by aesthetic discrepancies with consumers, and truly realizes flexible manufacturing.},
