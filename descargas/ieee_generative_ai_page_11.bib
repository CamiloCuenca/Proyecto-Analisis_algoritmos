  abstract={Summary <p>This chapter delves into how we can directly integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into marketing teams. Successfully integrating AI into marketing requires broader organizational alignment. The chapter shows how AI&#x2010;enhanced marketing operations link to other functions and promote the establishment of a cohesive, informed, and flexible business environment. The successful integration of AI into marketing requires a collaborative effort across all levels of an organization. Marketers may find the AI&#x2010;related changes even more profound, lasting, and potentially career&#x2010;altering than the previous shifts in communications and customer connections. Marketing leaders can take actions in a similar fashion to the federal government's approach to implementing and governing the use of AI. In the AI&#x2010;driven era, marketing functions must not only adapt to new technologies but also redefine roles and workflows to optimize collaboration between human teams and AI copilots. One of the drivers limiting AI adoption is organizational inertia and cultural barriers.</p>},

  abstract={The Customized Face Generator (CFG) emerges as a ground-breaking response to a substantial challenge in the rapidly developing fields of computer graphics and artificial intelligence. Background issues for this study include the need to address ethical issues related to bias and representation in these digital identities as well as the growing desire for realistic and adaptable human faces across a range of industries, from entertainment to digital marketing. The design and development of a system that effortlessly blends diversity, realism, and personalization while preserving ethical standards is the main issue this research attempts to solve. It intends to provide users with the tools to create distinctive faces while upholding individual identities and avoiding damaging prejudices in generated content. The CFG’s ability to transform digital representation is its primary significance. It allows users to generate a variety of lifelike faces by utilizing cutting-edge deep learning techniques like GANs and VAEs, making for more engaging digital experiences and fostering greater individual expression. Modern technologies and ethical considerations are incorporated into the study approach. The architecture of the CFG is made to gradually add layers of complexity to faces as they are generated, giving them a more realistic appearance. In order to prevent offensive content, an easy-to-use customizing interface is created. The key result of from this research project includes a face creation system that is extremely adjustable and morally upright. The usefulness of the CFG is shown through quantitative metrics assessing diversity, realism, and user happiness together with qualitative evaluations. The CFG has enormous global relevance. It opens up a new level of inclusion and personalization in digital settings, having an impact on fields that depend on visual communication. This study adds to the ongoing conversation around moral AI and lays out a plan for responsible innovation, where technology meets both practical needs and social conscience.},

  abstract={The healthcare industry undergoes a transformative shift with the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in medical imaging analysis. AI algorithms, trained on extensive datasets, demonstrate accuracy comparable to medical experts, promising earlier diagnoses and improved outcomes. However, challenges in widespread AI adoption include limited access to high-quality medical datasets and concerns about data privacy. These challenges hinder progress, as existing datasets often suffer from obsolescence. Overcoming these limitations is crucial for advancing AI research in healthcare. Leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) addresses data scarcity by generating synthetic medical data that maintains essential features without compromising patient privacy. GANs present a solution to challenges related to data availability and quality, unlocking new opportunities for innovation in medical AI research and clinical practice.},

  abstract={Recently, artificial intelligence and machine learning in general have demonstrated remarkable performances in many tasks, from image processing to natural language processing, especially with the advent of deep learning (DL). Along with research progress, they have encroached upon many different fields and disciplines. Some of them require high level of accountability and thus transparency, for example, the medical sector. Explanations for machine decisions and predictions are thus needed to justify their reliability. This requires greater interpretability, which often means we need to understand the mechanism underlying the algorithms. Unfortunately, the blackbox nature of the DL is still unresolved, and many machine decisions are still poorly understood. We provide a review on interpretabilities suggested by different research works and categorize them. The different categories show different dimensions in interpretability research, from approaches that provide “obviously” interpretable information to the studies of complex patterns. By applying the same categorization to interpretability in medical research, it is hoped that: 1) clinicians and practitioners can subsequently approach these methods with caution; 2) insight into interpretability will be born with more considerations for medical practices; and 3) initiatives to push forward data-based, mathematically grounded, and technically grounded medical education are encouraged.},

  abstract={As a new unsupervised learning algorithm framework, generative adversarial networks(GAN) have been favored by more and more researchers, and it has become a research hotspot now. GAN is inspired by the two-person zero-sum game theory in game theory. Its unique adversarial training idea can generate high-quality samples and has more powerful feature learning and feature expression capabilities than traditional machine learning algorithms. At present, GAN has achieved remarkable success in the field of computer vision, especially in the field of sample generation. Every year, a large number of GAN-related research papers are produced, reflecting the fiery degree of research on GAN model. Aiming at the hot model of GAN, first introduce the research status of GAN; then introduce the theory and framework of GAN, which analyzes in detail why the gradient disappears and the mode collapses during the training of GAN; then discussed some typical GAN improvement models, and summarized their theoretical improvements, advantages, limitations, application scenarios and implementation costs; Finally, the application results of GAN in data generation, image super-resolution, and image style conversion are shown, and the current challenges and future research directions of GAN are discussed.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={141-146},
  abstract={Contrast-Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) is a dual-energy mammographic technique that improves lesion visibility through the administration of an iodinated contrast agent. It acquires both a low-energy image, comparable to standard mammography, and a high-energy image, which are then combined to produce a dual-energy subtracted image highlighting lesion contrast enhancement. While CESM offers superior diagnostic accuracy compared to standard mammography, its use entails higher radiation exposure and potential side effects associated with the contrast medium. To address these limitations, we propose Seg-CycleGAN, a generative deep learning framework for Virtual Contrast Enhancement in CESM. The model synthesizes high-fidelity dual-energy subtracted images from low-energy images, leveraging lesion segmentation maps to guide the generative process and improve lesion reconstruction. Building upon the standard CycleGAN architecture, Seg-CycleGAN introduces localized loss terms focused on lesion areas, enhancing the synthesis of diagnostically relevant regions. Experiments on the CESM@UCBM dataset demonstrate that Seg-CycleGAN outperforms the baseline in terms of PSNR and SSIM, while maintaining competitive MSE and VIF. Qualitative evaluations further confirm improved lesion fidelity in the generated images. These results suggest that segmentation-aware generative models offer a viable pathway toward contrast-free CESM alternatives.},

  abstract={Our research was aimed at developing methods and algorithms for identifying and mapping fracture zones of the Jurassic and pre-Jurassic complexes based on seismic data and methods of machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this paper it were developed and tested: the feature selection algorithm based on an autoencoder for interpreting data on seismic slices with low intraclass and high interclass variability, as well as the algorithm for synthesizing new images based on generative adversarial networks and a seismic database. The experiments carried out have shown that the algorithms have good accuracy and speed of operation, which makes them potentially suitable for processing large volumes of seismic information.

  abstract={The aim of this research paper is to present a novel approach of using Relevance Generative Answering (RGA) in the trending field of Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The paradigm shift in the RAG system by the introduction of Agentic RAG has opened a new research paradigm. The major issue of hallucination is overcome with the use of a traditional RAG system with some limitations like accuracy and relevance, lack of reasoning, the lost in the middle problem, etc. The Agentic RAG system attempts to address a few of these limitations. However, interpreting results based on the user's intent remains a significant area of research. This research aimed to understand user intent by introducing relevance detection block in the proposed architecture. Different performance metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, relevance, latency are used to validate the proposed approach. The results presented in this research reveal that the performance of the proposed system is much more relevant compared to agentic RAG system. For context and intent specific applications proposed framework suits well.},

  abstract={Individually reinforcing the robustness of a single deep learning model only gives limited security guarantees especially when facing adversarial examples. In this article, we propose DeSVig, a decentralized swift vigilance framework to identify adversarial attacks in an industrial artificial intelligence systems (IAISs), which enables IAISs to correct the mistake in a few seconds. The DeSVig is highly decentralized, which improves the effectiveness of recognizing abnormal inputs. We try to overcome the challenges on ultralow latency caused by dynamics in industries using peculiarly designated mobile edge computing and generative adversarial networks. The most important advantage of our work is that it can significantly reduce the failure risks of being deceived by adversarial examples, which is critical for safety-prioritized and delay-sensitive environments. In our experiments, adversarial examples of industrial electronic components are generated by several classical attacking models. Experimental results demonstrate that the DeSVig is more robust, efficient, and scalable than some state-of-art defenses.},

  abstract={The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in visual art creation has unlocked new dimensions in creativity, automation, and personalized artistic expression. Conventional methods of generating art—typically based on rule-based systems or fixed templates—fail to engage the complexity, emotional depth, and stylistic variety that typify contemporary works of art. These existing drawbacks commonly lead to stiff and dull outputs that never manage to express rich artistic intent. To solve this aforementioned drawback, the current research investigates a hybrid AI strategy that exploits the strengths of StyleGAN and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. In the suggested framework StyleGAN, is utilized to produce high-resolution and visually appealing visual artworks through training with a curated collection of classical and modern works. The latent vectors from the output are further analyzed by LSTM networks to add sequential and thematic aspects, adding contextual and emotional richness to the created work of art. The system was strictly tested using both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The system attained an FID score of 8.2 and a user satisfaction rate of 96% and has proven effective in creating visually engaging and emotionally appealing AI-generated pieces of art.},

  year={2025},
  volume={13},

  pages={128959-128973},
  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools are rapidly transforming mathematics education by enabling automated problem generation, dynamic visualizations, and adaptive learning experiences. This study presents an empirical study on incorporating MATH41 into a 15-week pre-service teacher preparation course for mathematics majors. Twenty-four participants learned to create parameterized math problems, generate vector graphics. Following guided training, each participant designed and micro-taught a 20-minute lesson incorporating MATH41-generated resources. Reflection journals and final lesson plans were analyzed thematically, while 20 participants completed a self-assessment survey on lesson design competency. Results reveal that the automated problem generation capabilities motivated pre-service teachers to explore a broader range of instructional strategies, including personalized tasks and diverse problem variants. Reflection data indicate that while integrating AI tools can significantly boost confidence and creativity in lesson planning, careful pedagogical alignment remains essential to avoid superficial learning. Participants underscored the importance of maintaining teacher oversight—especially when adapting AI-generated problems for particular learner needs. Additionally, their post-course self-assessments showed high confidence in digital tool integration, yet they acknowledged that anticipating student misconceptions requires further field experience. Overall, this study contributes to understanding how teacher education programs can enhance lesson design competencies via structured AI tool integration. It also highlights the critical role of reflective practice in ensuring that automated content creation fosters deeper instructional effectiveness rather than uncritical AI dependency.},

Utilizing multi-modal remote sensing data and geographic information, this research proposes a deep learning framework to accurately classify and segment urban functional areas. The proposed method leverages a Transformer-based Spatio-Temporal Fusion Network (TBST) that integrates high-resolution satellite imagery and time-series population data. The TBST model comprises two feature extraction branches, ResMixer and PDNet, which respectively handle spatial and temporal features, followed by a Transformer-based adaptive fusion layer to enhance the extraction of informal settlements in urban areas. Experimental results demonstrate that the multimodal data fusion significantly improves the accuracy of urban functional area classification, achieving superior performance metrics compared to single-modal approaches. This method holds significant potential for advancing smart city planning by providing precise and up-to-date spatial distribution information, thus supporting urban policy-making and sustainable development.},

  abstract={Recently, with the advent of the Internet of everything and 5G network, the amount of data generated by various edge scenarios such as autonomous vehicles, smart industry, 4K/8K, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), etc., has greatly exploded. All these trends significantly brought real-time, hardware dependence, low power consumption, and security requirements to the facilities, and rapidly popularized edge computing. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI) workloads also changed the computing paradigm from cloud services to mobile applications dramatically. Different from wide deployment and sufficient study of AI in the cloud or mobile platforms, AI workload performance and their resource impact on edges have not been well understood yet. There lacks an in-depth analysis and comparison of their advantages, limitations, performance, and resource consumptions in an edge environment. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive study of representative AI workloads on edge platforms. We first conduct a summary of modern edge hardware and popular AI workloads. Then we quantitatively evaluate three categories (i.e., classification, image-to-image, and segmentation) of the most popular and widely used AI applications in realistic edge environments based on Raspberry Pi, Nvidia TX2, etc. We find that interaction between hardware and neural network models incurs non-negligible impact and overhead on AI workloads at edges. Our experiments show that performance variation and difference in resource footprint limit availability of certain types of workloads and their algorithms for edge platforms, and users need to select appropriate workload, model, and algorithm based on requirements and characteristics of edge environments.},

  abstract={Fuzzing is a popular technique for finding soft-ware vulnerabilities. Despite their success, the state-of-art fuzzers will inevitably produce a large number of low-quality inputs. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) based selection strategies have reported promising results. However, the existing ML-based fuzzers are limited by the lack of training data. Because the mutation strategy of fuzzing can not effectively generate useful input, it is prohibitively expensive to collect enough inputs to train models. In this paper, propose a generative adversarial networks based solution to generate a large number of inputs to solve the problem of insufficient data. We implement the proposal in the American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), and the experimental results show that it can find more crashes at the same time compared with the original AFL.},

  abstract={Introduction: The intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and design is gaining significant attention among professional communication researchers. Although challenges in designing with and for AI have been generally investigated, current systematic literature reviews have neglected to consider the tensions between AI and human designers during design work and how that work is impacted. Our study extends previous work by offering a more nuanced understanding of how AI affects designers’ work, thought processes, and solutions. Research methodology: Using the PRISMA framework, we conducted a systematic review of 44 articles specifically addressing tensions between human designers and AI in design work. We employed a hybrid inductive/deductive thematic analysis approach, using Miro for remote qualitative analysis. Results and discussion: Our thematic analysis reveals four main themes that encapsulate the multifaceted impact of AI on design practice: 1. reframing design roles and work, 2. human-AI-(human) interaction and collaboration, 3. cognitive expansion and critical reflection, and 4. limitations and risks of AI. These themes collectively offer insights into the multifaceted nature of AI’s impact on human designers in this new paradigm of practice. Conclusions and further research: This review has significant implications for researchers and practitioners in design. It reflects the current complexities of integrating AI into design processes while preserving human creativity, intuition, and agency. We further identify research gaps and suggest directions for future research and practice in design domains.},

  abstract={From the past few years, Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have gained more and more interest of researchers of Artificial Intelligence and this is only due to the reliability on huge amount of data, well designed network architectures and smart training techniques because of which they produce highly realistic pieces of content of images, texts and sounds. The inspirational idea of working in GANs has been derived from game theory, named as the zero-sum game. GANs consist of two components-a generator as well as a discriminator both of which act like two players of the game playing in opposition with each other. This paper focuses on the basic theory and principle mechanism of GANs. Next, the paper discusses few variants based on architecture as well as loss functions of some kinds. Finally, the last section of paper presents few other variants of GANs which are implemented in the field of computer vision and other real world problems. It is found that this area has a wider scope in terms of virtual real interaction and integration along with parallel learning. So it is considered as new implementation area for GANs in the coming future.},

  year={2025},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={As artificial intelligence tools like GitHub Copilot become more integrated into software development workflows, they are transforming how architects approach modern software design. Although enterprises are exploring the potential of GenAl tools to improve developer productivity, limited research exists on their impact on the role of software architects. Traditionally, architects use various tools to create architectural blueprints, including Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, use case diagrams, component diagrams, deployment diagrams, activity diagrams, and state diagrams, to name a few. Many of these diagrams follow repetitive patterns that could be automated with well-defined contexts. This paper examines Copilot's role in supporting architects through various stages of architectural development, evaluating how closely Copilot-generated outputs align with established architectural principles. By analyzing deviations, the study discusses how refined prompts can yield more accurate results. This research ultimately seeks to determine Copilot's potential to enhance productivity, ensure consistency, and support architectural decision-making, while offering insights into best practices for integrating AI into modern software architecture.},

  year={2023},

  pages={226-229},
  abstract={Synthesis of digital artifacts conditioned on user prompts has become an important paradigm facilitating an explosion of use cases with generative AI. However, such models often fail to connect the generated outputs and desired target concepts/preferences implied by the prompts. Current research addressing this limitation has largely focused on enhancing the prompts before output generation or improving the model’s performance up front. In contrast, this paper conceptualizes prompt evolution, imparting evolutionary selection pressure and variation during the generative process to produce multiple outputs that satisfy the target concepts/preferences better. We propose a multi-objective instantiation of this broader idea that uses a multi-label image classifier-guided approach. The predicted labels from the classifiers serve as multiple objectives to optimize, with the aim of producing diversified images that meet user preferences. A novelty of our evolutionary algorithm is that the pre-trained generative model gives us implicit mutation operations, leveraging the model’s stochastic generative capability to automate the creation of Pareto-optimized images more faithful to user preferences.},

  pages={891-895},
  abstract={In this paper, NUTRIC AI is explained as a cutting-edge AI-assisted personal nutrition advisory system that provides personalized dietary guidelines through the review of individual clinical histories, current medical records, and AI-assisted meal planning. Real-time food recognition is performed by the system via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Forecasting of Dietary Patterns is achieved using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks on past records of health information. Generative Networks are utilized to design personalized meal plans as per the specified dietary needs. For transparency and user confidence induction, the system utilizes Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, i.e., SHAP, to incorporate interpretability in its recommendations. Experimental trials depict substantial gains at a 95% accurate meal planning rate and a 92% user acceptance rate, better than existing available nutrition management platforms. The real-time food scoring system, user-specific dietary advice tailored to a user's own health record, and AI-facilitated chatbot interface are the distinguishing strengths of NUTRIC AI. The convergence of these three features places NUTRIC AI at the forefront of the art of personalized nutritional management.},

These threats pose risks at individual, organizational, and societal levels. This article examines the systemic impact of these cyber threats and proposes a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy that integrates AI-driven solutions, such as intrusion detection systems (IDS), with targeted policy interventions. By combining technological and regulatory measures, we create a multilevel defense capable of addressing both direct threats and indirect negative externalities. We emphasize that the synergy between AI-driven solutions and policy interventions is essential for neutralizing cyber threats and mitigating their negative impact on the digital economy. Finally, we underscore the need for continuous adaptation of these strategies, especially in response to the rapid advancement of autonomous AI-driven attacks, to ensure the creation of secure and resilient digital ecosystems.},

  year={2024},

  number={},
  pages={1599-1614},
  abstract={Software assistants have significantly impacted software development for both practitioners and students, particularly in capstone projects. The effectiveness of these tools varies based on their knowledge sources; assistants with localized domain-specific knowledge may have limitations, while tools, such as ChatGPT, using broad datasets, might offer recommendations that do not always match the specific objectives of a capstone course. Addressing a gap in current educational technology, this article introduces an AI Knowledge Assistant specifically designed to overcome the limitations of the existing tools by enhancing the quality and relevance of large language models (LLMs). It achieves this through the innovative integration of contextual knowledge from a local “lessons learned” database tailored to the capstone course. We conducted a study with 150 students using the assistant during their capstone course. Integrated into the Kanban project tracking system, the assistant offered recommendations using different strategies: direct searches in the lessons learned database, direct queries to a generative pretrained transformers (GPT) model, query enrichment with lessons learned before submission to GPT and large language model meta AI (LLaMa) models, and query enhancement with Stack Overflow data before GPT processing. Survey results underscored a strong preference among students for direct LLM queries and those enriched with local repository insights, highlighting the assistant's practical value. Furthermore, our linguistic analysis conclusively demonstrated that texts generated by the LLM closely mirrored the linguistic standards and topical relevance of university course requirements. This alignment not only fosters a deeper understanding of course content but also significantly enhances the material's applicability to real-world scenarios.},

  abstract={The unsupervised image translation is the core task of computer image processing, spanning a variety of real-world application scenarios, and constitutes an important branch of computer vision research orientations. In image translation tasks with significant geometric variations, conventional image translation algorithms have led to the generation of low-quality images due to unstable training. To address this matter, this paper proposes an unsupervised image translation method that combines a Self-Attention module. Specifically, first, the proposed model constructs the Generative Self-Attention Module and embeds it between the residual blocks and up-sampling in the generator, while inserting it in the discriminator before down-sampling. Then, the number of residual blocks is modified. Finally, a residual attention mechanism is introduced in the discriminator, which helps to propagate the features further. In particular, the model enhances the ability of the generator to extract deeper features at the central pixels, further improving the ability to transform the spatial details of the image and guiding the generator to generate more realistic images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model has preferable superiority and performance to the existing unsupervised image translation models.},

Addressing the issues in traditional word clouds, semantic word clouds have been developed but they are technically challenging to develop and still problematic. However, generative AI has the potential to develop efficient, accurate, creative, and accessible word clouds. Three different methods representing three major approaches of word cloud generation were developed, implemented, and user evaluated—traditional (baseline), semantic (natural language processing enhanced), and generative AI (generative pretrained transformer based)—in two different language contexts—Chinese (China case) and English (Singapore case). The findings of the study show the technical robustness of the methods, as well as provide key pedagogical insights from the user perspective of instructors of higher education courses in China and Singapore. Implications to the design of word clouds and their application in teaching and learning are discussed.},

  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a revolutionary innovation in machine learning that enables the generation of artificial data. Artificial data synthesis is valuable especially in the medical field where it is difficult to collect and annotate real data due to privacy issues, limited access to experts, and cost. While adversarial training has led to significant breakthroughs in the computer vision field, biomedical research has not yet fully exploited the capabilities of generative models for data generation, and for more complex tasks such as biosignal modality transfer. We present a broad analysis on adversarial learning on biosignal data. Our study is the first in the machine learning community to focus on synthesizing 1D biosignal data using adversarial models. We consider three types of deep generative adversarial networks: a classical GAN, an adversarial AE, and a modality transfer GAN; individually designed for biosignal synthesis and modality transfer purposes. We evaluate these methods on multiple datasets for different biosignal modalites, including phonocardiogram (PCG), electrocardiogram (ECG), vectorcardiogram and 12-lead electrocardiogram. We follow subject-independent evaluation protocols, by evaluating the proposed models' performance on completely unseen data to demonstrate generalizability. We achieve superior results in generating biosignals, specifically in conditional generation, by synthesizing realistic samples while preserving domain-relevant characteristics. We also demonstrate insightful results in biosignal modality transfer that can generate expanded representations from fewer input-leads, ultimately making the clinical monitoring setting more convenient for the patient. Furthermore our longer duration ECGs generated, maintain clear ECG rhythmic regions, which has been proven using ad-hoc segmentation models.},

In this paper, we present a novel capsule based conditional generative adversarial network that can automatically synthesize the image with realistic and aesthetically pleasing effect from a given image. By designing the capsule blocks in both the generator and discriminator and a novel multi-way optimization function, our framework can generate more realistic images than other frameworks. For the specific application, effect rendering, an effective line preservation loss is well designed and helps the framework to focus the synthesis of the texture around the lines, which not only improves the local line visual effect, but also enhance the global lighting effect around the lines. The experiments show that our improvement is effective and provides significant help to the overall framework. Our framework is tested on the effect rendering dataset and we compare our approach with multiple state-of-the-art methods. We achieved the best results.},

  abstract={Design thinking (DT), widely recognized as a structured method for fostering creativity and innovation, has gained significant traction in research and practice across various disciplines. However, with the rise of disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), DT practices are gradually evolving, reshaping the innovation process. This study investigates the effectiveness of integrating generative AI into a product design thinking activity, employing a single-group pretest-posttest design (i.e., without a control group). The time interval between pretest and posttest measurements was four hours, coinciding with the duration of the DT activity. Conducted in a chemical engineering course at a private university in central Mexico, the research tasked nine students of average academic performance with designing a new beverage. Over a four-hour session, students used AI tools-ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini-at various stages of the design process, including empathy mapping, need statements, idea classification, hills writing, and storyboarding. Several multidimensional constructs were measured using self-report questionnaires to assess the key attributes that DT stimulates: perceptions of creative self-efficacy, design thinking mindset, and empathy. Additionally, the study explored students' views on the usefulness of generative AI and their intention to use such tools. It was hypothesized that post-test scores for each construct would increase. The analysis involved two phases: first, psychometric indicators (alpha reliability) were obtained; second, a statistical approach for assessing individual change was applied, precisely the standardized individual difference (SID). The SID was set at a nominal level of 0.80 (right tail of the normal distribution). Scores with unacceptable measurement error (alpha <. 60) were excluded from the primary analysis. The results revealed a significant increase in students' perceived usefulness of AI between pre- and post-experiment measurements, with a moderate improvement in affective empathy. Other constructs also showed consistent, though modest, post-test score increases. However, only a few participants exceeded the SID threshold, indicating individual variations in response to the intervention. These preliminary findings highlight AI's potential to enhance student creativity through idea generation and expand their consideration of the end user in product design. The results provide valuable insights and recommendations for integrating AI into innovation-driven projects using the design thinking approach and implementing a single-group pretest-posttest design with short time intervals.},

  abstract={Current technological advancements in Information Technology are closely linked to Generative Artificial Intelligence, enabling the automation of complex tasks such as generating documents, images, videos, audio, and actions. As such tasks can save much human labor and resources, diverse industries are trying to adopt this technology. However, developing a product utilizing Generative AI is a challenging task, partly because it is a new technology and many users are not familiar with it yet. This paper’s primary goal is to find a better way to design Generative AI systems, especially from the Human-Computer Interaction perspective. To begin, we propose a taxonomy for Generative AI systems based on their modality, such as text-based, image-based, audio-based, and multi-modal-based systems, and then evaluate them in terms of their usability, because their functionalities should be aligned with the User Interface (UI), leading to a better User Experience (UX). We survey important trends in this area and introduce future applications by touching upon the issue of explainable AI. Although Generative AI has a bright future, it faces formidable challenges in our industries and society. It is hoped that the taxonomy and research findings presented here will be a useful framework for future research in Generative AI systems and their UI/UX.},

  abstract={Tropical cyclones (TCs) that develop in the Arabian Sea or the Bay of Bengal pose a serious threat to the North Indian Ocean (NIO). The main agency in charge of monitoring tropical cyclones in the NIO is the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which also offers early warnings in accordance with the TC’s Intensity. The present paper has addressed the state of intensity estimation for thermal currents (TCs) worldwide, with a focus on the NIO region. Conventionally, the Dvorak technique and its various versions are being used for satellite images to detect the intensity of TCs manually; however, a lot of efforts have been invested to develop artificial intelligence based alternatives for this. The paper examines the importance of Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) for estimating the intensity of TCs and their advantages over satellite images. The performance of the current IMD system is also highlighted in this paper. The average annual absolute intensity forecast skill for TCs in the period of 2013 to 2023 has been reported to be 74.95%. Further, the paper outlines existing challenges in the present system of intensity estimation for TCs. Finally, the paper outlines future research directions and underscores the critical need for an efficient artificial intelligence-based system for better intensity estimation of TCs.},

  abstract={As an essential resource in High Mountain Regions (HMR), evaluating the glacial lake dynamics is of great significance to explore the impacts of climate changes and predict the risks of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs). However, complicated and laborious methods for glacial lake mapping are unpractically applied in automatically monitoring glacial lakes at a large-scale region. In this work, we explored the mapping efficiency of glacial lakes by combing Generative Adversarial Networks and multi-level feature pyramid (GANMFP) in HMR. We first sampled the image patches containing glacial lakes from Landsat-8 raw data to evaluate the model performance. Totally, 6583 patches with 256x256x7 pixels are randomly cropped from 62 Landsat-8 images. Then we employed these data to train and test the GAN model, which integrated a multi-level feature fusion module in generator and a Resnet-152 networks in discriminator. From the validation results and result visualization, our method achieved good performances in Precision (88.42), Recall (59.61), and Overall Accuracy (99.28), which shows excellent potential in glacial lake mapping at a large-scale region.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of deep learning technology, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved significant results in the field of image generation. However, traditional GAN models are often seen as “black boxes,” with their internal decision-making processes lacking transparency. This limits their trustworthiness and controllability in practical applications. This study addresses the needs for generating and transferring exhibition hall design styles by proposing a deep learning model that combines Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technology and a user preference adaptation system. By introducing an attention mechanism to design interpretability modules, the transparency of the generation process is enhanced. A personalized user input interface is developed, enabling controllability and flexibility in style generation. Moreover, a multimodal information fusion method is employed to improve the accuracy of text-to-image generation. The experimental results show that the improved model not only enhances user trust and satisfaction with the generated results but also demonstrates high accuracy and diversity in the tasks of generating and transferring exhibition hall design styles.},

  abstract={With the advancement of medical technology, it is now crucial to diagnose illnesses using medical imaging. From one end of the network to the other, medical pictures frequently travel across its branches. High-level security is therefore necessary. Unauthorised usage of the image's data causes issues. One of the most efficient approaches in this area is encryption, which is one of the strategies used to protect the data in the picture. Here, we focus on two key steps: confusion and dispersion. The deep neural network is modified by the amount of weight that has the most impact on the output, whether it be an intermediate result or an elimination output, in addition to an unorganised structure that is undetected utilising deep neural network techniques. The proposed method used colour and greyscale images by segmenting them according to the Region of Interest of the deep neural network algorithm. In order to randomly construct an unpredictable structure that involved the addition or deletion of columns and as well as the rows, the method was then utilised to randomly distribute the pixels inside the designated region and generate random integers. To demonstrate the value of the suggested approach, the suggested algorithm is assessed in a number of ways and contrasted with the current approaches. The model number of changing pixel rate (NPCR) provides a 99.62 value.},

Drawing on the ICAP framework theory, this paper conducts an empirical study using the generative AI tool Wenxin Yiyan. This study involved 32 pre-service teachers majoring in Educational Technology, each submitting an instructional design for basic IT instruction in elementary schools, both before and after the application of generative AI. After the experiment, a questionnaire survey was conducted to obtain feedback from pre-service teachers on their use of generative AI. The collected data were analyzed using paired T-tests and cognitive network analysis. The results showed that generative AI assistance significantly improved the quality of teaching design plans and enhanced the teaching design capabilities of pre-service teachers. Moreover, pre-service teachers of different performance levels demonstrated distinct cognitive network characteristics when using generative AI assistance.},

  abstract={Brain stroke is causing severe damage to health besides causingdeaths across the globe. Healthcare industry has got technological innovations to improve quality of service. With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) medical image analysis has unprecedented possibilities. Deep learning approaches have gained popularity for analysing medical images for automatic diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning models such as VGG16, ResNet50 and DenseNet121 are found to be suitable for image processing. However, as one size does not fit all, there is need for optimizing these models in order to adapt them for brain stroke detection and leverage their performance. Towards this end, in this paper, we proposed an AI enabled framework with optimizations to the aforementioned deep models. Towards this end we proposed an algorithm known as Intelligent Learning for Stroke Detection (ILSD). The optimized models are found to have increased prediction performance. Enhanced DenseNet121 showed highest accuracy with 99.82%.},

This study investigates how advanced AI techniques, such as deep learning and neural networks, can automate the assessment of the cardiothoracic ratio, a crucial indicator for identifying heart diseases. AI uses huge records and complicated formulas to make medical findings better, faster, and more consistent, so humans don't have to look them over as often. The study also examines the challenges that arise from combining AI, such as inaccurate data and errors, and emphasizes the importance of conducting comprehensive reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these AI-powered solutions.

  abstract={While current research predominantly focuses on image-based colorization, the domain of video-based colorization remains relatively unexplored. Many existing video colorization techniques operate frame-by-frame, often overlooking the critical aspect of temporal coherence between successive frames. This approach can result in inconsistencies across frames, leading to undesirable effects like flickering or abrupt color transitions between frames. To address these challenges, we combine the generative capabilities of a fine-tuned latent diffusion model with an autoregressive conditioning mechanism to ensure temporal consistency in automatic speaker video colorization. We demonstrate strong improvements on established quality metrics compared to existing methods, namely, PSNR, SSIM, FID, FVD, NIQE and BRISQUE. Specifically, we achieve an 18% improvement in performance when FVD is employed as the evaluation metric. Furthermore, we performed a subjective study, where users preferred LatentColorization to the existing state-of-the-art DeOldify 80% of the time. Our dataset combines conventional datasets and videos from television/movies. A short demonstration of our results can be seen in some example videos available at https://youtu.be/vDbzsZdFuxM.},

  abstract={Generative AI offers innovative opportunities for the digital development of LEGO education and poses the dual challenges of technological ethics and the nature of education. This study explores the core application scenarios of generative AI in the development of LEGO digital learning resources, which significantly improves the efficiency and creative boundaries of educational resource development. Generative AI significantly improves the development efficiency and creative boundaries of digital learning resources by rapidly generating LEGO model prototypes and assisting interdisciplinary curriculum design. At the same time, it dynamically adjusts task difficulty and provides real-time feedback by analyzing student behavioral data, enabling truly personalized learning support. These applications lower the threshold of innovation, expand educational possibilities, and promote the construction of a sustainable education ecosystem by optimizing the reuse of resources. However, this convergence also poses key techno-ethical risks, including data bias, privacy concerns arising from excessive data collection from children, and homogenization of creativity due to AI “best solution” algorithms. To address this issue, we propose a two-track evaluation mechanism for “ethical education” that defines the boundaries of human-computer collaboration, and emphasizes the need for shared social responsibility to ensure positive empowerment in the generation of AI. Future research directions include deepening multi-sensory learning experiences that combine reality with reality, and further exploring synergistic development paths between technology and human-centered education.},

  pages={22928-22937},
  abstract={This study aims to explore the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in art education, assessing its impact on learners’ experiences and learning outcomes. The study first proposes a digital teaching system that enables the IoT and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to play a role in art education by monitoring students’ creative state in real-time, providing immediate feedback, and facilitating the generation of creative works. The system framework includes sensor nodes, an IoT platform, a GAN model, and a user interface to build a real-time interactive environment. Sensor nodes constantly collect physiological, movement, and environmental data from students, and the GAN model receives student data from the IoT platform, combining creative input from students to generate artwork in real-time. The generated works are transmitted to the discriminator through the IoT platform, which evaluates their quality and provides real-time feedback. Students interact with the system through the user interface, observe the generated artwork, adjust generator parameters, and propose new ideas. These interactions influence further artistic creation. The WikiArt public art creation dataset is selected to establish the experimental foundation, and the experimental evaluation focuses on image generation quality, system performance, and student learning outcomes. It is compared with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models. The research results indicate that the designed IoT and GANs integrated system remarkably outperforms DCGAN and VAE in image generation quality, with an Inception Score of 4.5, which is more diverse and recognizable than other models. Regarding system performance, the IoT and GANs integrated system is significantly ahead in image generation speed and user interaction, with a transmission speed of up to 200 Mbps. Regarding student learning outcomes, the system performs excellently in emotional feedback, learning outcomes, and creative work quality, achieving 80% satisfaction and 90% positive feedback. Overall, the research conclusion clearly points out that the integration of IoT and GANs has a significant and comprehensive effect on improving the quality of art education. This study expands the field of art education by integrating IoT and GANs, enhancing students’ creative experiences, and providing innovative methods for art teaching in the digital age.},

Current safety management systems in CSCs are often reactive and limited in scope, failing to address safety concerns in inter-organizational complexities. Therefore, we explore how generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) can revolutionize safety management in CSCs by providing proactive monitoring, predictive analysis, and enhanced training. Nevertheless, integrating this technology requires addressing technical, data security, operational, trust, and ethical issues. Future research and practices should focus on overcoming these barriers to harness Gen AI's potential for enhancing safety in CSCs.},

  abstract={With the release of ChatGPT, Pandora’s box of generative AI has been opened and the new technology is here to stay. This also impacts academic education, where it provides new opportunities while also bearing certain challenges. Students and educators alike will have to adapt to the newly available technology and find ways to use it in a meaningful and profitable way. Summarized, this means that both parties need to develop media competence in using generative AI on their end in academic education. New ways of learning and teaching are required, as well as a change in how educators grade the students’ learning status. While the latter should be made aware of the opportunities that generative AI provides them with, educators should actively make use of it in their courses in order to enhance their teaching.},

  abstract={In recent years, the deep learning, and artificial intelligence, have advanced rapidly and make significant breakthroughs with the help of generative architectures. In general, these are broadly broken down into either Text to image (T2I) architectures or Large Language Models (LLMs). Generating AI has been broadly explored in most domains, but the detection of long tailed is undeveloped. The scarcity of data for tail classes becomes the key challenge among its shortage in long-tailed image classification, and thus poor generalization tends to occur. To address this issue, traditional methods make use of constructive learning, mix based augmentation, re weighting, and resampling. But still, all these techniques do not generalize well to the representations of tail classes for data imbalance. In order to tackle the limitations of it, this research develops a hybrid generative learning model with synthetic data augmentation, contrastive learning, and adaptive label correction for improving long tailed image detection. The architecture takes advantage of T2I models to create synthetic data that is then refined via mix-based augmentation (MixUP and CutMix) and processed through Contrastive learning base encoder. The meaningful representations are extracted using a ResNet backbone and the model generalization is improved using supervised contrastive learning (SCL). Moreover, there is a label correction module which dynamically identifies low quality synthetic labels using KNN method, providing data integrity. The proposed method is also demonstrated to significantly improve the classification accuracy for the tail classes, and to outperform conventional techniques. Generative AI is shown to promise to fill the gap between synthetically and real-life data and make robust long tailed image classification possible with an adaptive and correcting nature.},

  abstract={Engineering education is constantly evolving to keep up with the latest technological developments and meet the changing needs of the engineering industry. One promising development in this field is the use of generative artificial intelligence technology, such as the ChatGPT conversational agent. ChatGPT has the potential to offer personalized and effective learning experiences by providing students with customized feedback and explanations, as well as creating realistic virtual simulations for hands-on learning. However, it is important to also consider the limitations of this technology. ChatGPT and other generative AI systems are only as good as their training data and may perpetuate biases or even generate and spread misinformation. Additionally, the use of generative AI in education raises ethical concerns such as the potential for unethical or dishonest use by students and the potential unemployment of humans who are made redundant by technology. While the current state of generative AI technology represented by ChatGPT is impressive but flawed, it is only a preview of what is to come. It is important for engineering educators to understand the implications of this technology and study how to adapt the engineering education ecosystem to ensure that the next generation of engineers can take advantage of the benefits offered by generative AI while minimizing any negative consequences.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a critical role in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) as urban areas grow by processing data for safety enhancements, predictive analysis, and traffic management. This results in better traffic control, lower emissions, and preventative actions to lessen the effects of accidents. Despite these developments, there isn’t a thorough academic analysis that covers a variety of optimization strategies for transportation AI models. By presenting an in-depth analysis of AI optimization methods and their uses in ITSs, this work seeks to close this knowledge gap and give academics important new information on possible directions for future research. Model-based optimization approaches, reinforcement learning techniques, model-predictive control techniques, and generative AI techniques are the four areas into which this study divides AI optimization techniques for the sake of structure, clarity, and comparative analysis. Subcategories of optimization techniques and their corresponding applications are explored, and each category is thoroughly addressed. Researchers will be better able to comprehend the state of AI optimization for transportation management today and in the future thanks to this methodical methodology.

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={AI facial recognition for real-time emotion detection in online learning environments intends to analyze students’ sentiments throughout online classes, recognizing emotions such as focused, neutral, distracted, enraged, thrilled, or dissatisfied states. The proposed approach uses a generative model trained by conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) to accomplish De-expression Residue Learning (DeRL), a facial expression recognition technique. DeRL prioritizes gathering residue for delicate emotion recognition by filtering expressive material and storing it in intermediary layers. This technology gives educators and researchers real-time insights into students’ emotional states, allowing for a more thorough understanding of collective student involvement through the lens of socially shared control of learning. Experiments on seven facial expression databases, including two pre-training datasets, indicate that DeRL outperforms other methods in accurately recognizing and classifying students’ emotions. The findings emphasize its ability to capture subtle feelings during online learning. The discussion dives into theoretical and practical implications, highlighting AI’s potential to enhance the evaluation of student participation in online learning environments. The study concludes by providing relevant information for building tailored learning experiences, indicating a possible avenue for incorporating AI in the classroom.},

As a result, jobs that are repetitive, predictable, and don't require deep human intuition are at the highest risk of being affected. Customer service representative is a job that faces one of the highest risks of becoming redundant thanks to GenAI. While GenAI can automate code writing for certain tasks, software development is also about problem&#x2010;solving, design, and understanding human needs &#x2013; areas where humans excel.

  abstract={Concerns regarding energy use, environmental effects, and long-term sustainability have been highlighted in recent years by the expanding application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare. This systematic review paper categorizes and classifies AI algorithms and tools in the healthcare sector to support more sustainable practices, focusing on reducing energy use while maintaining high standards in diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. AI algorithms and tools are categorized into three groups: explicit AI algorithms for sustainability for energy efficiency (e.g., Federated Learning, Hybrid Quantum-Classical Optimization, Modified Lempel-Ziv-Welch (mLZW)), traditional AI algorithms for sustainable healthcare (e.g., Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Backpropagation Neural Networks (BPNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)), and sustainable AI techniques (e.g., Adaptive Sampling, AutoML for Model Compression (AMC)) that support low-power computing (e.g., edge computing, neuromorphic hardware, adaptive sampling). A comprehensive performance analysis is presented across five dimensions: energy consumption, latency, accuracy, complexity, and cost. The review highlights mLZW as promising for energy efficiency, complexity, and cost, OFA for low-latency deployment, and Hybrid Quantum Classical Optimization for diagnostic accuracy. We propose an integration framework for deploying these methods in resource-constrained healthcare environments, identifying open research challenges and future directions. This work provides a foundational guide for researchers and sector practitioners to build energy-aware, high-performance AI systems in healthcare.},

From automatic recognition to automatic generation, data intelligent simulation can develop traditional image production techniques or processes, and efficiently reproduce images by pastiche. More efficient image productivity will increase innovative meaning and intelligent labor value of automated pastiche.

For instance, it has been widely used in financial areas such as stock market prediction, portfolio optimization, financial information processing, and trade execution strategies, etc. In this paper, we proposed a novel architecture of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for forecasting the price of houses. To train and evaluate our methodology. The dataset was House Sales in King County, USA, which includes several pings, floor or room age, etc. In the analysis of this input information, the network model will output the predicted house price.},

  abstract={To solve the problem that images reconstructed by traditional super-resolution reconstruction (SR) techniques are smooth and lack good details, in this paper, we have presented an improved generative adversarial network for image super-resolution. The improved method was based on deep neural networks whose generative model contained a multi-layer convolution module and multi-layer deconvolution module, in which a layer hopping connection and a loss function was added to the perceptual loss. The discriminant model was made up of a multi-layer neural network whose loss function was based on the discriminant model loss function that was generated from the generative adversarial network. Finally, we selected PSNR and SSIM as the indicator in the experiments. In the experiments, the PSNR value of 2x, 3x and 4x magnification factor are improved on average by 1.125, 2.175 and 2.075 respectively and the SSIM value of 2x, 3x and 4x magnification factor are basically improved. Compared with the existing image super-resolution reconstruction methods, the effectiveness of the method that we proposed in image super-resolution reconstruction was proven.},

  abstract={COVID-19 outbreak has put the whole world in an unprecedented difficult situation bringing life around the world to a frightening halt and claiming thousands of lives. Due to COVID-19's spread in 212 countries and territories and increasing numbers of infected cases and death tolls mounting to 5,212,172 and 334,915 (as of May 22 2020), it remains a real threat to the public health system. This paper renders a response to combat the virus through Artificial Intelligence (AI). Some Deep Learning (DL) methods have been illustrated to reach this goal, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and Long/Short Term Memory (LSTM). It delineates an integrated bioinformatics approach in which different aspects of information from a continuum of structured and unstructured data sources are put together to form the user-friendly platforms for physicians and researchers. The main advantage of these AI-based platforms is to accelerate the process of diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 disease. The most recent related publications and medical reports were investigated with the purpose of choosing inputs and targets of the network that could facilitate reaching a reliable Artificial Neural Network-based tool for challenges associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, there are some specific inputs for each platform, including various forms of the data, such as clinical data and medical imaging which can improve the performance of the introduced approaches toward the best responses in practical applications.},

  abstract={Adopting Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in software engineering represents a shift in how tasks like coding and idea generation are approached. This paper investigates uni-versity students' perceptions and expectations regarding the use of Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot in software engineering. To achieve this, we conducted a questionnaire study with volunteer participants studying at Uppsala University in Sweden, resulting in a total of 127 responses. These responses were about the usage preferences, motivations for adoption, per-ceived benefits, encountered challenges, and suggested improve-ment of these tools. The findings reveal that 16 % of participants have never used a Generative AI tool, while of those who have used such tools predominantly use ChatGPT3.5. Among users of Generative AI, respondents reported benefits such as code optimization and idea generation, alongside challenges such as inaccuracies in generated content and understanding user intent. Despite these challenges, participants perceive the integration of Generative AI tools as transformative for traditional software engineering practices. The results of this paper offer insights into the practical use of AI tools and suggestions for improving their functionality, thereby influencing the future direction of software engineering education.},

  year={2021},
  volume={41},
  number={1},
  pages={8-14},
  abstract={Public awareness and concern about climate change often do not match the magnitude of its threat to humans and our environment. One reason for this disagreement is that it is difficult to mentally simulate the effects of a process as complex as climate change and to have a concrete representation of the impact that our individual actions will have on our own future, especially if the consequences are long term and abstract. To overcome these challenges, we propose to use cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to develop an interactive personalized visualization tool, the AI climate impact visualizer. It will allow a user to enter an address—be it their house, their school, or their workplace—-and it will provide them with an AI-imagined possible visualization of the future of this location in 2050 following the detrimental effects of climate change such as floods, storms, and wildfires. This image will be accompanied by accessible information regarding the science behind climate change, i.e., why extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and what kinds of changes are happening on a local and global scale.},

  abstract={The main goal of this paper is to propose a framework to better understand and capitalize on the many implications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for education, especially but not limited to the most recent developments of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). Four complementary categories are identified, each presenting diverse opportunities and challenges:1)Leveraging AI to improve instruction: This involves using AI to create new and more powerful learning opportunities for learners – at all levels of schools and across subject areas as well as instructional contexts.2)Promoting AI Literacy: This involves helping everyone develop sufficient understanding of AI to function in a society where AI is increasingly used.3)Rethinking workforce preparation: This involves responding to the need to change how we prepare future workers, once uses of AI take over functions previously performed by humans in specific occupations.4)Leveraging AI to support educators’ own work: While the focus of the previous three categories is on student learning, here the focus shifts on educators’ using AI in their work to increase their productivity and well-being.In what follows, I will examine each of these areas using conceptual analysis, building on findings from relevant research studies I have been involved in, as well as recent conversations within an interdisciplinary group of faculty, staff and students as part of an internal planning grant for the University of Rochester. For each area, after a brief introduction I will identify and discuss a few key elements; selected illustrations, in most cases reporting findings from relevant research projects, will also be provided in separate “boxes” so they can be read independently.For further information about this paper please contact the author.},

  abstract={Sustainability, to describe it in simpler words, is a process of making things less bad. It is not a long-term solution even if it limits the destruction of the environment to a manageable level. Nevertheless, by just becoming sustainable, one cannot bring back what has been lost. The restoration approach is immediately required to fixing what has been broken by using renewable energy, reforestation and creating biodiversity gains. Redesigning our industrial system of production and consumption around the circular patterns of resource and energy use that we observe in mature ecosystems is a must and a complex endeavour. To create a truly regenerative economy challenges us to work with huge amounts of data. New techniques of data science and artificial intelligence are required in each step of the ecological design. This paper presents some examples of biomimicry in circular design and proposes techniques that integrate data science and artificial intelligence (AI) as tools to accelerate the transition towards the regenerative approach. AI, as an emergent `Fourth Industrial Revolution' technology, can support and accelerate the pace of human innovation to design the future urban developments, to enable innovation in cities. AI has the capability to create a step change, to support an effective economic system that is regenerative by design.},

  abstract={Since the early 2000s, the digital transformation of the National Museum of Korea has led to the creation of numerous digital data related to artifacts. When the initial digital cultural heritage data began to be accumulated, the focus was on ‘recording’ rather than ‘public disclosure’, so the data disclosed to the public was extremely small. In addition, unlike systematically managed cultural heritage, ‘replicated data’ in digital form is relatively unstructured in terms of creation, management, and storage. To systematize the many digital data that are piled up in a disorderly manner, a lot of manpower and cost must be invested, but there are limits to solving this with limited resources. This study proposes a standard for classifying cultural heritage data by introducing artificial intelligence technology to solve these problems, and further suggests ways to use digital data more creatively using artificial intelligence technology.},

  abstract={The continuous advancement in technology has restructured industries, due to innovations in Artificial Intelligence (AI) the financial sector endorsing astonishing transformations. This research recognizes the potential of AI in fintech for digital society while focusing on the transition toward Industry 5.0, which is based on human-AI collaboration. AI technologies, such as Artificial Generative Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), are limited in handling intricate, vigorous financial environments. ANI has improved efficiency via credit risk assessment, customer service automation, and fraud detection, whereas AGI aims for more comprehensive decision-making capabilities. ANI and AGI are creating a gap in accomplishing a truly responsive, customer-centric system as it cannot fully adapt to subtle decision-making or erratic market shifts. This paper suggests a Super Artificial Intelligence (SAl) as a promising solution to overcome limitations, standing SAI-based design for a unified nifty digital financial system. Its forward-thinking decision-making proficiencies, self-learning, and flexibility are expected to transmute financial aligned with Industry 5.0's human-centered principles by providing adaptive services, enhancing financial inclusion and personalized. The study identifies key challenges in current AI applications, through a comprehensive review of literature and case studies, such as algorithmic errors and customer facility, and highlights how SAI could offer a more autonomous and ethical approach to financial decision-making. The paper concludes by underscoring the importance of continuous AI validation, ethical considerations, and human oversight to ensure sustainable, secure, and customer-focused financial systems.},

  pages={200-211},
  abstract={The traffic data corrupted by noise and missing entries often lead to the poor performance of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), such as the bad congestion prediction and route guidance. How to efficiently impute the traffic data is an urgent problem. As a classic deep learning method, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) achieves remarkable success in image recovery fields, which opens up a new way for the traffic data imputation. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal GAN model for the traffic data imputation (STGAN). Firstly, we design the generative loss and center loss, which not only minimizes the reconstructed errors of the imputed entries, but also ensures each imputed entry and its neighbors conform to the local spatio-temporal distribution. Then, the discriminator uses the convolution neural network classifier to judge whether the imputed matrix conforms to the global spatio-temporal distribution. As for the network architecture of the generator, we introduce the skip-connection to keep all well preserved data unchanged, and employ the dilated convolution to capture the spatio-temporal correlation in the traffic data. The experimental results show that our proposed method obviously outperforms other competitive traffic data imputation methods.},

  abstract={This paper examines the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in creating digital twins of energy systems and conducting virtual stability tests. Through comparative and inductive analysis of existing literature and industry reports, we explore how AI-driven modeling can address limitations of traditional simulation methods in predicting complex energy system behavior. Key findings include the potential for machine learning algorithms to develop high-fidelity models, integration of big data to enhance simulation realism, and use of generative adversarial networks to simulate rare events. We propose strategies for optimizing energy systems based on virtual test results, including reinforcement learning for developing optimal control strategies. While AI-powered digital twins show promise for improving reliability and efficiency, challenges in model validation and standardization remain. This research highlights AI as a critical tool for advancing digital twin technology in the energy sector and enhancing grid resilience through virtual stability testing.},

  abstract={Data-driven methods based on artificial intelligence technology exhibit the ability to process data quickly and accurately, thus currently being widely applied in the field of power system state estimation (SE). However, recent studies have found that processing data during the training phase of data-driven algorithms can mislead the operational results, demonstrating security risks in data-driven methods. In light of this, to reveal potential security issues in data-driven algorithms, this paper proposes an adversarial attack method based on conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN). Experimental results indicate that adding minute disturbances generated by CGAN to target samples can misleads the predictions of SE model. This method directs the attack based on preset label conditions during the model application.},

  abstract={Recently, artificial intelligence is profoundly changing design practice. The relationship between designers and applied artificial intelligence urgently needs a framework and theory to describe and measure. Thus, this article establishes the Brain-Machine-Ratio (BMR) model, which examines the collaborative relationship between the designers and artificial intelligence with the ratio of human and machine labor in the process of design work. The core approach is modeling the proportion of human and AI in seven design tasks on the time dimension. Based on both qualitative and quantitative evaluation, we proposed the concept and statistics of the Brain-Machine-Ratio model and deduced the further collaborative relationship between designers and artificial intelligence.},

  title={A Multi-Model Framework for Synthesizing High-Fidelity Network Intrusion Data Using Generative AI}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The rapid evolution of network technologies and frequent network intrusions have amplified the demand for intrusion detection systems (IDSs) powered by artificial intelligence (AI). However, the performance of IDSs is limited by labeled intrusion data and class imbalances in existing datasets. Collecting such data through live network simulations is costly, insecure, and poses regulatory challenges. This paper presents a multi-model framework that uses a conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN) to synthesize realistic network intrusion data. The framework addresses challenges such as unstable training, mode collapse, and handling mixed data types, which are common in most generative AI models when applied to non-Gaussian tabular data generation while validating the synthesized data through qualitative and quantitative analyses. Overlaid density histograms and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) are used for qualitative analysis. For quantitative analysis, the train-real-test-synthetic (TRTS) and train-synthetic-test-real (TSTR) methods, as well as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, are utilized. The TRTS and TSTR methods are classifier-based approaches with classification accuracies of 98.36% and 97.95%, respectively, and are used to assess the synthesized intrusion data to ensure the interchangeability of the synthesized intrusion data and real-world intrusion data for training IDSs. The KS test results indicate a similarity score of 0.92 between real and synthesized data. Additionally, to provide interpretable insights into the performance of the model and refrain from using real-world intrusion data for analysis purposes, the framework employs an explainable AI (XAI) approach called local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME), enabling network security analysts to interpret features that influence the intrusive nature of the synthesized network intrusion data while preserving data privacy.},

  abstract={We present a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) system that functions as a designer assistant in augmented reality (AR) environments. Leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) like LLaVA and advanced text-to-3D generative models, users can capture images of their surroundings with an Augmented Reality (AR) headset. The system analyzes these images to recommend contextually relevant objects that enhance both functionality and visual appeal. The recommended objects are generated as 3D models and seamlessly integrated into the AR environment for interactive use. Our system utilizes open-source AI models running on local systems to enhance data security and reduce operational costs. Key features include context-aware object suggestions, optimal placement guidance, aesthetic matching, and an intuitive user interface for real-time interaction. Evaluations using the COCO 2017 dataset and real-world AR testing demonstrated high accuracy in object detection and contextual fit rating of 4.1 out of 5. By addressing the challenge of providing context-aware object recommendations in AR, our system expands the capabilities of AI applications in this domain. It enables users to create personalized digital spaces efficiently, leveraging AI for contextually relevant suggestions.},

  abstract={Latest developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data gave rise to Artificial Intelligent agents like Open AI’s ChatGPT, which has recently become the fastest-growing application since Facebook and WhatsApp. ChatGPT has demonstrated its ability to impact students’ classroom learning experience and exam outcomes. However, there is evidence that ChatGPT provides biased and erroneous information, yet students use ChatGPT in academic tasks. Therefore, an accurate understanding of ChatGPT user perception is crucial. This study has analyzed 247 Reddit top posts related to the educational use of ChatGPT from a prominent subreddit called "ChatGPT" for user perception analysis. Descriptive statistics, sentiment analysis using NLP techniques, and LDA topic modeling were used for analysis to gather a contextual understanding of the data. Results show that the majority of the users took a neutral viewpoint. However, there was more positive perception than negative regarding the usefulness of ChatGPT in education.},

  abstract={The success of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), has led to innovative applications and numerous attempts to find a use for this tool in different fields. One of these fields is in the work fielded by child protection offices. The AId4Children project investigates the use of AI-generated virtual reality (VR) training environments for child protection workers. This VR training application simulates home visits and is generated on synthetically constructed cases of child abuse and neglect that are based on real case files. Using real case files for AI-based generation of VR training raises several ethical, legal, and social aspects (ELSA) and questions. One question Q1) is how to acquire and create an open data set on child endangerment case files. A second question Q2) is how to represent the vulnerable characters in VR respectfully. A third question Q3) is if the use of AI, incl. LLM within the context of child abuse and neglect is acceptable at all. This paper will discuss and provide the first answers to the considerations on ELSA raised by the explorative concept development of this VR training application.},

  abstract={By integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) has revolutionized many fields. However, AIoT is facing the challenges of energy consumption and carbon emissions due to the continuous advancement of mobile technology. Fortunately, Generative AI (GAI) holds immense potential to reduce carbon emissions of AIoT due to its excellent reasoning and generation capabilities. In this article, we explore the potential of GAI for carbon emissions reduction and propose a novel GAI-enabled solution for low-carbon AIoT. Specifically, we first study the main impacts that cause carbon emissions in AIoT, and then introduce GAI techniques and their relations to carbon emissions. We then explore the application prospects of GAI in low-carbon AIoT, focusing on how GAI can reduce carbon emissions of network components. Subsequently, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled carbon emission optimization framework, in which we design pluggable LLM and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) modules to generate more accurate and reliable optimization problems. Furthermore, we utilize Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) to identify optimal strategies for carbon emission reduction. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, we insightfully provide open research directions for low-carbon AIoT.},
