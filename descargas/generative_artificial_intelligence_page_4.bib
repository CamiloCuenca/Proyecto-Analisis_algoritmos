  abstract={Brainstorming, originally conceived by Alex Osborn in 1953, is widely recognized as an effective tool for promoting creativity and innovation within teams. However, as technologies advance and new tools emerge, such as duels of generative artificial intelligence, the brainstorming landscape is evolving. This study aims to investigate the use of Chat GPT, DALL-E and Miro in brainstorming sessions in presence, to evaluate the user experience of users depending on the tool used and their influence on human group creativity. It was followed by a design of repeated measurements research, where each group of participants carried out in succession the three sessions of brainstorming with the help of different tools. The methodology used is mixed qualitative and quantitative, through three online surveys. The key indicators considered include the total number of ideas generated, the uniqueness and feasibility of the same, as well as the subjective perception of participants on the effectiveness of the brainstorming process. In conclusion, this study aims to provide meaningful information on the use of artificial intelligence tools to facilitate or not collaborative creative processes, offering progression for future research in artificial intelligence-assisted innovation.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a personalized learning system based on generative artificial intelligence, which aims to improve students' learning efficiency and interest through adaptive learning paths and content recommendations. The system integrates advanced artificial intelligence technologies such as GAN and VAE to achieve deep customization and dynamic adjustment of the learning process. First, the GAN model is used to generate personalized learning resources, including courseware, exercises and learning paths, which are dynamically adjusted according to students' knowledge mastery and learning styles. VAE is used to construct a latent space representation of students' learning status and further optimize the personalized recommendation of learning content. To verify the effectiveness of the system, this paper conducted many simulation experiments. By analyzing the learning behavior data of different student groups, the system's performance in personalized recommendation and learning progress adaptation was evaluated. The experimental results show that the personalized learning system based on generative artificial intelligence has significant advantages in improving students' learning effects, shortening learning time, and increasing learning participation. Specific data show that the recommendation accuracy of the system reaches 92%, the learning efficiency is improved by 15%, and the student satisfaction is 20% higher than the traditional learning model.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly driving a new phase of artificial intelligence revolution, marked by various applications such as ChatGPT, Sora and DeepSeek. With powerful capabilities in content generation, personalization and user interaction, GenAI can drive significant enhancements in various mobile services to satisfy individual user preferences. Meanwhile, mobile services offer substantial support for accessibility, functionality and intelligence of GenAI applications. However, current research on integrating GenAI and mobile services remains nascent, lacking necessary theoretical and technical support. In this survey, we break down a new vision to guide research on integrating GenAI and mobile services, aiming to improve 6G intelligence levels and enable 6G mobile networks to support the integration of GenAI and mobile services effectively. We begin by examining the necessity of integrating GenAI with 6G mobile services and exploring potential learning architectures of GenAI models within mobile networks. Next, we analyze potential solutions from two perspectives: how 6G mobile networks empower GenAI and how GenAI enables mobile services. We subsequently explore a promising use case, along with essential features and techniques, to facilitate the integration of GenAI and mobile services. Finally, we discuss future research directions, aiming at realizing intelligent 6G networks.},

  abstract={In the era of Artificial Intelligence and specifically in the sub-category of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenIA), the trend in the context of Data Centers is to be able to integrate traditional network architectures that are still managed as Ethernet networks with new ones. GenIA-based network structures that use low latency protocols such as InfiniBand and that allow parallel processing. In this work, a novel network architecture is presented that integrates the relevant aspects of Ethernet networks and the new GenIA Back End networks. We also deal with aspects related to protocols, bandwidth, design of a GenIA network architecture, components of GenIA networks and cooling systems. The main objective of this article is to analyze, through the Radial Basic Function (RBF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) algorithms, which are part of the scope of Neural Networks (NN), how the dependent variable or metric GPU Performance behaves, since it is one of the critical aspects in the middle of modern data center architectures. To achieve this, a series of independent variables are defined such as GPU Memory Access, Memory Bandwidth, Throughput, Power Consumption, Temperature, and Clock Speed. With the RBF algorithm, these sub-metrics are analyzed taking into consideration the number of units that may be in each of the hidden layers and the level of importance of the variable, while, with the MLP, the number of units established both in hidden layer 1 and 2, respectively, and the importance level and normalized importance to analyze the behavior of these sub-metrics. The latter is presented through case studies and helps to identify which metrics are more relevant than others in terms of operation, performance, and efficiency of GPU performance metrics.},

  abstract={This paper deals with data pseudonymization when using generative artificial intelligence, specifically ChatGPT. The aim of the research was to experimentally verify whether ChatGPT can maintain the protection of pseudonymized data by not maintaining the link between the anonymized part and personal data. Four requests were tested in the experiment, in which ChatGPT was gradually provided with various combinations of pseudonymized and complete data about customers and their orders. The results showed that ChatGPT does not store previous inputs and is not able to reconstruct personal data retroactively if they were not explicitly provided to it in each request. Based on the results obtained, it can be assumed that the use of ChatGPT when processing pseudonymized data does not pose a risk of violating the protection of personal data. This research seeks to contribute to the discussion on the security of generative artificial intelligence in processing sensitive data and confirms the effectiveness of pseudonymization as a mechanism for protecting personal data.},

  abstract={The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has increased drastically in recent years, offering transformative potential in creativity, productivity, and decision-making across various domains. However, concerns are growing among practitioners and academics about its tendency to produce inaccurate or nonsensical outputs—a phenomenon known as generative AI hallucinations. While scholars have begun exploring this phenomenon, most of the existing research focuses on technical issues and solutions. This research takes a behavioral approach to examine the association between individual personality traits and tolerance of generative AI hallucinations. Drawing on error management theory and the big five personality traits, we examine how individuals with different personality traits tolerate generative AI hallucinations. The study contributes to calls from management journals to investigate the challenges associated with generative AI use. Our findings provide important theoretical implications and offer actionable insights for engineering managers seeking to implement generative AI.},

  abstract={Over the past few decades, immersive technologies have completely transformed the world around us. Recent trends show that the next digital transformation will directly impact the way people live, communicate, work, trade and learn and will be powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Generative artificial intelligence has had to face significant higher education challenges since its appearance, requiring the development of new and innovative teaching and learning practices. Nevertheless, the assimilation of such immersive technologies necessarily brings with it many challenges, advantages, and risks, which have led to differing opinions among educators, students, and academics. This paper provides a preliminary reflection on the risks and benefits that higher education students perceive in the formal use of this type of tool for academic purposes. An exit survey was used to verify the initial opinions of the students, obtaining almost 90 percent of positive perceptions, but only considering AI as a support tool. In contrast, a significant percentage mentioned that there could be some risks in using this technology: dependency on AI tools, loss of creativity and plagiarism according to institutional policies. Despite its innovative and significant importance, the students acknowledge that the tool is imperfect and accept several disadvantages, such as incorrect answers, poor quality references and the production of unsafe content, so its use must regulate and for now remain only as a complementary support tool.},

  year={2024},
  volume={17},
  number={},
  pages={1562-1573},
  abstract={The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has ignited an increase in discussions about generative AI tools in education. In this study, a human-centered learning and teaching framework that uses generative AI tools for self-regulated learning development through domain knowledge learning was proposed to catalyze changes in educational practices. The framework illustrates how generative AI tools can revolutionize educational practices and transform the processes of teaching and learning to become human-centered. It emphasizes the evolving roles of teachers, who increasingly become skillful facilitators and humanistic storytellers who craft differentiated instructions and attempt to develop students’ individualized learning. Drawing upon insights from neuroscience, the framework guides students to employ generative AI tools to augment their attentiveness, stimulate active engagement in learning, receive immediate feedback, and encourage self-reflection. The pedagogical approach is also reimagined; teachers equipped with generative AI tools and AI literacy can refine their teaching strategies to better equip students to meet future challenges. The practical application of the framework is demonstrated in a case study involving the development of Chinese language writing ability among primary students within a K–12 educational context. This article also reports the results of a 60-h development programme for teachers. Specifically, providing in-service teachers with cases involving uses of the proposed framework helped them to better understand the generative AI concepts and integrate them into their teaching and learning and increased their perceived ability to design AI-integrated courses that would enhance students’ attention, engagement, confidence, and satisfaction.},

  year={2024},
  volume={67},
  number={5},
  pages={777-785},
  abstract={Contributions: An adoption framework to include generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in the university curriculum. It identifies and highlights the role of different stakeholders (university management, students, staff, etc.) during the adoption process. It also proposes an objective approach based upon an evaluation matrix to assess the success and outcome of the GenAI adoption. Background: Universities worldwide are debating and struggling with the adoption of GenAI in their curriculum. GenAI has impacted our perspective on traditional methods of academic integrity and the scholarship of teaching, learning, and research. Both the faculty and students are unsure about the approach in the absence of clear guidelines through the administration and regulators. This requires an established framework to define a process and articulate the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder involved. Research Questions: Whether the academic ecosystem requires a methodology to adopt GenAI into its curriculum? A systematic approach for the academic staff to ensure the students’ learning outcomes are met with the adoption of GenAI. How to measure and communicate the adoption of GenAI in the university setup? Methodology: The methodology employed in this study focuses on examining the university education system and assessing the opportunities and challenges related to incorporating GenAI in teaching and learning. Additionally, it identifies a gap and the absence of a comprehensive framework that obstructs the effective integration of GenAI within the academic environment. Findings: The literature survey results indicate the limited or no adoption of GenAI by the university, which further reflects the dilemma in the minds of different stakeholders. For the successful adoption of GenAI, a standard framework is proposed 1) for effective redesign of the course curriculum; 2) for enabling staff and students; and 3) to define an evaluation matrix to measure the effectiveness and success of the adoption process.},

  number={},
  pages={165797-165809},
  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technology innovation holds promise for revolutionizing the mining industry. However, the sector’s traditionally conservative stance toward innovation has led to limited research. Thus, this manuscript aims to address this gap by exploring factors influencing the acceptance of GenAI technology innovation among mining industry employees from a developing country perspective. Based on literature reviews seven factors were identified to influence employees’ acceptance of GenAI technological innovation. These factors were examined in a data sample of 286 mining industry employees collected via an office-intercept survey and analyzed with Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) using the SmartPLS software. Through thorough data analysis, models have been constructed that exhibit robustness, evidenced by their strong validity, reliability, and excellent fit with the data. The findings reveal that attitude, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, compatibility, company size, industrial competitiveness, and top management support significantly influence the acceptance of GenAI technology innovation. Notably, attitude was identified as the most influential factor, significantly shaping the likelihood of adoption. Conversely, company size had a comparatively minor impact on acceptance, and the regulatory framework showed no significant effect on the adoption of GenAI technology innovation. These results have important theoretical and managerial implications. Theoretically, they provide a nuanced understanding of the key factors driving technology acceptance in the mining industry, challenging the traditional emphasis on regulatory frameworks. Managerially, they underscore the importance of focusing on factors when developing strategies to foster technological adoption.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is emerging as a transformative technology in higher education, particularly in programming instruction. However, its impact on learning, motivation, and the educational environment must still be fully understood. This study aims to determine the capacity of GenAI to generate effective computer programming learning in STEM university students, comparing it with active learning methods based on video. An experiment was conducted with 40 computer engineering students divided into two groups: one using GenAI (Google Gemini 1.5) and another employing educational videos. Pre- and post-tests of knowledge and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) were applied to evaluate learning, intrinsic motivation, and the learning environment. No significant differences in learning were found between the groups. However, GenAI significantly increased perceived autonomy and reduced perceived effort and pressure, while video-based learning significantly improved perceived competence. These findings suggest that both methods seem to motivate in diverse ways and that they could complement each other in an integrated teaching approach, offering new perspectives for designing programming learning environments in higher education.},

  abstract={The rapid evolution of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has revolutionized various industries through its creational affordances. However, the impact of these affordances on business outcomes remains underexplored. Drawing on the resource-based view, we examine the relationships among GenAI's creational affordances, customer orientation, customization, and market performance. Using survey data from 196 information technology (IT) firms in mainland China, we reveal that both product and service customization significantly mediate the positive relationship between GenAI's creational affordances and market performance. Furthermore, customer orientation merely enhances the mediation effect of service customization, underscoring its critical role in maximizing the strategic benefits of GenAI. We contribute to existing technology-driven operations management research by emphasizing the moderated mediation mechanism in the relationship between GenAI's creational affordances and market performance. Our findings not only assist IT firms in better implementing their AI strategies but also offer a reference for the development of other firms.},

The study employed a case study on fourth-grade students in a primary school in China. Semi-structured interviews with 21 students and two teachers were conducted face-to-face. Then, the interview data were analyzed by thematic analysis based on the three-dimensions theoretical framework of Mathematical Motivation Scale: Beliefs, Engagement, and Attitude. This study found that the use of AI-generated formative feedback enhanced student mathematical motivation by (1) boosting confidence, promoting socio-emotional interaction, and raising the importance of mathematics; (2) rewarding and inspiring a preference for mathematics; and (3) stimulating interest and mental-physical effort. These results provide insights for educators to design how to make use of AI-generated formative feedback to promote mathematical learning. It nonetheless calls for more research using quantitative methods and from different perspectives on this topic.},

  abstract={This research aimed to create and evaluate a hedonic motivation model to comprehend elderly citizens’ acceptance of generative artificial intelligence. The age-related cognitive ability traits and perceived boredom of the elderly were added to the earlier technology acceptance model in the proposed hedonic motivation and flow model. The theoretical model was empirically evaluated using survey questionnaire data of 314 respondents over 55 years. The result showed that cognitive ability significantly impacted perceived ease-of-use, impacting all five hedonic variables. Flow experience was impacted by curiosity and joy but not by control. It was also found that perceived usefulness did not impact usage, while boredom and flow experience impacted usage of GAI-assisted personalized elderly care. The study stated implications for theory and practice before concluding with future research directions.},

  title={Authentic Assessment Design for Meeting the Challenges of Generative Artificial Intelligence}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Authentic Assessments are generally seen as alternate to traditional assessments though the scope of an authentic assessment is much larger than that of a traditional assessment. Authentic assessments help students in comprehending the subject matter and, if properly designed, can also ensure student workplace readiness. During the authentic assessment design, five most important aspects are considered and their incorporation is sought. These aspects include; the assessment objectives, the physical context of an assessment, the social context, the outcome of the assessment and the assessment criteria. Emergence of the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) supported applications and the Large Language Model (LLM) tools has posed new challenges to the authentic assessment design. Student access to these new applications and tools has also changed the socio-technological realities of the Learning and Teaching (L&T) practices. Therefore, we need to reimagine both, the L&T practices and the design and execution of authentic assessments. Keeping the prevailing socio-technological context in perspective, this work in progress paper proposes extending the scope of authentic assessments. The aim is to use them for quelling the growing problem of plagiarism as plagiarism can be facilitated by the use of GAI and LLM tools. Instead of considering authentic assessments as merely ‘an alternate to the traditional examination’ or ‘a tool for evaluating student workplace readiness,’ we propose adding ‘GAI redundancy’ to the scope of authentic assessments. For incorporating GAI redundancy we propose using either the game-based learning environment or a simulation environment. These two environments can be used for generating ‘close to real life’ problem-solving scenarios while assessing student comprehension and workplace readiness. In order to help practitioners, this paper also presents two examples of authentic assessments that were developed for combating plagiarism vis-à-vis enhancing student learning and evaluating their workplace readiness. In the first example, we show how to use a game environment and in the second example we demonstrate use of a simulation environment. The two examples also show how course contents can be embedded and how GAI redundancy can be incorporated in authentic assessments. The reported teaching assessment data and student feedback suggest that the proposed authentic assessment design and implementation strategies were able to engage students, help their comprehension and evaluate their workforce readiness.},

  abstract={Personality recognition from textual data plays a crucial role in various applications such as social media analysis, recommendation systems, and personalized marketing. In this study, we propose an effective personality recognition model leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence based Learning Principles (GAILP), which combines DenseNet feature extraction from user profile images with text-based features extracted using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model is implemented in Python, utilizing popular libraries such as TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and NLTK. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model on a Myers-Briggs Personality Type Dataset obtained from Kaggle, containing self-reported MBTI types and associated textual data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the GAILP model, achieving an accuracy of over 97% in personality recognition tasks. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating visual and textual cues for accurate personality recognition and underscore the potential of GAILP-based approaches in this domain.},

  abstract={This article addresses the comprehensive evaluation of web accessibility in 20 generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications, such as ChatGPT and DALL-E, through a five-phase approach. Common issues were identified, including inadequate image descriptions, lack of semantic structures, and keyboard navigation challenges. Despite the inherent complexity of generative tools, the importance of evaluating their accessibility to ensure the inclusion of users with diverse abilities is emphasized. The WAVE automatic tool was used to identify issues, and future directions are proposed, such as improving image descriptions and optimizing keyboard navigation. The most significant accessibility challenges are linked to minimal contrast, representing 38%, followed by issues in easy-to-read font and text alternatives, both at 15%, associated with the perceptible principle. The discussion covers areas for improvement, ethical implications, and strategies to foster continuous enhancement in generative AI accessibility, highlighting the importance of balancing benefits and ethical challenges. Future research includes developing techniques for automatically generating consistent image descriptions, refining semantic structures, and optimizing keyboard navigation. Additionally, it is imperative to improve automatic accessibility evaluation tools to address the unique challenges of generative AI applications.},

  pages={6607-6620},
  abstract={Mobile-edge generation (MEG) is an emerging technology that allows the network to meet the challenging traffic load expectations posed by the rise of generative artificial intelligence (GAI). A novel MEG model is proposed for deploying GAI models on edge servers (ESs) and user equipment (UE) to jointly complete text-to-image generation tasks. In the generation task, the ES and UE will cooperatively generate the image according to the text prompt given by the user. To enable the MEG, a pretrained latent diffusion model (LDM) is invoked to generate the latent feature, and an edge-inferencing MEG protocol is employed for data transmission exchange between the ES and the UE. A compression coding technique is proposed for compressing the latent features to produce seeds. Based on the above seed-enabled MEG model, an image quality optimization problem with energy constraint is formulated. The transmitting power of the seed is dynamically optimized by a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent over the fading channel. The proposed MEG-enabled text-to-image generation system is evaluated in terms of image quality and transmission overhead. The numerical results indicate that, compared to the conventional centralized generation-and-downloading scheme, the symbol number of the transmission of MEG is materially reduced. In addition, the proposed compression coding approach can improve the quality of generated images under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, and the DRL-enabled dynamic power control further improves the image quality under the energy constraint compared to static transmit power control.},

  year={2025},
  volume={18},

  pages={6422-6439},
  abstract={Airborne platforms and satellites provide rich sensor data in the form of hyperspectral images (HSI), which are crucial for numerous vision-related tasks, such as feature extraction, image enhancement, and data synthesis. This article reviews the contextual importance and applications of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in the advancement of HSI processing. GAI methods address the inherent challenges of HSI data, such as high dimensionality, noise, and the need to preserve spectral-spatial correlations, rendering them indispensable for modern HSI analysis. Generative neural networks, including generative adversarial networks and denoising diffusion probabilistic models, are highlighted for their superior performance in classification, segmentation, and object identification tasks, often surpassing traditional approaches, such as U-Nets, autoencoders, and deep convolutional neural networks. Diffusion models showed competitive performance in tasks, such as feature extraction and image resolution enhancement, particularly in terms of inference time and computational cost. Transformer architectures combined with attention mechanisms further improved the accuracy of generative methods, particularly for preserving spectral and spatial information in tasks, such as image translation, data augmentation, and data synthesis. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, particularly in developing computationally efficient models for super-resolution and data synthesis. In addition, novel evaluation metrics tailored to the complex nature of HSI data are needed. This review underscores the potential of GAI in addressing these challenges while presenting its current strengths, limitations, and future research directions.},
