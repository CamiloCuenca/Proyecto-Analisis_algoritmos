  pages={12116-12132},
  abstract={Remarkable strides have been made in super-resolution methods based on deep learning for hyperspectral images (HSIs), which are capable of enhancing the spatial resolution. However, these methods predominantly focus on capturing local features using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), neglecting the comprehensive utilization of global spatial-spectral information. To address this limitation, we innovatively propose a multiscale spatial-spectral CNN-transformer network for hyperspectral image super resolution, namely, MSHSR. MSHSR not only applies the local spatial-spectral characteristics but also innovatively facilitates the collaborative exploration and application of spatial details and spectral data globally. Specifically, we first design a multiscale spatial-spectral fusion module, which integrates dilated-convolution parallel branches and a hybrid spectral attention mechanism to address the strong local correlations in HSIs, effectively capturing and fusing multiscale local spatial-spectral information. Furthermore, in order to fully exploit the global contextual consistency in HSIs, we introduce a sparse spectral transformer module. This module processes the previously obtained local spatial-spectral features, thoroughly exploring the elaborate global interrelationship and long-range dependencies among different spectral bands through a coarse-to-fine strategy. Extensive experimental results on three hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, outperforming comparison methods both in quantitative metrics and visual performance.},

  title={Implicit Neural Attention for Removing Blur in Remote Sensing Images}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={22},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Deblurring in remote sensing images is a challenging task due to the long-range imaging capabilities of remote sensing sensors, which often results in image blur. Factors contributing to image blur include atmospheric disturbances during long-range imaging or the orbital motion of remote sensing platforms. The existing methods remove blur in remote sensing images using the traditional attention mechanism, which focuses on a limited number of features. However, they often overlook the features among neighboring positions in blurry areas, and these areas contain more relevant features. Leveraging these features can effectively assist in restoring the complex object textures of remote sensing blurry images. To achieve this, we propose a novel implicit neural attention mechanism for assembling more relevant features implied by surrounding coordinates. Specifically, we use the features and their corresponding coordinates to learn the enhanced feature representation with more relevant features, and this representation can be used to derive the deblurred images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method, INA-RSDeblur, outperforms the state-of-the-art deblurring methods in remote sensing blurry images.},

  abstract={Traditionally, ideating new product innovations is primarily the responsibility of marketers, engineers, and designers. However, a rapidly growing interest lies in leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) to brainstorm new product and service ideas. This study conducts a comparative analysis of ideas generated by human professionals and an AI system. The results of a blind expert evaluation show that AI-generated ideas score significantly higher in novelty and customer benefit, while their feasibility scores are similar to those of human ideas. Overall, AI-generated ideas comprise the majority of the top-performing ideas, while human-generated ideas scored lower than expected. The executive's emotional and cognitive reactions were measured during the evaluation to check for potential biases and showed no differences between the idea groups. These findings suggest that, under certain circumstances, companies can benefit from integrating generative AI into their traditional idea-generation processes.},

  year={2024},
  volume={12},
  number={},
  pages={95368-95389},
  abstract={The increasing integration of ChatGPT, a Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) model, into educational environments has sparked substantial ethical concerns. This paper addresses the crucial question of whether to impose restrictions or legislate the usage of Gen-AI, with ChatGPT as a pivotal case study. Through systematic literature review and frequency of occurrence analysis, 10 ethical concerns were selected for further analysis using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The analysis responses of 10 expert panels show that the top concerns, as revealed by their weights, after meeting the consistency requirement, include copyright, legal, and compliance issues (0.1731), privacy and confidentiality (0.1286), academic integrity (0.1206), incorrect reference and citation practices (0.1111), and safety and security concerns (0.1050). Evaluating the impact of these concerns on the policy alternatives (restriction and legislation), the findings revealed that “Restriction” received a higher weight (0.513712) compared to “Legislation” (0.485887). Notably, copyright, legal, and compliance issues, privacy and confidentiality, and academic integrity emerged as crucial factors influencing the decision between restriction and legislation. This study offers valuable insights for educational institutions and policymakers, suggesting the need for inclusive discussions, pilot programs to assess impacts on critical thinking, development of clear guidelines, flexible regulatory frameworks, awareness campaigns, and potential strategies for ethical and responsible use.},

  year={2024},
  volume={42},
  number={10},
  pages={2737-2753},
  abstract={Groundbreaking applications such as ChatGPT have heightened research interest in generative artificial intelligence (GAI). Essentially, GAI excels not only in content generation but also signal processing, offering support for wireless sensing. Hence, we introduce a novel GAI-assisted human flow detection system (G-HFD). Rigorously, G-HFD first uses the channel state information (CSI) to estimate the velocity and acceleration of propagation path length change of the human induced reflection (HIR). Then, given the strong inference ability of the diffusion model, we propose a unified weighted conditional diffusion model (UW-CDM) to denoise the estimation results, enabling detection of the number of targets. Next, we use the CSI obtained by a uniform linear array with wavelength spacing to estimate the HIR’s time of flight and direction of arrival (DoA). In this process, UW-CDM solves the problem of ambiguous DoA spectrum, ensuring accurate DoA estimation. Finally, through clustering, G-HFD determines the number of subflows and the number of targets in each subflow, i.e., the subflow size. The evaluation based on practical downlink communication signals shows G-HFD’s accuracy of subflow size detection can reach 91%. This validates its effectiveness and underscores the significant potential of GAI in the context of wireless sensing.},

  pages={87742-87766},
  abstract={Recommender Systems (RSs), which generate personalized content, have become a technological tool with diverse applications for users. While numerous RSs have been proposed and successfully implemented across various domains, traditional AI-based RSs still encounter certain challenges, such as data sparsity, cold start, and diversity. Generative Artificial Intelligence in recommender systems is a recent advancement used by platforms like Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon to recommend items, news, videos, audios, goods, and services to their customers/users or to personalize experiences for their customers/users. The main purpose of this review is to compare traditional AI-based recommender systems with generative AI-based recommender systems. A total of fifty-two (52) papers, published between 2019 and February 2024, were selected from six major online libraries. To get a more comprehensive understanding of the selected study, we reviewed the selected studies techniques, and the models, datasets, and metrics used. Our systematic review reveals that generative AI models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoder (VAEs) and autoencoders have been widely used in recommender systems and they perform better than traditional AI techniques. Among the 30 datasets analyzed, MovieLens was the most frequently used, accounting for 33%, while Amazon datasets accounted for 11%, Recall and RSME are the most commonly used metrics. Our literature review offers understandings into the Generative AI techniques used across different recommender systems and provides suggestions for the future research. Finally, we elaborated on open issues and discussed current and future trends in generative AI-based recommendation systems.},

  abstract={In today's era, technology has become pervasive worldwide, significantly facilitating access to learning resources. Notably, the emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has garnered rapid attention and interest in a short period with the introduction of ChatGPT. Many individuals have extensively discussed and evaluated this AI-powered language model, from researchers to casual internet users. Importantly, Generative AI applications are increasingly recognized for their potential in educational contexts. In the realm of education, AI has the potential to significantly broaden and improve teaching and learning in higher education. However, while numerous studies have explored the effectiveness of Generative AI applications in programming language learning, an absence of research examining their impact comprehensively exists. Hence, this study aims to identify the factors that affect the successful utilization of Generative AI applications in the context of undergraduate programming language learning, with a particular emphasis on the viewpoints of university students. A systematic literature review was undertaken to obtain the research objectives, adhering to the Prisma 2020 guidelines, which involved selecting and analyzing 47 prior studies.

This article examines the word cloud, a toolkit often used to scaffold teaching and learning for reflection, critical thinking, and content learning. Addressing the issues in traditional word clouds, semantic word clouds have been developed but they are technically challenging to develop and still problematic. However, generative AI has the potential to develop efficient, accurate, creative, and accessible word clouds. Three different methods representing three major approaches of word cloud generation were developed, implemented, and user evaluated—traditional (baseline), semantic (natural language processing enhanced), and generative AI (generative pretrained transformer based)—in two different language contexts—Chinese (China case) and English (Singapore case). The findings of the study show the technical robustness of the methods, as well as provide key pedagogical insights from the user perspective of instructors of higher education courses in China and Singapore. Implications to the design of word clouds and their application in teaching and learning are discussed.},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Students’ decision-making related to attending college for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees and retaining them within those fields continue to be of focus, especially when considering the national goal of satisfying industry, private, and public sector workforce needs. This is particularly important when considering growing national security concerns and ongoing high cybersecurity and climate change workforce demands. However, despite concerted efforts, low enrollment and student attrition continue to be a challenge, even more so since the onset of the global pandemic. Simultaneously, the utilization of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has seen a sharp increase since 2022 by various stakeholders, most notably college students. Additionally, faculty are encouraged by their higher education institutions to incorporate these tools within classrooms for several reasons, including demands from industry for students to gain knowledge and experience with generative AI tools. Given the importance of understanding the ongoing issue of STEM degree attrition and the increasing utilization of generative AI, this research study explored these two areas using ChatGPT, one of the world's most utilized generative AI language models, within the process. The first research question (RQ#l) is: What is the top reason why students do notfinish college? The response provided solely emphasized finances and/or financial constraints. Based on that answer, the second research question (RQ #2) was: Is getting a college degree worth the cost? RQ #2 was explored to allow a deeper understanding of the initial research question from a different angle. Both questions were analyzed through the lens of two theoretical frameworks, the human capital theory and the principal-agent theory, and results were compared to the literature as a form of research validation. This research study is essential as there is an ongoing increase in the utilization of generative AI in homes, K-12 institutions, and higher education for everyday knowledge, formal and informal education. When considering that soon-to-be and current college students may be using these generative AI tools to make decisions related to pursuing and/or retaining their educational status, it is essential to explore how generative AI system outputs align with what has been researched and documented in the literature. Therefore, this research study explored the application of ChatGPT and the system's responses to research questions as a form of document analysis and analyzed those results using triangulation as a form of validation. The analysis and results of this study contributed directly to the recommendations and feedback to the owners of ChatGPT - OpenAI. Additionally, the results highlighted a need for increased focus on AI ethics related to data input, data output, access to the system, and who has a seat at the table as the company recommends, approves, and implements changes. Limitations of this study are provided along with an overarching concluding statement.},

  abstract={The purpose of this study was to explore the efficacy of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in optimizing online degree courses to enhance student retention and performance. Within the context of online learning platforms, there is a challenge in efficiently and effectively updating course content, which can impact the quality and relevance of the experience. The aim of this pilot was to utilize GenAI to create and augment educational resources, thus improving the clarity, scaffolding, and engagement of the online degree coursework. The methods employed in this pilot study included a quasi-experimental design where a Performance-Based Admissions (PBA) degree course was selected, its content was optimized using GenAI, and the impact was measured using a Difference-in-Differences (DID) analysis comparing optimized and non-optimized courses. The results indicate a 6% increase in course pass rates and significant improvements in midterm pass rates, average final grades, and the percentage of assignments submitted on time within the optimized course. Given these results, we estimate a 3% to 13% positive impact on second term persistence if all first-term courses received a similar GenAI optimization. The impact of this study is significant, demonstrating the potential of GenAI to revolutionize educational practices by providing quickly-produced, high-quality, low-cost content that enhances student learning outcomes. It supports the shift towards student-centered learning approaches and can be particularly beneficial in resource-constrained environments. In conclusion, the study underscores the transformative role of GenAI in education and emphasizes the need for ethical and responsible use to empower students and improve learning outcomes.},

  pages={31576-31588},
  abstract={Humans possess the remarkable capacity to comprehend narratives presented in text and subsequently conjure associated mental images through their imagination. This cognitive ability enhances their grasp of the content and augments their overall enjoyment. Consequently, the development of an automated system aimed at producing visually faithful images based on textual descriptions, often referred to as the text-to-image task, stands as a profoundly meaningful endeavor. For this reason, a variety of text-to-image generating artificial intelligences (AIs) have been devised until now. Nevertheless, the generative AIs introduced thus far encounter an issue wherein they struggle to uphold the coherence of input sentences, particularly when multiple sentences are provided. Within this paper, we present a remedy to this challenge through the application of prompt editing. Furthermore, our experimental results substantiate that our proposed solution more effectively preserves contextual coherence among the generated images in comparison to other preexisting generative artificial intelligence models. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves performance by at least 30 percent in terms of the similarity of the generated image and by 130 percent in terms of  $ROUGE_{recall}$ .},

  abstract={Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication supports numerous tasks, from driving safety to entertainment services. To achieve a holistic view, vehicles are typically equipped with multiple sensors. However, processing large volumes of multimodal data increases transmission load, while the dynamic nature of vehicular networks adds to transmission instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, generative artificial intelligence (GAI)-enhanced multimodal semantic communication (SemCom), referred to as G-MSC, designed to handle various vehicular network tasks by employing suitable analog or digital transmission. GAI presents a promising opportunity to transform the SemCom framework by significantly enhancing semantic encoding, semantic information transmission, and semantic decoding. It optimizes multimodal information fusion at the transmitter, enhances channel robustness during transmission, and mitigates noise interference at the receiver. To validate the effectiveness of the G-MSC framework, we conduct a case study showcasing its performance in vehicular communication networks for predictive tasks. The experimental results show that the design achieves reliable and efficient communication in V2X networks. In the end, we present future research directions of G-MSC.},

  abstract={Traffic flow prediction holds great promise in prompting the rapid development of intelligent transportation systems. The key challenge for traffic flow prediction lies in effectively modeling the complicated spatiotemporal dependencies of traffic data while considering privacy and cost concerns. Existing methods based on neural networks exhibit limitations, particularly in handling dynamic data and long-distance dependencies. To address these challenges, we have proposed a novel distributed traffic flow prediction architecture that makes the integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and hierarchical federated learning. This architecture makes the prediction of traffic flow by incorporating spatial self-attention module and traffic delay-aware feature transformation module, which achieves a better balance between communication and computation costs, enhances training efficiency and guarantees data privacy and security. Next, we have introduced the important characteristics and key technologies used for this devised architecture.

  abstract={The evolution of consumer electronics is increasingly driven by advancements in industrial automation, where generative artificial intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role, particularly in intent-based systems. This study presents a comprehensive framework for integrating generative AI into intent-based industrial automation, which aims to align high-level business goals with precise operational tasks on the factory floor. The proposed architecture synergistically combines three main components: Business Intents, the Intent Layer, and the Factory Floor Shop. This framework leverages foundation models such as the most prominent large language models (LLMs) and advanced communication technologies to translate strategic business intents—such as cost optimization, order management, and market adaptation into actionable tasks to improve operational efficiency, responsiveness, and strategic alignment. We also propose a process of fine-tuning LLMs to optimize their interaction flow within the intent-based system, highlighting the augmentation techniques employed to adapt LLMs for industrial contexts. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and show percentage improvements compared to pretrained LLM models.},

  abstract={This study employs a design science research approach to propose a foundational information system design theory tailored for generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) applications in the fashion design process. It delineates meta-requirements and design principles that address both the transformative potential of GenAI, and the unique challenges faced by the fashion sector. To validate the practicality of the proposed design theory, a prototype system was developed and evaluated with feedback from 30 experienced fashion practitioners, confirming its feasibility and effectiveness. Insights from case studies conducted with two Hong Kong-based fashion companies further highlight the benefits and challenges of integrating GenAI into fashion design. While GenAI demonstrates promise in enhancing communication, accelerating design processes, and improving customer engagement and satisfaction, key challenges remain, including the need for high-quality datasets, significant computational resources, and ethical considerations related to AI-generated designs. The design principles derived from this study provide a structured guideline for system designers, offering a practical framework for developing GenAI systems that cater to the specific needs of the fashion industry. By contributing both theoretical and practical insights, this study advances understanding of how GenAI can drive innovation in fashion design and lays a foundation for future research in this domain.},

  title={Designing Generative Artificial Intelligence Integrated Immersive Virtual Reality Therapeutic Experiences to Support Meaning-centered Grief Therapies for Bereaved Parents},

  pages={299-303},
  abstract={Bereaved parents often struggle to make sense of and find meaning in and after their loss due to the untimely nature of their child’s death. Challenges with finding meaning have been associated with prolonged grief symptoms that can adversely affect grieving parents’ quality of life. Recently, meaning-centered grief interventions that focus on facilitating adaptive meaning-making after loss have shown therapeutic benefits in reducing prolonged grief symptoms in bereaved individuals. However, these interventions are mostly administered in one-on-one, in-person settings, which limits their accessibility to a broader population due to logistical and locational constraints. While existing videoconferencing applications can provide remote bereavement support and deliver grief therapies, they often lack engaging user experiences and features to support high interactivity, guided imagery and mindfulness exercises commonly used in meaning-centered grief therapies. We hypothesize that the immersive and interactive nature of a networked immersive virtual reality (IVR) system, enhanced with custom content creation features from text-to-image generative artificial intelligence (genAI) models, will create a unique and individualized therapeutic experience that supports meaning-centered grief techniques and activities for bereaved parents in a shared virtual world. This work-in-progress paper presents the design concept of the system prototype, preliminary survey results on user acceptance of the technology, and selected user experience scenarios.},

  abstract={In the rapidly evolving landscape of aerial–terrestrial–marine integrated transportation, vehicular communication systems are confronted with various challenges, including unpredictable signal fading, the scarcity of spectrum resources, and the complexity of network topologies. This article introduces a novel generative artificial intelligence (GAI)-driven model designed to enhance the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) across these domains. The proposed system enhances situational awareness by seamlessly integrating multisource data, offering a real-time and unified environmental view supporting precise predictive analytics. Additionally, the model employs generative diffusion models (GDMs) in cognitive radio (CR), optimizing spectrum utilization through dynamic sensing and adaptive allocation strategies. Furthermore, the system redefines network performance by enabling real-time configuration adjustments and optimizing communication paths to adapt to ever-changing conditions. Our findings demonstrate that GAI has the potential to significantly improve the scalability, efficiency, and suitability of IoV systems, paving the way for smarter and more resilient vehicular communications in complex multidomain environments.},
