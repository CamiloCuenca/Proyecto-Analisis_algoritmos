  abstract={Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the world [1]. Mortality rates stand at 27 percent in India and 60 in Africa, compared to 7 in the US [2]. This disconnect boils down to the time of diagnosis. According to the CDC late-stage diagnosis has a five-year mortality rate of 69 percent, compared to 2 percent for early diagnosis [3]. Underserved communities lack access to high-cost, advanced diagnostic tech-nologies (MRIs/Mammograms) and cancer specialists (Oncolo-gists/Radiologists) [4]. Patients must depend on low-cost, low-resolution modalities (Ultrasounds) and the limited breast cancer expertise of general physicians (and gynecologists in developing countries), significantly delaying diagnosis and subsequent in-tervention [5]. This study aims to reduce global breast cancer mortality and healthcare costs by enabling accurate, early, and low-cost diagnosis using the existing ultrasound infrastructure in developing countries and underserved communities. To address data scarcity and skew, advanced image augmentation techniques such as deep convolutional GANs and stable diffusion models were evaluated. In each case of data augmentation, two classification approaches were compared: a lightweight MobileNetV2 convolutional neural network and a hybrid model combining ResNet50 for feature extraction with statistical machine learning models. The highest detection accuracy (95 percent) was achieved using the hybrid model with ResNet50 and XGBoost, paired with Stable Diffusion augmentation. An iOS app was implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in resource-constrained settings, showcasing its potential for scalable, efficient diagnostic solutions.},

  abstract={With the development of 5G technology and Internet of Things, all kinds of real life data are collected and recorded by a large number of sensors. It is of great significance to mine and analyze the hidden information in the data for applications like future prediction. However, due to interferences or instability of collection equipment, collected sensory data are often incomplete, and this incompleteness hinders the in-depth analysis of data in the cloud. Therefore, processing around missing values is significant. Relying on cloud machine learning methods is not enough to deal with the problem of missing data in the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) environment, however, edge computing provides a promising solution. In this article, gated recurrent units filling is employed at the edge nodes. A mobile edge node can not only find the historical information of the current missing data node but also acquire the data of the nodes adjacent to the missing data node. These ensure that the missing data are restored to the maximum extent at the source. The experimental results show that the missing value filling based on edge computing not only outperforms other filling methods in quality but also greatly reduces the energy consumption in AIoT.},

  volume={8},
  number={},
  pages={165044-165055},
  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made great progress in synthesizing realistic images in recent years. However, they are often trained on image datasets with either too few samples or too many classes belonging to different data distributions. Consequently, GANs are prone to underfitting or overfitting, making the analysis of them difficult and constrained. Therefore, in order to conduct a thorough study on GANs while obviating unnecessary interferences introduced by the datasets, we train them on artificial datasets where there are infinitely many samples and the real data distributions are simple, high-dimensional and have structured manifolds. Moreover, the generators are designed such that optimal sets of parameters exist. Empirically, we find that under various distance measures, the generator fails to learn such parameters with the GAN training procedure. In addition, we confirm that using mixtures of GANs is more beneficial than increasing the network depth or width when the model complexity is high enough. The benefit is partially due to the division of the generation and discrimination tasks across multiple generators and discriminators. We find that a mixture of generators can discover different modes or different classes automatically in the unsupervised setting. As an example of the generalizability of our conclusions to realistic datasets, we train a mixture of GANs on the CIFAR-10 dataset and our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of popular metrics, i.e., Inception Score (IS) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID).},

  abstract={Next-generation (xG) wireless networks, with their complex and dynamic nature, present significant challenges to using traditional optimization techniques. Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) emerges as a powerful tool due to its unique strengths. Unlike traditional optimization techniques and other machine learning methods, GAI excels at learning from real-world network data, capturing its intricacies. This enables safe, offline exploration of various configurations and generation of diverse, unseen scenarios, empowering proactive, data-driven exploration and optimization for xG networks. Additionally, GAI’s scalability makes it ideal for large-scale xG networks. This paper surveys how GAI-based models unlock optimization opportunities in xG wireless networks. We begin by providing a review of GAI models and some of the major communication paradigms of xG (e.g., Sixth Generation) wireless networks. We then delve into exploring how GAI can be used to improve resource allocation and enhance overall network performance. Additionally, we briefly review the networking requirements for supporting GAI applications in xG wireless networks. The paper further discusses the key challenges and future research directions in leveraging GAI for network optimization. Finally, a case study demonstrates the application of a diffusion-based GAI model for load balancing, carrier aggregation, and backhauling optimization in non-terrestrial networks, a core technology of xG networks. This case study serves as a practical example of how the combination of reinforcement learning and GAI can be implemented to address real-world network optimization problems.},

A total of 123 studies were meticulously selected and analyzed, leading to the identification of key metrics, tools, standards, and research themes that are currently shaping the landscape of AI security research. This effort not only aids in distilling the collective wisdom of the research community but also sets a firm foundation for future work in this critical area. The findings from this SMS will serve as an invaluable guide for researchers and practitioners alike, enabling them to navigate the complexities of AI security and fostering the development of innovative, robust security solutions. This study also highlights significant gaps in the current literature, thereby outlining potential directions for new research initiatives.},

  abstract={Developing realistic and interactive virtual environments is a major hurdle in the progress of Metaverse. At present, majority of Metaverse applications necessitate the manual construction of 3D models which is both time-consuming and costly. Additionally, it is challenging to design environments that can promptly react to users’ actions. To address this challenge, this PhD Forum paper proposes a novel approach to generate virtual worlds using digital twin (DT) technology and AI through a Text-to-Metaverse pipeline. This pipeline converts natural language input into a scene JSON, which is used to generate a 3D virtual world using two engines: Generative Script Engine (GSE) and Generative Metaverse Engine (GME). GME generates a design script from the JSON file, and then uses it to generate 3D objects in an environment. It aims to use multimodal AI and DT technology to produce realistic and highly detailed virtual environments. The proposed pipeline has potential applications including education, training, architecture, healthcare and entertainment, and could change the way designers and developers create virtual worlds. While this paper covers an initial work as per the PhD Forum’s guidelines, it contributes to the research on generative models for multimodal data and provides a new direction for creating immersive virtual experiences.},

  abstract={Summary <p>Prompts, in the simplest terms, are the initial stimuli or cues provided to a system to elicit a particular response. Generative AI has ushered in an era of unparalleled innovation, but its true strength lies not just in its technical prowess but in democratizing access. This chapter shows how the role of prompts in generative AI contributes to this democratization. One of the primary factors guiding AI's response to a prompt is its training data. AI systems, especially language models, navigate vast amounts of information. A well&#x2010;crafted prompt serves as a compass, guiding the AI to traverse its knowledge base in a specific direction, ensuring that the output aligns closely with the user's intention. Ambiguous prompts can lead the AI to produce generalized or irrelevant responses. Carefully engineered prompts lead to more relevant and tailored responses, enhancing the user experience.</p>},

  abstract={The increasing demand for radio authorized applications in the 6G era necessitates enhanced monitoring and management of radio resources, particularly for precise control over the electromagnetic environment. The radio map serves as a crucial tool for describing signal strength distribution within the current electromagnetic environment. However, most existing algorithms rely on sparse measurements of radio strength, disregarding the impact of building information. In this paper, we propose a spectrum cartography (SC) algorithm that eliminates the need for relying on sparse ground-based radio strength measurements by utilizing a satellite network to collect data on buildings and transmitters. Our algorithm leverages Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to construct accurate radio maps using transmitter information within real geographical environments. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits superior accuracy compared to previously proposed methods.},

  abstract={With the continuous progress of artificial intelligence technology, multimodal generation model has gradually become one of the core technologies in various applications. However, how to ensure the security and consistency of generated content, especially in cross-modal generation tasks, is still a difficult problem to be solved. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal content secure alignment approach for multimodal generation, which combines generative adversarial network (GAN) and multimodal embedding technology to ensure the secure alignment and consistency of generated content across all modes. By embedding modal data such as image, text and speech, and using discriminator in generative adversarial network to conduct security review of generated content, our proposed cross-modal content security alignment method can effectively reduce the content that does not meet the security standards. The experimental results show that in the cross-modal generation task based on COCO and Flickr30K dataset, the accuracy of the proposed method can reach 92.6%, while the generation rate of unsafe content is significantly lower than the existing method, and the reduction rate is up to 35%. In addition, the similarity score (CIDEr) of the proposed method in the task of image description generation and text generation is increased by 15.3% compared with the traditional method, showing relatively excellent generation quality. This research not only provides an effective cross-modal content security alignment method, but also provides a new idea and solution for the security of multi-modal generation systems, which has a wide application prospect and research value.},

  abstract={Recent advances in deep neural networks, especially in generative adversarial networks (GAN), have shown remarkable progress in face image generations. However, most of the existing face image generators can only synthesize random face images, but are not able to control the attributes of the generated face images. Though conditional GAN based methods can manipulate the attributes to some extent, but can only generate low-resolution face images up to 256 × 256. In this study, based on StyleGAN, one of the state-of-the-art image generators for synthesizing high-quality face images, we propose a simple but efficient approach to generate high-resolution and hyper-realistic face images with any desired attribute. By training an attribute classifier to assign attribute labels to given synthesized face images, we build the links between latent vectors and face attributes. In such a way, the latent vectors can be grouped into different clusters, one cluster corresponding to one face attribute, respectively. We then extract the prototypes for the clusters, which are used to control the attribute of the generated face image. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for high-quality face image generation with predefined attributes.},

  abstract={Summary <p>The seeds of modern artificial intelligence (AI) were first planted by ancient storytellers and philosophers from Greece, China, and Bharat. Ancient philosophers, including Aristotle, sought to structure and systematize reasoning. Ancient texts, much like modern science fiction, are replete with artificial beings that have unnatural intelligence that has been bestowed upon them by humans or the gods. During the 17th century, philosophers, including Hobbes, Descartes, and Leibniz, continued the search for a way to reduce rational thought into mathematical algorithms. In 1950, as neural networks were in their infancy, Alan Turing pondered the question &#x201c;Can machines think?&#x201d; In an attempt to answer this question, he developed his famous and influential Turing test, which gauged a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior that is indistinguishable from humans. Generative AI, in one form or another, is being baked into almost every tool we use, and applied in most professional disciplines across government, nonprofit, and private sectors.</p>},

  abstract={Anomaly detection is a classical problem where the aim is to detect anomalous data that do not belong to the normal data distribution. Current state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection on complex high-dimensional data are based on the generative adversarial network (GAN). However, the traditional GAN loss is not directly aligned with the anomaly detection objective: it encourages the distribution of the generated samples to overlap with the real data and so the resulting discriminator is ineffective as an anomaly detector. In this paper, we propose modifications to the GAN loss such that the generated samples lie at the boundaries of the real data distribution. With our modified GAN loss, our anomaly detection method, called Fence GAN (FGAN), directly uses the discriminator score as an anomaly threshold. Our experimental results on the MNIST, CIFAR10 and KDD99 datasets show that FGAN yields the best anomaly classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  year={2024},

  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Even with the increasing availability of high-quality public datasets, the shortage of training samples remains a primary hurdle in deep learning skin analysis. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) present a promising solution by generating synthetic skin lesion images that closely resemble real images. Numerous studies have investigated the potential of GANs in medical contexts, yet their applicability remains uncertain due to prevalent biases in biomedical datasets and associated risks. Initial experiments on skin lesion datasets have yielded unreliable outcomes, prompting the fundamental question: "Is GAN truly beneficial for biomedical classification tasks?" Additionally, concerns about the amplification of dataset biases by AI models warrant further investigation into the inherent biases inherited by GANs. Considering these gaps, this study conducts experiments on skin lesion classification using four GAN architectures to assess their effectiveness in data generation, both conditional and unconditional. Among these models, StyleGAN2, when unconditionally applied, produced samples that contributed to classification improvement. Moreover, the visual analysis of generated samples revealed that GANs tend to amplify the existing biases with high distribution while suppressing those with low distribution. These findings highlight the limited efficacy of GAN-based augmentation for skin lesion classification in specific scenarios. Thus, caution is advised against the widespread adoption of GANs in medical applications due to computational costs and associated risks.},

  abstract={Recently, there has been growing interest in au-tonomous shipping due to its potential to improve maritime efficiency and safety. The use of advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, can address the current navigational and operational challenges in autonomous shipping. In particular, inland waterway transport (IWT) presents a unique set of challenges, such as crowded waterways and variable environ-mental conditions. In such dynamic settings, the reliability and robustness of autonomous shipping solutions are critical factors for ensuring safe operations. This paper examines the robustness of benchmark deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, implemented for IWT within an autonomous shipping simulator, and their ability to generate effective motion planning policies. We demonstrate that a model-free approach can achieve an adequate policy in the simulator, successfully navigating port environments never encountered during training. We focus par-ticularly on Soft-Actor Critic (SAC), which we show to be inherently more robust to environmental disturbances compared to MuZero, a state-of-the-art model-based RL algorithm. In this paper, we take a significant step towards developing robust, applied RL frameworks that can be generalized to various vessel types and navigate complex port- and inland environments and scenarios.},

  abstract={This study aims to compare the psychometric properties of mathematics problem-solving assessment tools generated by Generative AI (Chat GPT) and those developed by humans. The participants included 130 students from 4 schools, selected through stratified sampling based on school size, out of 84 schools under the secondary educational service area office Khon Kaen. The mathematical problem-solving assessments (AI-generated and human-developed) were administered via Google Forms. The study employed Construct Modeling and Unidimensional Rasch Analysis to evaluate validity evidence, reliability evidence, quality of item fit, and the Turing test. The findings indicate that both tools are similar in content validity, but the AI-generated assessment demonstrates slightly higher accuracy in several aspects. Nevertheless, the human-developed assessment offers a better balance between the test difficulty and the examinees' ability. Human content evaluation remains crucial to ensure the material adheres to appropriate assessment standards.},

  title={Harnessing GAN with Metric Learning for One-Shot Generation on a Fine-Grained Category}, 
  year={2019},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={915-922},
  abstract={We propose a GAN-based one-shot generation method on a fine-grained category, which represents a subclass of a category, typically with diverse examples. One-shot generation refers to a task of taking an image which belongs to a class not used in the training phase and then generating a set of new images belonging to the same class. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which represents a type of deep neural networks with competing generator and discriminator, has proven to be useful in generating realistic images. Especially DAGAN, which maps the input image to a low-dimensional space via an encoder and then back to the example space via a decoder, has been quite effective with datasets such as handwritten character datasets. However, when the class corresponds to a fine-grained category, DAGAN occasionally generates images which are regarded as belonging to other classes due to the rich variety of the examples in the class and the low dissimilarities of the examples among the classes. For example, it accidentally generates facial images of different persons when the class corresponds to a specific person. To circumvent this problem, we introduce a metric learning with a triplet loss to the bottleneck layer of DAGAN to penalize such a generation. We also extend the optimization algorithm of DAGAN to an alternating procedure for two types of loss functions. Our proposed method outperforms DAGAN in the GAN-test task for VGG-Face dataset and CompCars dataset by 5.6% and 4.8% in accuracy, respectively. We also conducted experiments for the data augmentation task and observed 4.5% higher accuracy for our proposed method over DAGAN for VGG-Face dataset.},

  abstract={There have been multiple attempts in academia and industry to generate synthetic data. The requirements for synthetic data have surged with the evolution of AI/ML in the industry. Organizations frequently face roadblocks due to the non-availability of data relating to compliance, etc. This leads to a significant loss of opportunities as insights are not available due to data limitations. Traditionally, manual mocking, masking of production data, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) driven approaches, etc., have been explored, but they fail to address referential integrity. We present a Synthetic Data Generation framework to generate a relational data set comprising interlinked tables while maintaining referential integrity. The framework is an ensemble of many algorithms, including GAN, HMA (Hierarchical Modeling Algorithm), Explicit distribution extraction, etc. Further, we present an evaluation framework to measure the Veracity, Variety, and Volume of the generated data. The results have been validated on a variety of datasets across industries. We believe the framework can disrupt and help multiple organizations that are not able to leverage data due to any constraints.},

  abstract={With the advent of 5G commercialization, the need for more reliable, faster, and intelligent telecommunication systems is envisaged for the next generation beyond 5G (B5G) radio access technologies. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are immensely popular in service layer applications and have been proposed as essential enablers in many aspects of 5G and beyond networks, from IoT devices and edge computing to cloud-based infrastructures. However, existing 5G ML-based security surveys tend to emphasize AI/ML model performance and accuracy more than the models’ accountability and trustworthiness. In contrast, this paper explores the potential of Explainable AI (XAI) methods, which would allow stakeholders in 5G and beyond to inspect intelligent black-box systems used to secure next-generation networks. The goal of using XAI in the security domain of 5G and beyond is to allow the decision-making processes of ML-based security systems to be transparent and comprehensible to 5G and beyond stakeholders, making the systems accountable for automated actions. In every facet of the forthcoming B5G era, including B5G technologies such as ORAN, zero-touch network management, and end-to-end slicing, this survey emphasizes the role of XAI in them that the general users would ultimately enjoy. Furthermore, we presented the lessons from recent efforts and future research directions on top of the currently conducted projects involving XAI.},

  abstract={Pedestrian detection based on deep learning methods makes a big hit during these days. The key to achieve excellent results for deep learning-based pedestrian detection methods is a high-quality dataset. There are lots of outstanding datasets for pedestrian detection like EuroCity Persons, CityPersons, Caltech, etc. However, their efforts are not dedicated to the traffic scenarios with pedestrians in various poses. When the state-of-the-art detectors trained on datasets described above encounter the scene with pedestrians in variously complicated poses, the results are mostly worse than expected. In order to alleviate this problem, we propose a framework called SynPoses to create synthetic human with complicated poses in high quality. Experimental results show that, when facing scenarios with human in diverse poses, the performance of detectors trained on augmented dataset outperforms those trained on original dataset.},

Generative AI creates or alters various content types including text, image, audio, and video that are realistic and challenging to identify as AI-generated constructs. However, guardrails preventing malicious use of AI are easily bypassed. Numerous indications suggest that scammers are already using AI to enhance already successful scams, improving scam effectiveness, speed and credibility, while reducing detectability of scams that target older adults, who are known to be slow to adopt new technologies. Through hypothetical cases analysis of two leading scams, the tech support scams and the romance scams, this paper explores the future of AI in scams affecting older adults by identifying current vulnerabilities and recommending updated defensive measures focusing the establishment of a reliable support network offering elevated support to increase confidence and ability to defend against AI-enhanced scams.},

  abstract={Chile’s mining industry, a global leader in copper production, faces challenges due to increasing volumes of mining waste, particularly Waste Rock Dumps (WRD) and Leaching Waste Dumps (LWD). The National Service of Geology and Mining (SERNAGEOMIN) requires assessment of the physical stability (PS) of these facilities, but current methods are hindered by data scarcity and resource constraints. This study proposes a simplified evaluation methodology using first-order parameters from open-access data. By integrating Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)—utilizing models like YOLOv11 and convolutional neural networks—we automate the detection and characterization of WRD and LWD from satellite imagery, extracting critical parameters for PS assessment. This approach reduces analysis time and minimizes human error. Validated in the Antofagasta Region, Chile’s primary mining area, we identified and evaluated 70 WRD and 54 LWD. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of prioritizing deposits based on potential risk, enhancing SERNAGEOMIN’s capacity for supervision. The successful application suggests scalability to other mining regions and adaptability to different facility types, including tailings storage facilities. This work offers a practical tool to improve safety and risk management in the mining industry, addressing critical challenges in PS evaluation under current regulatory constraints.},

  abstract={This study examines the influence of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) technology on the workflows and career trajectories of designers. Using the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework, a mixed-methods approach was employed, integrating expert interviews and quantitative surveys. Semi-structured interviews identified ten primary influencing factors, which were further analyzed through a survey of 531 users to quantify the interrelationships among these factors. Results indicate that career paths and industry environment exert the most significant positive impact on designers’ behavioral intentions, highlighting the rising demand for AIGC and its potential to enhance career prospects. Output availability and cross-functional collaboration demonstrate practical benefits in improving content quality and team efficiency. Technological maturity and public acceptance serve as key adoption drivers, while social construction and innovation underscore AI’s capacity to foster creativity and design diversity. Ethics and privacy reflect user concerns over data security, whereas learning costs negatively affect adoption due to perceived complexity. This study confirms the utility of the TOE framework in guiding the deployment of AIGC technology and underscores the necessity of promoting AI’s sustainable development in design. It provides theoretical, practical, and policy recommendations, including improving the usability and innovation of AIGC tools, strengthening support for team collaboration, and offering career development training for designers. Furthermore, policymakers are urged to address privacy and ethical challenges to ensure the long-term sustainable adoption of AI. This research delivers critical theoretical and practical insights into integration of AIGC in the design field.},

However, with AI’s increasing presence across various domains, including medicine, concerns have arisen regarding the use of the term itself. In this study, we conducted a systematic review to identify papers defining "AI hallucination" across fourteen databases. We present and analyze definitions obtained from all databases, categorize them based on their applications, and extract key points within each category. Our results highlight a lack of consistency in how the term is used, but also help identify several alternative terms in the literature. We discuss the implications of these findings and call for a more unified effort to bring consistency to this important contemporary AI issue, which can significantly affect multiple domains.},

  title={DLS-GAN: Generative Adversarial Nets for Defect Location Sensitive Data Augmentation}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={21},
  number={4},
  pages={5173-5189},
  abstract={Limited data usually cause deep neural networks to hold poor performance after training, and many generative models are proposed to synthesize data to improve the performance of models. However, existing models ignore capturing the small defect details (e.g., features and locations), resulting in that most models cannot augment the Defect Location Sensitive Data (DLS data) in which the ratio of object size to the image size is small (e.g., 20%) and the locations of the defects are only on the object. In this paper, we propose a new augmentation model, named Defect Location Sensitive data augmentation GAN (DLS-GAN), to address DLS data augmentation problem. First, we modify the vanilla generator with two Encoder-Decoder models, and view the limited masked-images masked by labeling the defect-free pixels while remaining the defect pixels in defect images and many defect-free images as the input of the two models. The extracted feature map from the first Encoder-Decoder model provides the defect features and location information; the second one extracts the features of defect-free images, and integrates the two different features with a designed Defect Feature Transfer Module to synthesize images with desired defects. Second, we employ two discriminators to estimate the scores of both distribution matching degree and defect similarity between real data and generated ones. With the two modifications, we design a new loss function, and then prove that it makes our model get converged. Last, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the significant performance improvement and generalizability of DLS-GAN on different types of DLS datasets. The experimental results show that our DLS-GAN outperforms the SOTA generative models in terms of synthesizing high quality images with desired defects. Note to Practitioners—Automated defect image detectors play an important role in the field of automated manufacturing. Training a detector with superior detection performance usually requires a large number of samples. However, it is difficult to collect many defect samples in practice. Although existing generative methods can synthesize realistic-like images, they cannot generate the Defect Location Sensitive Data (DLS Data) which refer to the samples that the defects appear at the specific locations in product objects, resulting in the synthesized images invalid. This paper proposes a new defect image generation model called DLS-GAN to address this problem, and validates its performance in different real-world industrial datasets ranging from DLS Data to Non-DLS Data. Such generated images can be adopted as useful resources for improving the detection performance of automated detector.},

  year={2023},
  volume={34},
  number={11},
  pages={9389-9403},
  abstract={Video anomaly detection (VAD) refers to the discrimination of unexpected events in videos. The deep generative model (DGM)-based method learns the regular patterns on normal videos and expects the learned model to yield larger generative errors for abnormal frames. However, DGM cannot always do so, since it usually captures the shared patterns between normal and abnormal events, which results in similar generative errors for them. In this article, we propose a novel self-supervised framework for unsupervised VAD to tackle the above-mentioned problem. To this end, we design a novel self-supervised attentive generative adversarial network (SSAGAN), which is composed of the self-attentive predictor, the vanilla discriminator, and the self-supervised discriminator. On the one hand, the self-attentive predictor can capture the long-term dependences for improving the prediction qualities of normal frames. On the other hand, the predicted frames are fed to the vanilla discriminator and self-supervised discriminator for performing true–false discrimination and self-supervised rotation detection, respectively. Essentially, the role of the self-supervised task is to enable the predictor to encode semantic information into the predicted normal frames via adversarial training, in order for the angles of rotated normal frames can be detected. As a result, our self-supervised framework lessens the generalization ability of the model to abnormal frames, resulting in larger detection errors for abnormal frames. Extensive experimental results indicate that SSAGAN outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, which demonstrates the validity and advancement of SSAGAN.},

  abstract={Designing a logo is a long, complicated, and expensive process for any designer. However, recent advancements in generative algorithms provide models that could offer a possible solution. Logos are multi-modal, have very few categorical properties, and do not have a continuous latent space. Yet, conditional generative adversarial networks can be used to generate logos that could help designers in their creative process. We propose LoGAN: an improved auxiliary classifier Wasserstein generative adversarial neural network (with gradient penalty) that is able to generate logos conditioned on twelve different colors. In 768 generated instances (12 classes and 64 logos per class), when looking at the most prominent color, the conditional generation part of the model has an overall precision and recall of 0.8 and 0.7 respectively. LoGAN's results offer a first glance at how artificial intelligence can be used to assist designers in their creative process and open promising future directions, such as including more descriptive labels which will provide a more exhaustive and easy-to-use system.},

  abstract={Gearbox plays a role in mechanical equipment such as power transmission, speed, and torque conversion. However, in large and complex industrial scenarios, the acquisition of gearbox fault data is often expensive, and relying on a small amount of fault data to achieve intelligent fault identification is a challenging task. To address this challenge, we propose an intelligent diagnosis method based on Attention Conditional Regularized Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks (ACLGAN). First, the diversity of original samples is increased by introducing an overlapping segmentation strategy. Then, based on the least squares loss function, the conditional regularization term is incorporated to alleviate the issues of unstable model training, disappearing gradient, and exploding gradient. At the same time, the Conditional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM) is adopted to further enhance the quality of the generated samples. Finally, the real samples and the obtained fake samples are fed into the designed classifier based on deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to realize fault diagnosis. We validated the applicability of ACLGAN using the PHM2009 gearbox dataset, and the results show that the intelligent diagnosis method based on ACLGAN can generate high quality simulation data and better recognize six various fault states of gearboxes.},

  abstract={Malign influence campaigns leveraging cyber capabilities have caused significant political disruption in the United States and elsewhere; but the next generation of campaigns could be considerably more damaging as a result of the widespread use of machine learning.Current methods for successfully waging these campaigns depend on labour-intensive human interaction with targets. The introduction of machine learning, and potentially artificial intelligence (AI), will vastly enhance capabilities for automating the reaching of mass audiences with tailored and plausible content. Consequently, they will render malicious actors even more powerful.Tools for making use of machine learning in information operations are developing at an extraordinarily rapid pace, and are becoming rapidly more available and affordable for a much wider variety of users. Until early 2018 it was assumed that the utilisation of AI methods by cyber criminals was not to be expected soon, because those methods rely on vast datasets, correspondingly vast computational power, or both, and demanded highly specialised skills and knowledge. However, in 2019 these assumptions proved invalid, as datasets and computing power were democratised and freely available tools obviated the need for special skills. It is reasonable to assume that this process will continue, transforming the landscape of deception, disinformation and influence online.This article assesses the state of AI-enhanced cyber and information operations in late 2019 and investigates whether this may represent the beginnings of substantial and dangerous trends over the next decade. Areas to be considered include: social media campaigns using deepfakes; deepfake-enabled CEO fraud; machine-generated political astroturfing; and computers responding to the emotional state of those interacting with them, enabling automated, artificial humanoid disinformation campaigns.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},

  pages={3907-3914},
  abstract={AC machines may be subjected to different electrical or mechanical faults during their operation. Fault patterns can be detected in the DC current from the machine's E-Drive system with the help of Deep or Machine Learning algorithms. However, Deep or Machine Learning algorithms require large amounts of dataset for training and without the availability of a large dataset the algorithms fail to generalize or give their optimal performance. Collecting large amounts of data from faulty machine can be a tedious task. It is expensive and not always possible. In some cases, the machine is completely damaged even before sufficient amount of data can be collected. Also, data collection from defected machine may cause permanent damage to the connected system. Therefore, in this paper the problem of small dataset is tackled by presenting a methodology for large dataset generation by using the well-known generative model, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). As an example, the stator open circuit fault in a synchronous machine is considered. DC currents from the machine's E-Drive system are measured from different healthy and faulty machines and are used for training of two 1d DCGANs (Deep Convolutional GANs), one for the healthy and the other for the current signal from the faulty machine. Conventional GANs are difficult to train, however in this paper, training parameters of 1d DCGAN are tuned which results an improved training process. The performance of generator during the training of 1d DCGAN is evaluated by using the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) metric. The proposed 1d DCGAN model is said to converge when FID score between the real and generated signal reaches below a certain threshold. The generated signals from the trained 1d DCGAN are further evaluated using the PDF (Probability Density Function), frequency domain analysis and other measures which check for duplication of the real data and their statistical diversity. The trained 1d DCGAN is able to generate DC current signals for building large datasets for the training of Deep or Machine learning models.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a recommendation system to improve resume tracking and provide personalized job suggestions, focusing on contributing to sustainable hiring practices. In today's job market, many candidates struggle to find roles that match their skills, leading to inefficient job searches. Our system uses Generative artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP), and web scraping to analyze resumes and match them with relevant job descriptions. By automating these processes, the system not only increases the accuracy of job matching but also reduces the manual effort required from job seekers and recruiters. This contributes to sustainability by saving time, lowering resource consumption, and reducing the environmental impact of traditional hiring methods. The system also supports economic sustainability by helping individuals find suitable employment faster, promoting inclusive growth, and reducing unemployment. The results indicate that this approach improves job matching accuracy, making recruitment processes more efficient and helping candidates enhance their visibility in automated hiring systems. Overall, this system fosters a more sustainable and effective job market aligned with global sustainability goals.},

  abstract={The advancement in education has emphasized the need to evaluate the quality of the examination questions and the cognitive levels of students. Many educational institutions now acknowledge Bloom’s taxonomy-based students’ cognitive levels evaluating subject-related learning. Therefore, in this paper, a novel optimized Examination Question Classification framework, referred to as QC-DcCapsGAN-AOSA, is proposed by combining the Dual-channel Capsule generative Adversarial Network (DcCapsGAN) with Atomic Orbital Search Algorithm (AOSA) for preprocessing a real-time online dataset of university examination questions, thus identify the key features from the raw data using Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and finally classifying the examination questions. Atomic Orbital Search Algorithm is used to fine-tune the parameters’ weights of the DcCapsGAN, and then uses these weights to categorize questions as Knowledge Level, Comprehension Level, Application Level, Analysis Level, Synthesis Level, and Evaluation Level. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method (QC-DcCapsGAN-AOSA) when compared to the state-of-the-art methods such as QC-LSTM-CNN and QC-BiGRU-CNN with an accuracy improvement of 23.65% and 29.04%, respectively.},

  abstract={The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with the Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed numerous domains through the AI of Things (AIoT). Nonetheless, AIoT encounters issues related to energy usage and carbon emissions as mobile technology continues to progress. Generative AI (GAI) possesses significant potential to mitigate carbon emissions associated with AIoT, owing to its higher reasoning and generative powers. Conventional security protocols frequently encounter issues with computational efficiency, latency, and overall security comprehensiveness. Blockchain technology, characterized by its decentralized and immutable properties, is a viable approach for improving electronic healthcare data transmission and node authentication in IoT networks. This research examines secure data transmission and node encryption in IoT systems, with a particular emphasis on data management. Conventional approaches encounter constraints in computational efficiency, latency, and comprehensive security. This study presents a novel protocol that combines GAI and blockchain technology with quantum encryption to enhance authentication and ensure secure data transmission. The algorithm comprises multiple consecutive processes, including the encoding and transmission of node requests, followed by the authentication process utilizing hash functions and digital signatures. The authentication approach utilizes a challenge-response technique, guaranteeing that only nodes with authentic credentials can advance. Thereafter, a dynamic key exchange protocol and quantum encryption method provide secure data delivery. The results indicate the procedure’s effectiveness in ensuring secure and regulated access to patient data, underscoring its significance in medical facilities. The system’s functionalities are augmented by a thorough evaluation employing machine learning. The findings indicate that the system exhibits an accuracy of 99.4%, precision of 99.10%, recall of 98.66%, F1-score of 98.50%, and security of 99.2%. An extensive analysis and comparison with the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the significant advancements of the suggested method in tackling cryptographic security challenges. The algorithm offers a thorough approach to protecting IoT applications, especially in managing healthcare data.},

Data were collected from 29 students in mainland China through video recordings of their gameplay. Challenges were defined based on their duration and students' responses that contradicted predefined correct answers, resulting in the identification of 29 challenges. Findings indicated that students encountered student-related challenges including linguistic misinterpretation, distraction, cognitive overload, student misbeliefs, and inappropriate attitudes; teacher-related challenges such as lack of support and inadequate access to teaching and technological resources; and technology-related challenges including external and internal malfunctions.

In this article, we propose a new image-based path planning algorithm to overcome traditional design concepts based on complex topological networks. Specifically, a novel feedback generative adversarial network learning model with channel-space attention (CSA-FGAN) is developed to search and plan an optimal path. It is worth noting that the input and output of the proposed feedback learning model are RGB images with complex spatial obstacle environment maps and RGB images with feasible paths, respectively. In particular, in order to further enhance the feature extraction ability and path prediction accuracy of image data, the feedback attention mechanism controls and improves the depth of the network by forming a closed loop of the proposed learning model. Final, three application scenario image examples are conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed path planning policy.},

  abstract={Conventional methods of keyword-based search engines can be incomplete, erroneous, and even lead to information overload. We suggest a multi-agent (AI-based) scientific literature retrieval system with features of semantic search, adaptive personalization, and intelligent recommendation. The backend, designed with FastAPI, follows a hybrid retrieval strategy that combines BM25 for sparse indexing and FAISS for searching dense vectors. The architecture consists of three agents: Query Agent, which will expand and refine the user input; a Retrieval Agent, which retrieves documents from local and external repositories; and Learning Agent, which will update performance based on user activity. The experimental evaluation reveals that our system achieved an 8.5% improvement in precision, a 7.3% improvement in recall, and a reduction of about 210ms in response latency compared to published retrieval systems such as PaperQA and Semantic Scholar. In addition, with the use of Sentence-Transformers we achieved better semantic similarity matching, enabling us to provide better recommendations with citations. The team provided a multi-agent architecture with an examples of how retrieval-augmented generative search engines can advance personalized, efficient research discovery for the scientific community.

  abstract={Acute ischemic stroke is a leading cause of mortality among time-critical diseases. Fast and accurate assessment of affected brain tissue is crucial for effective treatment planning. Decisions are often made under pressure by combining multi-modal data, including computed tomography perfusion (CTP) providing 4-dimensional (4D) data on cerebral hemodynamics. Stressful decision-making in a narrow time window can be managed with structured training and artificial intelligence-driven decision support tools. Synthetic CTP data can be used in stroke simulation tools for clinical training, protecting patient privacy and serving as augmented data for training a machine learning model in stroke classification and segmentation. Deep generative models, particularly generative adversarial networks (GANs), are powerful tools for synthesizing medical images. This study investigates various GAN architectures to create high-resolution 4D CTP datasets, where among those models hierarchical amortized GAN successfully synthesized 4D CTP data with FID of 1.26. This demonstrates the ability to replicate brain structures and perfusion dynamics, although further refinements in temporal modeling are needed for clinical use.},

  abstract={A number of natural and social systems often demonstrate emergent behaviours resulting from limited local interactions among their constituent parts. The emergent and self-organizing behaviours seen in many such distributed systems are closely congruent to the phenomenon of collective intelligence. Emergence and self-organization often occur together and appear to be subsumed within a broader framework of collective intelligence in distributed systems. Collective intelligence, the ability of a group to exhibit greater intelligence than its individual members, is result of various distributed interaction mechanisms, which are quite similar to the so-far identified mechanisms and underlying structures of emergence and self-organization. This paper presents a short analytical survey of the concepts and characteristic properties of emergence, self-organization and collective intelligence and tries to establish the strong similarity and inter-relatedness in them. The complex non-linear dynamics found in systems exhibiting these properties is not reducible to individual parts and therefore require a generative modeling approach of analysis. The Agent-based modeling and simulation approach seems the most suitable choice, as is also demonstrated through an example of agent-based simulation of obstacle handling in a collective setting.},

The adversarial generative networks seem to have an excellent performance generating time series indistinguishable from real series. It has been shown that a probabilistic prediction of time series called ForGAN adversary generative network has been successfully used for one-step-ahead predictions. In this work, a modified architecture of ForGAN with multiple outputs is proposed in order to perform multiple-step-ahead predictions. We show by means of experiments using a real dataset that statistically significant improvement of multiple-step-ahead predictions with the proposed modified architecture of ForGAN compared with the use of the original ForGAN network is achieved, decreasing RMSE by 17.6% and CRPS by 17.3% when predicting 5 steps ahead.},

  abstract={In the six generation (6 G) era, semantic communication is regarded as a highly promising communication paradigm, which is expected to break through the performance bottlenecks of traditional communications and drive the innovation of communication technologies. As an emerging communication paradigm, semantic communication is vulnerable to eavesdropping threats. Currently, most secure semantic communication works focus on the image reconstruction security at the receiver, ignoring the performance security of downstream artificial intelligence (AI) tasks. In this paper, we propose a secure semantic communication system based on generative adversarial network (GAN). Specifically, we integrate generative adversarial network into the semantic communication architecture to reduce the image reconstruction quality of the eavesdropper. Then, we design a secure semantic feature loss function based on the semantic-level information required for the downstream AI task to mitigate the eavesdropper’s capability to preserve task-related semantic information. In addition, we propose a novel FPSNR metric based on the traditional Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) metric to better evaluate the system secure performance from semantic perspective. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly ensure the performance security of the downstream AI task.},

  abstract={The idea of person centric networking has been around for a while, but it has faced a number of key challenges in gaining widespread adoption. As the number of connected devices, and particularly personally connected, devices continues to increase exponentially the complexity and security challenges of traditional network approaches will require a shift from provider centric to user centric networking. The challenges to adoption of person centric networking have primarily been around ease-of-use, ease-of-configuration and ease of service portability. Generative AI is showing the potential to address these issues by providing mechanisms to dynamically engage and create configurations and solutions that previously required detailed engineering effort. The experience of users today is of a mountainous network of different networks, services and providers. This paper covers how Generative AI developments are already impacting certain areas and what is required for the shift from physical to person centric to be complete and present people with a "personal flat earth" from a networking perspective.},

In order to tackle this issue, researchers have developed sustainable defense strategies, but certain challenges remain. These challenges involve transferability, higher computing costs, and adaptability. Striking a balance between accuracy and robustness is difficult, as defense mechanisms often come with trade-offs between the two. Real-world situations demonstrate the practical implications of sustainable adversarial AI. For example, it improves the security of self-driving vehicles, enhances the accuracy of medical imaging diagnoses, and incorporates AI-driven defenses into network intrusion detection and phishing detection systems. It is crucial to consider ethical aspects throughout this process. Future trends in adversarial AI research for cybersecurity will involve ensemble defense mechanisms, adversarial learning from limited data, and hybrid attacks. By embracing the evolving landscape, researchers and practitioners can develop sustainable AI systems that are more secure and resilient, effectively countering adversarial threats.},

  abstract={The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is revolutionizing diagnosis and patient care by improving clinical documentation and the management of electronic health records that depend on medical image interpretation, increasing accuracy, and reducing time. Egypt ranks first in liver disease and second in liver cancer mortality worldwide in 2020. Large language models, a subset of AI techniques, can assist in disease diagnosis. LLM models with multimodal capabilities can classify and describe patient scan images and extract information from clinical notes. These models can extract vital diagnoses with the support of prompt engineering, as one of these models can answer questions, summarize information, and translate complex medical terminology into plain language, enabling patients to understand their medical reports and diagnoses. There are two primary approaches to achieving this. First, fine-tuning can adapt the model to medical data, which can be resource-intensive. The second approach, pre-trained LLM models can be utilized to leverage pre-trained models to perform the necessary tasks, focusing on effectively using prompts to guide the model for precise and relevant outputs. This study highlights the role of generative AI models by focusing on prompt engineering, and how carefully crafting prompts can enhance the effectiveness of LLM models in medical applications with high accuracy. It demonstrates this through experiments using pre-trained models based on semantic similarity with GPT-4o and BioGPT. Implementing a zero-shot model for liver tumor classification is one of the prompt engineering techniques. The performance metrics achieved were impressive, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores are 88, 81, 88, and 83 percent, respectively.},

  abstract={In this paper, I present a novel approach for dynamically transforming Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) content to create mobile-friendly web pages using generative AI. Traditional methods for responsive web design rely on pre-defined Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) frameworks and media queries to adjust the layout and appearance of web content for different devices. These methods often require significant manual effort and do not always accommodate the dynamic and complex nature of modern web applications, particularly those with interactive elements. My approach leverages a fine-tuned Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) model to intelligently adapt and transform HTML content, including complex elements like dropdowns, forms, and other interactive components, to enhance usability on mobile devices. By automating the transformation process, this method reduces the need for extensive manual intervention, providing a scalable and efficient solution for maintaining responsive web applications. I offer a thorough explanation of the process, outlining the specific stages of data preparation, model training, and deployment. Through experiments and results, I demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in various scenarios, showcasing significant improvements in user experience and interaction on mobile devices. This paper contributes to the field of web development by introducing an AI-driven solution that addresses the limitations of traditional responsive design techniques, paving the way for more adaptive and intelligent web content transformation.},

  abstract={Deep learning (DL) algorithms are swiftly finding applications in computer vision and natural language processing. Nonetheless, they can also be employed for creating convincing deepfakes, which are challenging to distinguish from reality. The advancements in image and video technology and tools, especially on social media platforms, potentially lead to misuse for malicious purposes like blackmail or defamation. To tackle this issue, several group of researchers tried upon spreading or creating awareness on real or fake data. The proposed approach involves combining Deepfake generation using GANs and Autoencoders with a Deepfake detection method. The aim of this initiative is exclusively to combat disinformation and online fraud for the welfare of the general population. Deepfakes, products of AI, have become increasingly realistic, rendering it nearly difficult to distinguish the content. Auto-encoders with sufficient time can achieve about 92 % accuracy. As the generator improves, the discriminator performance worsens as it struggles to differentiate real or fake data. A perfect generator results in 50% accuracy. With advancements in computational capacity and data availability, the proposed DDM (Deepfake Detection Model) has achieved greater accuracy rate of up to 92.3%.},

  abstract={In the past few years, the development of "Deepfake" videos, which are defined by the use of free software tools based on deep learning, has enabled the production of credible face exchanges in videos with minimum evidence of manipulation. Artificial intelligence-altered videos which have gained widespread attention are known as "Deepfake" videos. They are employed to highly realistically manipulate content (audio, video, and image) to create an appearance that a person said or did something they never actually did. The purpose of these deepfake videos is to spread disinformation about people, including governments and personalities, through the use of deep learning algorithms. These films have been intentionally made global with the aim of frightening people, spreading misinformation and marketing, and disrupting society. Deepfake technology uses algorithms like Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to produce artificial images or videos that look realistic. In GANs, a generator and discriminator collaborate to produce phony images or videos that have an authentic look. DeepFaceLab is a free tool for creating deepfakes with a lot of generating flexibility. A deepfake video is quite hard for an average viewer to identify. In order to improve the performance of deepfake detection, we proposed a novel MesoNet approach in this research study that can effectively identify photographs as real or fake. The results of the experiment showed that the enhanced classifier (Meso) network model performed about 90% in terms of identifying real from false photographs.},

  abstract={There exists three main areas of study inside of the field of predictive maintenance: anomaly detection, fault diagnosis, and remaining useful life prediction. Notably, anomaly detection alerts the stakeholder that an anomaly is occurring. This raises two fundamental questions: what is causing the fault and how can we fix it? Inside of the field of explainable artificial intelligence, counterfactual explanations can give that information in the form of what changes to make to put the data point into the opposing class, in this case "healthy." The suggestions are not always actionable which may raise the interest in asking "what if we do this instead?" In this work, we provide a proof of concept for utilizing counterfactual explanations as what-if analysis. We perform this on the PRONOSTIA dataset with a temporal convolutional network as the anomaly detector. Our method presents the counterfactuals in the form of a what-if analysis for this base problem to inspire future work for more complex systems and scenarios.},

  abstract={This article investigates how contemporary technologies are revolutionizing industrial design, with an emphasis on innovations such as AI (artificial intelligence), smart manufacturing systems, and digital prototyping tools in relation to product attractiveness and competitiveness in the marketplace. Through analyzing aesthetic value, consumer sentiment, and production efficiency as benchmarks of analysis, the research emphasizes the crucial benefits that technology-embedded design techniques can provide when compared to traditional design practices. AI-driven designs that use Decision trees, support vector machines, and gradient boosting regressors consistently shine above traditional designs, whether it is for user engagement or visual aesthetics. Additionally, implementing next generation manufacturing processes leads to shorter production cycles, lower prototyping costs, and less production errors.

  abstract={In the medical domain, it is difficult to retrieve large datasets. Classic data augmentation methods such as flipping, rotating, and scaling, are helpful in classification tasks, but these methods usually are not good enough to increase diversities and variances in small datasets. In this study, we applied AC-GAN (Auxiliary Classifier GANs) for data augmentation of our Limb X-ray dataset. We pre-trained the model for hip fracture detection of our Pelvic X-ray dataset by utilizing transfer learning with the augmented Limb X-ray dataset, which contained both the original dataset and realistic synthetic images made by the AC-GAN. The final hip fracture classification results of the Pelvic X-ray dataset showed that our generative model not only succeeded in producing realistic Limb X-ray data but also helped improve the performance of the transfer learning model for hip fracture detection.},

  abstract={In the upcoming 6G era, with the deployment of massive Multi-input Multi-output (MIMO) systems, collecting and capturing 6G channel data through traditional channel modeling methods is very expensive. In addition, wireless communication carriers continuously propose and use artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) based wireless communication solutions. Implementing such AI and DL based solutions requires a certain amount of high-quality channel data as a prerequisite. Traditional channel modeling methods cannot meet the requirements of simulating or collecting channel data rapidly and efficiently. In this paper, a generative network for channel modeling and signal generation, two data augmentation methods and a training technique are proposed. In short, this paper covers how to improve the performance of generative networks and how to generate high quality data with the premise that a large amount of channel samples are limited. Finally, the experimental results show that our proposed network could effectively and quickly generate 6G channel data by achieving the highest final score on both simple and complex testset. And the simulation results show that the generated data by our proposed structure has consistent normalized power with the real data. And the generated data can support a wide variety of AI-based wireless communication tasks.},

  abstract={Failure detection is a useful tool in the industry to improve system performance and reduce costs due to unexpected malfunction events. However, it is usual that there are few datasets about nominal or failure operating behavior of a system, which difficult the correct training and validation of automated failure detection methods. This paper proposes a methodology to perform failure detection on Ball-Bearing joints for rotational shafts using deep learning techniques called FaultFace. The vibration time series of the motor shaft is acquired as an indicative signal and is transformed into a 2D image representation called face portrait using Continuous Wavelet Transformation. Considering that the dataset is reduced and unbalanced, a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network is employed to produce new face portraits of the nominal and failure behaviors to obtain a balanced dataset. Based on the newly generated dataset, a Convolutional Neural Network is trained for fault detection. The confusion matrix is employed as a performance index for the classification algorithm. Obtained results show that this methodology reaches a 98% of accuracy for failure detection on the ball-bearing joint.},

  pages={271-275},
  abstract={Image style transfer technique is a popular topic in computer vision. This paper proposes a reconstructed generator model based on Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) for image style transfer tasks. Firstly, deep feature interpolation is performed to extract image high-level semantic representations in deep feature space, and then it is combined with CycleGAN to construct a new deep network model. In this model, the generator network is organized by sampling layers and residual modules. According to the above process, a new deep feature generator is designed to realize the cross-region style transfer. Experiments are carried out on several standard datasets, horse2zebr, monet2photo and summer2winter. The model is evaluated through the objective evaluation indicators of PSNR and SSIM. Experimental results show a better performance improvement compared to the classical CycleGAN.},

  abstract={Conventional methods of real time sound effects in 3D graphical and virtual environments relied upon preparing all the needed samples ahead of time and simply replaying them as needed, or parametrically modifying a basic set of samples using physically based techniques such as the spring-damper simulation and modal analysis/synthesis. In this work, we propose to apply the generative adversarial network (GAN) approach to the problem at hand, with which only one generator is trained to produce the needed sounds fast with perceptually indifferent quality. Otherwise, with the conventional methods, separate and approximate models would be needed to deal with different material properties and contact types, and manage real time performance. We demonstrate our claim by training a GAN (more specifically WaveGAN) with sounds of different drums and synthesizing the sounds on the fly for a virtual drum playing environment. The perceptual test revealed that the subjects could not discern the synthesized sounds from the ground truth nor perceived any noticeable delay upon the corresponding physical event.},

  abstract={The method of using experimental data as a training dataset to train deep neural networks for sensor measurement error compensation has aroused widespread research interest among researchers. Due to the difficulty and high cost of experiments, the sensor measurement data obtained through experiments is limited. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve the compensating method for sensor measurement errors by training deep neural networks with sufficient experimental data. In the case of limited sensor experimental data, a generative deep neural network is used in this paper to simulate the obtained limited amount of experimental data and generate a sufficient amount of experimental data. A mixed dataset is constructed using real experimental data and generated experimental data to complete the training of the error compensation network and achieve the correction of sensor measurement results. By comparing the sensor results corrected by measurement error correction model trained by original experimental data and the mixed data, it can be proven that the mixed data trained measurement error correction model has a better compensation effect on measurement errors.},

  abstract={As the track frequency shifted signals will cause signal mistranslation when subjected to interference. Therefore, it is very important to achieve the correct recognition of lowfrequency information in the case of noise, but the signal mistranslation caused by noise interference in the field is episodic, and a large number of datasets cannot be used for model training. In this paper, we propose to use Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN) to achieve the data expansion of the signal, which provides the data basis for the classification and recognition of the signal.

  abstract={Sparse - view projection in cone - beam CT (CBCT) cuts dose and time but causes streak artifacts. Sinogram inpainting can generate missing data for better image quality. A residual encoder-decoder generative adversarial network (Pix2pixGAN) is proposed for sparse - view CBCT reconstruction. It replaces the U - Net generator with a residual encoder - decoder module and uses a PatchGAN - based discriminator. Trained with real CBCT data, Pix2pixGAN was tested at 1/2, 1/3, and 1/4 sparse sampling, compared with linear interpolation and the original Pix2pixGAN. Results show it performs best, especially at 1/4 sampling. In the sinogram domain, RMSE reduces by 7.2%, PSNR increases by 1.5%, and SSIM improves by 1.4%. In the reconstruction image domain, RMSE drops by 5.4%, PSNR rises by 1.6%, and SSIM improves by 1.0%. In conclusion, Pix2pixGAN is suitable for high - quality sparse - angle CBCT reconstruction and has potential for fast, low - dose scanning.},

  abstract={Medical images are essential in healthcare, but their large file sizes present challenges for storage and transmission. This study proposes a framework for compressing color medical images while preserving key visual information. We apply three compression models: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-Means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and evaluate their performance based on Compression Ratio (CR), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). K-Means with 100 clusters outperforms the other models, achieving the highest compression (CR of 1.20), with excellent image quality (PSNR of 66.77 dB, SSIM of 1.0000). PCA shows moderate performance with a CR of 2.45, while GAN provides the least effective compression and image quality. These results demonstrate that K-Means offers the best trade-off between compression and image fidelity.},

  abstract={This paper presents a new approach for robotically colourizing grayscale photographs with the use of Generative antagonistic Networks (GANs). First, an encoderdecoder neural community is used to generate a low-resolution colourized version of the grayscale image. This preliminary output is then delicate via a GAN, which includes a generator community and a discriminator network. The generator network takes the low-decision colourized picture as entered and generates a higher-resolution model. The discriminator network takes the high-decision version of the colourized photograph and the authentic grayscale photograph as inputs and determines which picture is more genuine. Using comments from the discriminator, the generator is capable of generating better-resolution versions of the picture that greater carefully resemble the unique. The results show that GANs can be used for picture colourization with suitable results.},

  abstract={An automatic segmentation algorithm based on a generative adversarial network was proposed to solve the problems of insufficient segmentation, fuzzy segmentation, boundary ambiguity, and low segmentation accuracy in the existing liver tumor CT image segmentation methods. The algorithm first performs liver pre-segmentation on CT images to reduce the influence of irrelevant information. Secondly, the generation network of GAN uses Dual Attention Unet (DAUnet), which introduces a dual attention mechanism in the jump connection to enhance the characteristics of liver tumors. Finally, the prediction accuracy of tumor images is improved by GAN-generated adversarial training, and a mixed loss function is introduced in the training process. Finally, experimental results on LiTS data show that the proposed algorithm’s Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) value reaches 76.15%, 3.63% higher than that of the Unet algorithm. DAUnet can effectively improve the performance of tumor segmentation in liver images by generating adversarial training.},

  pages={662-666},
  abstract={Speech enhancement generative adversarial network (SEGAN) is an end-to-end deep learning architecture, which only uses the clean speech as the training targets. However, when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is very low, predicting clean speech signals could be very difficult as the speech is dominated by the noise. In order to address this problem, in this paper, we propose a gated convolutional neural network (CNN) SEGAN (GSEGAN) with noise prior knowledge learning to address this problem. The proposed model not only estimates the clean speech, but also learns the noise prior knowledge to assist the speech enhancement. In addition, gated CNN has an excellent potential for capturing long-term temporal dependencies than regular CNN. Motivated by this, we use a gated CNN architecture to acquire more detailed information at waveform level instead of regular CNN. We evaluate the proposed method GSEGAN on Voice Bank corpus. Experimental results show that the proposed method GSEGAN outperforms the SEGAN baseline, with a relative improvement of 0.7%, 28.2% and 43.9% for perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), overall Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNRovl) and Segmental Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNRseg), respectively.},

  abstract={In this paper, we consider the lifelong age progression and regression task, which requires to synthesize a person's appearance across a wide range of ages. We propose a simple yet effective learning framework to achieve this by exploiting the prior knowledge of faces captured by well-trained generative adversarial networks (GANs). Specifically, we first utilize a pretrained GAN to synthesize face images with different ages, with which we then learn to model the conditional aging process in the GAN latent space. Moreover, we also introduce a cycle consistency loss in the GAN latent space to preserve a person's identity. As a result, our model can reliably predict a person's appearance for different ages by modifying both shape and texture of the head. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over concurrent works. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach can also achieve high-quality age transformation for painting portraits and cartoon characters without additional age annotations.},

  title={When AI Facilitates Trust Violation: An Ethical Report on Deep Model Inversion Privacy Attack}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={929-935},
  abstract={This article raises concerns about the considerable capability of artificial intelligence in boosting privacy violations and motivates the necessity of AI ethics. Despite all AI advantages like the efficiency and accuracy of recent techniques, and its positive effects on our life quality, when it comes to security and privacy the facilities with AI empowerment have been met with anxiousness and distrust in the public. This article is an ethical view of the AI role in a recent work wherein AI considerably facilitates privacy violation in a gray-box attack on a deep face recognition system. While the user identities' data is fully secured and just the recognition deep model is accessible, AI-boosted model inversion reveals the faces of the identities via high-accuracy generated clones. An analytical and subjective evaluation of the generated face clones with and without AI integration in model inversion illustrates a big gap from non-clear noise face clones to crystal clear face clones which efficiently reveal the identity of a targeted user by their high-level naturalness, similarity, and recognizability amongst many users.},

  abstract={In the context of unsupervised home workouts, the provision of automated feedback is imperative to mitigate the risk of injuries. To date, the literature has not addressed the challenge of video input from a single smartphone camera, which is hindered by the presence of varying perspectives and occlusions. We extend existing approaches based on three-dimensional (3D) pose estimation and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with semi-supervised Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to robustly work with the noisy 3D coordinate approximations inferred from single-camera inputs. The SmartFit dataset has been developed to model variations in inputs in a natural manner by enabling test subjects to record themselves in arbitrary positions using their smartphones. It is only partly labeled to show the ease of extending our method with little labeled data. The efficacy of the semi-supervised model on the SmartFit dataset has been demonstrated by an 11.4 % higher mistake classification accuracy compared to the original, fully-supervised model.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Secure transfer of medical data over unsecured networks is a crucial concern in telemedicine, as it involves the transmission of sensitive patient information that must be protected from unauthorized access. Generative adversarial networks help in hiding arbitrary data in images while optimizing the quality of the images. In this study, we introduce a novel pipeline that classifies medical images, integrates the diagnosis with patient information, embeds the concatenated information in patient image data, and ensures robust sharing capabilities. The pipeline comprises of image classification and image steganography. Image classification employs fine-tuned state-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional models. Steganography makes use of encoder-decoder architecture to embed information on the image. These methods were tested on two medical datasets (X-ray and CT scans). Several models for classification were tested, of which fine-tuned Densenet121 achieved an accuracy and F1 score of 98.87 % and 98.8 % on X-ray respectively, and 98.1 % and 97.8 % on CT scans respectively. Similarly, for steganography our approach achieves payloads of 2.68 bits per pixel for $X$ ray image and 2.56 bits per pixel for chest CT scan, Peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) of 51.15 db for X-ray and 53.3 db for CT scan, and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) of 0.99 and 0.99 for X-ray and CT scan dataset respectively.},

  pages={129-133},
  abstract={This study explores the components of prompts generated by secondary school students when interacting with Generative AI (GenAI) chatbots in an AI education context. By analyzing the interaction logs between students and GenAI chatbots, this study identified and examined 6 components in students' prompts, separately “Focus”, “Verb”, “Persona”, “Context”, “Audience”, and “Constraints”. The results reveal students predominantly emphasized the components of “Focus” and “Verb” while displaying comparatively less attention to the other components. Through cluster analysis, the study categorizes students' prompts into five patterns, each reflecting different component strategies in prompt engineering. These findings enhance the understanding of students' interaction with GenAI chatbots and provide support for designing GenAIassisted education curricula, helping educators better comprehend students' epistemic and behavioral characteristics when interacting with GenAI, thereby optimizing teaching methods and course content.},

  pages={4027-4030},
  abstract={Aiming at the closed water detection in remote sensing imagery at medium-low resolution, this paper proposes a novel method for closed water detection based on fusion detection which conducts detection via informative fused images blended by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical images. Firstly, it utilizes SAR and optical image pairs containing the same closed water object to generate aligned image pairs according to latitude and longitude information. Next, generative adversarial network (GAN) is adopted to fuse two categories of images. At last, a target detection network driven by optical image samples is used to detect the closed water on the fused image. The experiment result on Sentinel-1&2 shows that the proposed method can effectively make up for the shortage of SAR image in closed water detection and improve the detection performance.},

  abstract={Continual learning consists in incrementally training a model on a sequence of datasets and testing on the union of all datasets. In this paper, we examine continual learning for the problem of sound classification, in which we wish to refine already trained models to learn new sound classes. In practice one does not want to maintain all past training data and retrain from scratch, but naively updating a model with new data(sets) results in a degradation of already learned tasks, which is referred to as "catastrophic forgetting." We develop a generative replay procedure for generating training audio spectrogram data, in place of keeping older training datasets. We show that by incrementally refining a classifier with generative replay a generator that is 4% of the size of all previous training data matches the performance of refining the classifier keeping 20% of all previous training data. We thus conclude that we can extend a trained sound classifier to learn new classes without having to keep previously used datasets.},
