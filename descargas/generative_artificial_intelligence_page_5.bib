  abstract={Urban water systems are increasingly strained by the impacts of climate change, growing populations, and resource constraints, driving the need for more integrated and sustainable management solutions. Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are central to driving this transformation, leveraging their adaptability and significant impact on the industry. However, many SMEs lack access to comprehensive Information Systems (ISs) that combine data on government policies, industry trends, and water management initiatives, limiting their ability to implement sustainable practices. This study introduces Sustain WaterBot, a Chatbot powered by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), including Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Sustain WaterBot bridges this information gap by seamlessly integrating data from diverse sources such as news outlets, government publications, industry reports, scientific studies, and social media platforms into a unified IS. It enhances decision-making by providing timely and relevant insights into Sustainable Urban Water Initiatives (SUWIs) through an interactive Question Answering (QA) framework. By leveraging open-source technologies, Sustain WaterBot offers SMEs an affordable, scalable, and sustainable tool to adopt eco-friendly water practices while improving operational efficiency and informed decision-making.},

  pages={6607-6620},
  abstract={Mobile-edge generation (MEG) is an emerging technology that allows the network to meet the challenging traffic load expectations posed by the rise of generative artificial intelligence (GAI). A novel MEG model is proposed for deploying GAI models on edge servers (ESs) and user equipment (UE) to jointly complete text-to-image generation tasks. In the generation task, the ES and UE will cooperatively generate the image according to the text prompt given by the user. To enable the MEG, a pretrained latent diffusion model (LDM) is invoked to generate the latent feature, and an edge-inferencing MEG protocol is employed for data transmission exchange between the ES and the UE. A compression coding technique is proposed for compressing the latent features to produce seeds. Based on the above seed-enabled MEG model, an image quality optimization problem with energy constraint is formulated. The transmitting power of the seed is dynamically optimized by a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent over the fading channel. The proposed MEG-enabled text-to-image generation system is evaluated in terms of image quality and transmission overhead. The numerical results indicate that, compared to the conventional centralized generation-and-downloading scheme, the symbol number of the transmission of MEG is materially reduced. In addition, the proposed compression coding approach can improve the quality of generated images under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, and the DRL-enabled dynamic power control further improves the image quality under the energy constraint compared to static transmit power control.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has revolutionized higher education with features like instant feedback, resource and material creation, adaptive learning, interactivity, and more. However, GAI also brings with it a number of serious challenges that raise ethical and moral concerns regarding academic integrity. To carry out this transition process, it will be necessary to develop clear guidelines that adhere to integrity standards and ethical codes of higher education institutions. In addition to offering responses to a number of research questions, the purpose of this study is to further the current discourse surrounding the moral guidelines for GAI in higher education. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) technique and Bibliometric Analysis using VOSviewer, 37 related research studies were reviewed and evaluated. The results demonstrate that the number of articles published has been increasing over time, with the largest number of scientific publications occurring in 2024. This can be explained by the fact that, despite the fact that GAI offers benefits and drawbacks for the educational sector, particularly for higher education, it also makes clear how important it is for professionals and organizations to use GAI tools in order to handle ethical issues by continuously developing policies. By creating norms and policies, future ethical problems with GAI in education may be more accurately predicted. The engagement and dedication of academic experts and other relevant stakeholders are essential to achieving this goal of increasing public awareness and effectively utilizing GAI technology.},

  pages={13367-13383},
  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) models are pretrained using extensive public data. However, in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain, distributed and heterogeneous data from end devices lacks contextual relations, which impairs IoT domain GAI training efficiency and leads to inaccurate applications. Nowadays, knowledge graph (KG) offers an effective solution for enhanced performance and interpretability of GAI. Nevertheless, specific data collection and KG creation in IoT scenarios still pose quality and cost challenges for GAI developers. Therefore, designing an effective IoT KG collection and trading strategy is needed to provide reliable knowledge support for IoT GAI from professional data providers. Currently, establishing fair KG pricing, the effective construction of knowledge relations in edge IoT scenarios and preventing data providers from accessing private information remain significant open issues for IoT KG trading. To address these issues, we propose an incentive distributed IoT knowledge market framework to facilitate effective and secure KG trading for IoT GAI. Specifically, first, we design a utility incentive and GAI demand-driven KG pricing strategy, which establishes a three-layer game with trading participants and KG embedding utility function to obtain fair pricing. Second, we devise a smart contract based distributed knowledge aggregation method, which provides collaborative IoT KG relation creation. Third, we propose a privacy-preserving KG construction scheme via homomorphic encryption that achieves consensus of encrypted KG to prevent knowledge providers from accessing IoT privacy. Finally, experimental results of real KG verify the KG-enhanced GAI and proposed market availability.},

  volume={},

  pages={1236-1241},
  abstract={Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a severe microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus, causing progressive retinal damage and, if left untreated, leading to permanent blindness. Early detection is critical for effective treatment; however, the current manual diagnostic process performed by ophthalmologists is both time-intensive and reliant on highly trained professionals. This approach faces numerous challenges, including its inefficiency in detecting early-stage DR and the growing global prevalence of the disease. To address these limitations, the adoption of automated, efficient, and accurate detection methods is imperative. Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) algorithms have significantly improved the performance of commercial DR detection systems, enabling more precise diagnoses. This study examines the challenges associated with traditional DR detection and classification, particularly in the early stages, and explores the transformative potential of generative artificial intelligence (GAI). By leveraging technologies like chat generative pre-trained transformers (e.g., ChatGPT), GAI can enhance clinical workflows by generating detailed medical reports, educating patients, and analyzing extensive datasets to uncover actionable insights. This research highlights the integration of GAI as a promising avenue for revolutionizing DR detection and management.},

  abstract={This paper examines the role of generative artificial intelligence (AI), in influencing employee well-being within the hospitality industry. Drawing upon the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model, the study delves into how diverse job demands and resources affect the well-being of hotel frontliners, while also testing the moderating influence of generative AI on this relationship. Employing an online survey methodology, primary data were gathered from 220 frontliners working in selected hotels in Makassar, Indonesia. The findings reveal a significant negative impact of job demands on employee well-being, underscoring the adverse effects of factors such as workload, time pressure, and emotional demands on hotel frontliners. Conversely, job resources are found to have a positive and significant influence on employee well-being, emphasizing the pivotal role of supportive factors such as autonomy, social support, and opportunities for skill development in enhancing well-being. Moreover, the study identifies generative AI as a noteworthy moderator in this context. These findings hold implications for both theoretical understanding and practical applications in human resource management within the hospitality industry. As the hospitality sector continues to integrate AI technologies, prioritizing employee well-being emerges as a critical factor in sustaining a motivated and productive workforce.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is increasingly used by professionals and students to support creative tasks, raising ethical concerns about originality, and transparency. In this paper, we examine the interaction between developers of GAI models and design students, focusing on the nexus between ethics and functionality. Using a design class example, we show how GAI models can help students efficiently and responsibly explore design alternatives by quantitatively assessing their designs' novelty relative to the training data. Through the presented framework, it becomes apparent that the ethical use of GAI models will also require developers to implement specific network architectures. However, the joint interaction will greatly promote transparency in the creative process, support fair monetization of a student's intellectual property, and facilitate the development of high-quality training datasets for future GAI models. By addressing these considerations, we aim to promote the responsible use of GAI in design education and beyond.},

  year={2024},

  pages={345-352},
  abstract={In recent years there have been significant advances in autonomous systems. Because they operate in complex and dynamic environments, these systems often integrate machine learning (ML)-based components, especially at the perception level. However, high-performance ML solutions require considerable amounts of data, and the resulting models are highly dependent on the training data. These models often leverage hidden patterns, known as dataset bias, that are not related to the concept that is being modeled, which, among other issues, limits the generalization and robustness of the models. Within the perception (images) domain, models trained on a specific dataset often fail to generalize to new datasets, despite the underlying concepts being the same. While various techniques have been proposed, such as diversity strategies, they fail to address the different biases in the data. This paper focuses on the issue of dataset biases for pedestrian classification, a core task for safety-critical autonomous systems. We evaluate the ML model’s generalization on four public reference datasets, along with the use of diversity strategies. To address the dataset biases, we then explore the use of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) techniques. The goal is to allow for the use of multiple large datasets to train a model for a given context, as well as tolerate drifts that might result from changes in the underlying system. Results show a noticeable improvement in the generalization performance of the models, highlighting the potential of such an approach.},

Employing a rigorous mixed-methods approach, the research combines a structured quantitative questionnaire exploring multiple dimensions of AI integration including pedagogical, scientific, institutional, and ethical uses with a qualitative experimental phase where faculty engage with standardized AI prompts to generate and analyze AI-produced content. The study aims to map declared usage patterns, evaluate perceived effects on teaching effectiveness and workload, and analyze disciplinary and seniority-based variations in adoption. Results reveal higher engagement and satisfaction among early-career faculty and those in engineering disciplines, alongside stronger ethical awareness, while more experienced faculty and those in literature fields report lower adoption. Quantitative analyses include descriptive statistics, ANOVA, factor analysis, and regression modeling, while qualitative data undergo thematic coding and natural language processing to identify recurrent usage themes and assess response quality.

  abstract={Learning programming in higher education faces significant challenges, including high dropout rates and difficulties in understanding abstract concepts. Previous studies have explored various teaching methods, but the effectiveness of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in this context has not yet been widely investigated. This study compares the efficacy of GenAI with video-based active learning methods for teaching programming to university students. Through an experimental design with 40 computer engineering students, academic performance, perception of usefulness and ease of use, and satisfaction and motivation were evaluated. The results showed no statistically significant differences between the groups in academic performance, perception of usefulness and ease of use, or satisfaction and motivation. Both methods proved equally effective in improving learning and maintaining student motivation. These findings suggest that GenAI can be a viable alternative to traditional methods, offering opportunities to diversify pedagogical strategies in programming education. Educators are encouraged to consider integrating GenAI to complement existing methods, ensuring implementation that maintains high levels of perceived control, immersion, and curiosity among students.},

  abstract={Despite the potential of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to unlock environmental sustainability, many firms still struggle to translate this potential into actionable practices. It is imperative to gain a deeper insight into the mechanisms by which GenAI unlocks environmental performance (EP). To tackle this issue, we propose a novel research framework grounded in resource orchestration theory (ROT). Drawing on survey responses from 260 high-tech manufacturing firms in China, we find that resource orchestration capabilities do not independently mediate the GenAI usage–EP relationship but instead require the support of decarbonization capabilities (DCs) to jointly serve as serial mediators. Moreover, environmental dynamism enhances the mediating effect of DCs in the GenAI usage–EP relationship. Our research elucidates the underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions associated with the use of GenAI to achieve environmental sustainability from the perspective of ROT, contributing to the field of technology-enabled management research. Our findings also provide valuable insights to guide firms in their transition towards carbon neutrality.},

  abstract={Ethical hacking and penetration testing is a vital task by cybersecurity professionals to find and exploit possible vulnerabilities in a system before malicious actors do. However, system hacking has a high barrier to entry that necessitates years of experiential learning and formal education. The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) may potentially lower the barrier to entry. This research experiments with automatic penetration testing via large language models (LLMs) augmented with security information. This research uses a locally hosted Mistral 7B model with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve penetration testing. When the LLMs are fine tuned with limited and unstructured security data such as privilege escalation articles from a few public web sites, the system succeeds in achieving privilege escalation on Linux hosts. The results of this research suggest that no-cost LLM-assisted penetration testing is possible even on ordinary PCs using locally hosted models. Future research is needed to achieve more diversified attacks and discover zero-day vulnerabilities, perhaps with better prompt engineering, models, and security data.},

  abstract={The integration of federated learning (FL) with the Internet of Things (IoT) represents an advanced technological trend, combining the extensive connectivity of IoT with the powerful processing capabilities of FL to drive innovation and optimization across multiple domains. Given the heterogeneity of IoT devices and the variability in data distribution, developing strategies to enhance FL performance without overly burdening resource-constrained devices is crucial. This article proposes an FL algorithm based on generative artificial intelligence (GAI) for IoT devices with extreme heterogeneity in data and resources. The algorithm utilizes pretrained GAI models to generate new data, aligning the data distributions of individual IoT devices closer to independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), thereby effectively reducing the heterogeneity of local data. Additionally, the proposed algorithm incorporates data synthesis and resource scheduling strategies to mitigate the heterogeneity of local device resources. Finally, we formulate a joint optimization problem aimed at minimizing total energy consumption while maximizing FL performance. Experimental results demonstrate that, under significant resource and data distribution disparities, most existing solutions struggle to converge, whereas the proposed method converges and achieves superior performance. Compared to existing GAI-based approaches, our method significantly reduces latency and energy consumption.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), with its powerful text generation capabilities, has shown significant potential in the field of education. This study focuses on the application of GAI in programming education, aiming to explore its impact on enhancing students' computational thinking. Through literature review, we found that the application of GAI in programming education is still in its early stages, with a lack of empirical research on its effectiveness. To address this gap, this study proposes a project-based learning model that integrates GAI to enhance students' computational thinking. The model is constructed by analyzing the components of computational thinking, the key elements of project-based learning, and the potential roles of GAI in this context. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, a quasi-experimental study was conducted. Independent samples t-tests were used to compare pre- and post-test results. The findings revealed a significant improvement in students' computational thinking after participating in the GAI-enhanced project-based learning activities. Specifically, significant differences were observed in the sub-dimensions of creativity, algorithmic thinking, and problem-solving ability. However, no significant differences were found in the sub-dimensions of collaborative ability and critical thinking.},

  abstract={With the rapid growth of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), we began to see the rise of deepfake content. This study aims to answer how exposure to GAI deep-fake content impacts digital consumers in psychological, social, and behavioral aspects, and how these impacts are represented in the literature, as well as to expose the potential social implications that GAI deepfake content has through a systematic literature review. The systematic literature review is done by summarizing 30 relevant articles from 2019 to 2024 that were methodically selected. VOSviewer is then used to create visualizations using the extracted data to help synthesize answers for the research question. The result of this study shows that the impact GAI deepfake content has is pre-dominantly negative, contributing to misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda. The research also identifies that deepfake is a relatively new technology that is ever-evolving, indicating that further research is needed.},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Diabetic retinopathy is a major cause of vision loss globally, and its early detection contributes to preventing complications. In this context, an architectural framework is proposed for retinal image generation in diabetic retinopathy. The generated images are subjected to a systematic clinical validation process conducted by ophthalmologists to assess their alignment with the clinical manifestations of diabetic retinopathy and enhance their applicability in pathology analysis. The dataset used for training, testing, and validating the generative model must possess an adequate volume and a balanced class distribution. High visual quality and accurate representation of the morphological features specific to each stage of diabetic retinopathy are fundamental elements for achieving the targeted outcomes. The developed architecture enables the synthesis of highly realistic retinal representations, supporting both the training of diagnostic models and the investigation of disease progression through generative artificial intelligence.},

  abstract={Nowadays, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is increasingly making inroads in Data Centers, helping to improve aspects related to latency and high speed. Data center-level network infrastructures require managing large volumes of data using high-speed protocols such as InfiniBand, as it allows low latency and parallel processing, as well as various applied switches at different network architecture levels. In this article, we examine those protocols at the data communication level that GenAI uses to optimize and guarantee data flow between nodes, as well as the design and reference of network architectures in the field of GenIA. On the other hand, the components of the GenAI networks used are analyzed. Similarly, a case study is proposed where the performance of the Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) is analyzed based on the definition of a series of metrics such as memory access, memory bandwidth, throughput, energy consumption, temperature, and clock speed, and that through the simulation of neural networks specifically using the Radial Basic Function (RBF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) algorithms, it helps to understand and analyze to what extent these metrics behave and generate possible solutions in the field of data centers.},
