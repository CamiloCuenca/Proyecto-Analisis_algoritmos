  abstract={In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), native generative AI (GenAI) has become prominent in generating intelligent cyber-attacks in a smart grid environment by imitating operational parameters and metrics. As a result, it is imperative to understand the attack generation capabilities of native GenAI models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Autoencoders in a smart grid environment. This research aims to explore the potential of GenAI models to accurately imitate and analyze the behavior of cyberattacks within a smart grid environment. The goal is to understand the risks posed by these intelligent attacks while developing strategies to protect against disruptive Distributed Energy Resources (DER) events, such as incorrect load shifting, imbalanced demand supply, and unstable price forecasting. First, this work leverages two customized native GenAI models, namely GAN and Autoencoder, to synthesize DERs control message parameters such as nominal power consumption, price elasticity coefficients, and communication data packets, among others, to introduce highly unpredictable new intelligent attack vectors. Second, this research proposes and develops a new Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) framework by creating correlation dependency nodes among DER control message parameters to understand the risks of intelligent attack vectors better while monitoring and mitigating their impact on smart grid operations. In particular, by leveraging the customized BBN, the system can observe and analyze the uncertain behaviors in DER operations that GenAI introduces, and the proposed framework can help mitigate grid vulnerabilities by understanding the poisonous parameters through mutual information. Finally, the experiment results show that the Autoencoder outperformed GAN in reproducing intelligent attacks with an MSE about 98.984% lower than that of GANs. Additionally, BBN can explain prominent parameters of the intelligent attacks’ by quantifying dependencies through mutual information.},

  abstract={This research full paper delves into university in-structors' experiences and attitudes toward AI language models, filling a gap in the literature by analyzing educators' perspectives on AI's role in the classroom and its potential impacts on teaching and learning. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and the expanding integration of large language models (LLMs) have ignited a debate about their application in education. The objective of this research is to investigate the level of awareness, overall sentiment towards adoption, and the factors influencing these attitudes for LLMs and generative AI-based tools in higher education. Data was collected through a survey using a Likert scale, which was complemented by follow-up interviews to gain a more nuanced understanding of the instructors' viewpoints. The collected data was processed using statistical and thematic analysis techniques. Our findings reveal that educators are increasingly aware of and generally positive towards these tools. We find no correlation between teaching style and attitude toward generative AI. Finally, while CS educators show far more confidence in their technical understanding of generative AI tools and more positivity towards them than educators in other fields, they show no more confidence in their ability to detect AI-generated work.},

  abstract={The next generation of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) poses a variety of important societal problems, including the possible crises and upheavals of the AI machine, which could cause fundamental changes. As the discussion around Artificial Superintelligence underscores the importance of continual dialogue between man and its ability to control technology, it also raises the problem of designing intelligent interactive and collaborative tools and systems to allow this dialogue. Historically, the term “AI” was used from 1950 to 1975, then fell out of favor during the” AI winter” from 1975 to 1995, and was narrowed to ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence). As a result, terms like “Machine Learning,” “Natural language Processing,” and “Data Science” were frequently mislabelled as AI. Today, AI has allowed clinicians to rely heavily on ML which is highly integrated with coding, billing, medical records, scheduling, contracting, medication ordering, and administrative functions. AI is now a thriving industry with massive capital investments and once again is on the verge of a great revolution. There are compelling reasons to investigate artificial super intelligence. This type of AI is capable of surpassing human intellect by expressing cognitive skills and developing its own mental capabilities. ASI is a highly sophisticated, and intelligent type of AI that goes beyond normal intellectual capacity. This paper will discuss the societal impact and the current academic impact of ASI. Finally, this study would attempt to utilize the Markov Decision Model of Machine Learning to predict the trajectory of ASI in the very near future.},

  abstract={This thesis investigates the synergies between Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Intelligent Bot Development as well as Robotic Process Automation (RPA). Goals are to explore how GANs can boost RPA systems’ functionality through crude high fidelity synthetic data capabilities, improved natural language understanding which allows bots to handle complex user conversations. At the expected outcome the aim was to develop smarter and more flexible bots who can solve a wider range of problems in more flexible environment. Incorporating GANs, this research hopes to push forward RPA systems leading to more efficient, flexible, and intelligent automation solutions. In addition, the study will show how GANs enable organizations to rapidly prototype and simulate bot performance, and when combined with AI driven processes, make it easier to deploy new approaches that both improve bot performance, and human bot interaction. In the end, this work would reveal a full understanding of how GANs can dramatically transform intelligent automation by creating context understanding interactive and scalable bot systems.},

  title={Towards next-generation federated learning: A case study on privacy attacks in artificial intelligence systems}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1446-1453},
  abstract={Accurate and trust are crucial for ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence (AI) markets. One of the challenges is data leakage, which is frequently overlooked but possesses highly consequential implications. Federated learning (FL) is recognised as a new era of secure AI systems. The market for FL is estimated to reach USD 266.77 million by 2030 according to Polaris Market Research (1). This paper focuses on FL-based approaches for improving AI safety and examines the significance of Deep learning (DL) and its privacy implications. This has been achieved through six models: Federated Convolutional Neural Network (F-CNN), Federated averaging CNN (FA-CNN), Federated Adam (FA), Malicious Generative adversarial network (MGAN), Federated M-GAN (FMGAN) and Conditional GAN (CGAN). The authors analysed MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets and conducted extensive numerical evaluations to confirm improved user privacy in federated learning for AI models. A case study with fast convergence speed and excellent asymptotic test accuracy was designed to outline White-box attacks on MGAN, FMGAN, and CGAN models. The study also implemented active inference attacks on deep neural networks without sharing raw data through FL. We created 256 synthetic images specifically to test the effectiveness of the original classifier. These counterfeit visuals effectively deceived the classifier, appearing as legitimate representations of true class labels. Trimming shared parameters was ineffective in preventing the attack, revealing limitations in collaborative learning. The generator shows the least loss of 0.0104 encountered of all models in the study. Our Generator is also the fastest after the FMGAN model. FMGAN performs best with maximum accuracy (0.9613) followed by CGAN (0.9208), MGAN (0.9163), FA (0.5148), FCNN (0.4376) and FACNN (0.4285). It also demonstrated high efficiency by successfully attacking in a short timeframe of 0.7459 milliseconds. The Federated approach led by Adam exhibited the longest processing time, at approximately 10.52 minutes. The case study illustrates the risks of surveillance and manipulation by attackers, who pressured participants to disclose confidential information. It also aimed to increase flexibility and robustness. Our work is accessible to diverse audiences, facilitating the adoption and practical applications of deep learning methods for privacy protection by major corporations.},

  abstract={Unprecedented advances in Artificial Intelligence and its widespread applications in diverse fields without a sufficient social, ethical, legal, or technological framework to oversee it have sparked concerns about its decisions having ethical and social implications. Identifying and addressing the ethical issues of artificial intelligence has been a topic of great importance to researchers, governments, law enforcement agencies, and corporations, given the growing concerns of individuals, organizations, countries, and society. However, very little progress has been made to address them. These ethical and social issues, such as privacy breaches, bias, discrimination, non-accountability, less transparency, unemployment, promoting inequality, social manipulation, loss of human relationships, and independence, inevitably impact the existing social order and raise ethical concerns. This paper provides an overview and analysis of ethical issues, strategies for dealing with them, and techniques for assessing the ethics associated with artificial intelligence. Additionally, the study underscores the increasing ethical and social ramifications arising from the expanding use of technology in various domains. It also highlights insufficient technical solutions and a fitting framework to tackle these concerns. Ultimately, the paper emphasizes the necessity for thorough research to identify suitable technological solutions to address these ethical challenges.},

  abstract={In the face of increasingly complex network environments, this study aims to improve the ability of information network security situation awareness. Through artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies based on the isolation forest (IF) algorithm, a multi-level and modular security situation awareness framework is constructed. The framework integrates deep learning, natural language processing and adaptive learning technologies to perform indepth analysis and feature extraction on multi-source data to improve the detection, identification and response capabilities of network threats. Experimental results show that the framework exhibits high detection accuracy and an average response time of less than 100 seconds in standardized tests, and effectively responds to emergencies through adaptive learning modules. Multiple simulated network attack scenarios verify the performance and reliability of the framework under different conditions. The research results establish the effectiveness of the isolation forest algorithm in information network security and show advantages in key indicators such as false alarm rate, accuracy, detection delay and true negative rate. Future research will continue to explore the integration of multi-source information to improve recognition performance in complex network environments.},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={This research-to-practice paper presents a curriculum, “AI Literacy for All,” to promote an interdisciplinary under-standing of AI, its socio-technical implications, and its practical applications for all levels of education. With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), there is a need for AI literacy that goes beyond the traditional AI education curriculum. AI literacy has been conceptualized in various ways, including public literacy, competency building for designers, conceptual understanding of AI concepts, and domain-specific upskilling. Most of these conceptualizations were established before the public release of Generative AI (Gen-AI) tools such as ChatGPT. AI education has focused on the principles and applications of AI through a technical lens that emphasizes the mastery of AI principles, the mathematical foundations underlying these technologies, and the programming and mathematical skills necessary to implement AI solutions. The non-technical component of AI literacy has often been limited to social and ethical implications, privacy and security issues, or the experience of interacting with AI. In AI Literacy for all, we emphasize a balanced curriculum that includes technical as well as non-technical learning outcomes to enable a conceptual understanding and critical evaluation of AI technologies in an interdisciplinary socio-technical context. The paper presents four pillars of AI literacy: understanding the scope and technical dimensions of AI, learning how to interact with Gen-AI in an informed and responsible way, the socio-technical issues of ethical and responsible AI, and the social and future implications of AI. While it is important to include all learning outcomes for AI education in a Computer Science major, the learning outcomes can be adjusted for other learning contexts, including, non-CS majors, high school summer camps, the adult workforce, and the public. This paper advocates for a shift in AI literacy education to offer a more interdisciplinary socio-technical approach as a pathway to broaden participation in AI. This approach not only broadens students' perspectives but also prepares them to think critically about integrating AI into their future professional and personal lives.},

In the Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain, it has also been identified that scrutinising the development context and path of AI will be able to help both academia and industry better understand the current AI limitations, reveal future AI trends, and facilitate AI/digital transformations. [Objectives]: Given the dramatic boom of modern AI, this research aims to unearth the evolution pattern along the recent three AI waves (namely predictive AI, generative AI and agentic AI), and accordingly to guide AI research and development to focus on the most promising directions. [Method]: We employed analogical reasoning as the research method and referred to the existing software architectural styles to inspire our understanding of the architectural evolution of modern AI technologies. [Results]: We see a service-oriented trend in modern AI's working mechanisms, and the offering of AI power seems to be transiting from a heavyweight and monolithic paradigm to an organisational and collaborative paradigm with more and more specific separation of concerns. Following this service-oriented evolution trend, we borrow software architecture lessons and foresee opportunities to grow the current AI wave to a further height, e.g., standardising AI agent-friendly APIs and developing serverless AI agents. [Conclusions]: What is happening in the AI domain has happened before in the software engineering domain. It is worth reusing software architecture knowledge to evolve the architecture of AI technologies.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence and cyber-physical systems (CPS) are two of the key technologies of the future that are enabling major global shifts. However, most of the current implementations of AI in CPS are not explainable, which creates serious problems in ethical, legal, regulatory, and other domains. Therefore, it is necessary for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to be integrated with cyber-physical systems to meet the vital needs for control, fairness, accountability, safety, cyber-resilience, and cybersecurity. The goal of this review is to demonstrate the need, benefits, challenges, and implementation of XAI for CPS. We review the existing literature about XAI and CPS, discuss the current state of the art, examine applications in different domains, and make recommendations for future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first peer-reviewed academic article to provide a comprehensive review of general XAI for CPS. We also contribute new research ideas including development of multisensory explanations and outputs for these systems, application of XAI to CPS to decrease occupational burnout and increase employee engagement, and enumeration of the multidisciplinary goals and benefits of XAI as applied to cyber-physical systems.},

The intermediate designers have been working in the design and related industries for over two years. The comparison is about design quality and efficiency, evaluated by 20 volunteers. Empirically we find over 50% of the paintings generated by SmartPaint are more preferred than those drawn by human designers along creativity, artistic quality and color scheme. Besides, SmartPaint takes only less than 1% of the time spended by human designers.},

  abstract={The analysis of retinal vessel imaging can diagnose and monitor various diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and so on. However, testing of retinal vessels requires professional clinicians to examine and evaluate digital colorful fundus images. This process consumes a lot of time and human labor, so automated fundus image segmentation models are necessary to provide decision-making. We propose an end-toend retinal vessel segmentation model based on a Generative Adversarial Network. First of all, a self-made amplifier was added to magnify the fundus images for generator. Next, we generated probability maps of retinal vessels. Experiments on two public fundus datasets, Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE) and Structured Analysis of the Retina (STARE), showed that our method outperforms the state-ofthe-art methods in terms of the accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.},

  title={Evaluating Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Networks Over Membership Inference Attack}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={167412-167425},
  abstract={As communication technology advances with 5G, the amount of data accumulated online is explosively increasing. From these data, valuable results are being created through data analysis technologies. Among them, artificial intelligence (AI) has shown remarkable performances in various fields and is emerging as an innovative technology. In particular, machine learning and deep learning models are evolving rapidly and are being widely deployed in practical applications. Meanwhile, behind the widespread use of these models, privacy concerns have been continuously raised. In addition, as substantial privacy invasion attacks against machine learning and deep learning models have been proposed, the importance of research on privacy-preserving AI is being emphasized. Accordingly, in the field of differential privacy, which has become a de facto standard for preserving privacy, various mechanisms have been proposed to preserve the privacy of AI models. However, it is unclear how to calibrate appropriate privacy parameters, taking into account the trade-off between a model’s utility and data privacy. Moreover, there is a lack of research that analyzes the relationship between the degree of differential privacy guarantee and privacy invasion attacks. In this paper, we investigate the resistance of differentially private AI models to substantial privacy invasion attacks according to the degree of privacy guarantee, and analyze how privacy parameters should be set to prevent the attacks while preserving the utility of the models. Specifically, we focus on generative adversarial networks (GAN), which is one of the most sophisticated AI models, and on the membership inference attack, which is the most fundamental privacy invasion attack. In the experimental evaluation, by quantifying the effectiveness of the attack based on the degree of privacy guarantee, we show that differential privacy can simultaneously preserve data privacy and the utility of models with moderate privacy budgets.},

  title={An ECG Signal Denoising Method Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Net}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={26},
  number={7},
  pages={2929-2940},
  abstract={In this paper, a novel denoising method for electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is proposed to improve performance and availability under multiple noise cases. The method is based on the framework of conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN), and we improved the CGAN framework for ECG denoising. The proposed framework consists of two networks: a generator that is composed of the optimized convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) and a discriminator that is composed of four convolution layers and one full connection layer. As the convolutional layers of CAE can preserve spatial locality and the neighborhood relations in the latent higher-level feature representations of ECG signal, and the skip connection facilitates the gradient propagation in the denoising training process, the trained denoising model has good performance and generalization ability. The extensive experimental results on MIT-BIH databases show that for single noise and mixed noises, the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of denoised ECG signal is above 39 dB, and it is better than that of the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the denoised classification results of four cardiac diseases show that the average accuracy increased above 32$\%$ under multiple noises under SNR=0 dB. So, the proposed method can remove noise effectively as well as keep the details of the features of ECG signals.},

  abstract={Time series forecasting has widespread applications in everyday life, e.g. in the domains of weather forecasting, transportation planning, and electricity demand prediction. Due to the high dimensions, uncertainties, and changes of data in time series, accurately predicting future trends of time series remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a new time series forecasting model, the Generative Adversarial Network Model with Attention Mechanism (GANAM), which uses a global residual network to enhance the attention mechanism module and acts as a generator to learn the deep temporal features and then uses the discriminator of the generative adversarial network for improving the forecasting capability. In addition, the classical time series model can lead to an accumulation of errors in the multi-step prediction process. The proposed model also can effectively reduce this problem by utilizing the generative adversarial network with an attention mechanism. The experiments on various real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model.},

However, the integration of GenAl in education raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding privacy, bias, and the accuracy of AI-generated content, as well as the authenticity and authorship of the work. There is a strong emphasis on the need for robust guidelines and human oversight to mitigate these issues. We used GenAl to create an NPC with a unique personality and life background and enable learners to interact with the NPC without scripted dialogue, creating an engaging game-based learning environment to evaluate the perceptions of the students using GenAl as a learning tool.

  abstract={In this study, we introduce LSN-GAN, a new algorithm designed to improve Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by implementing Least Square Gradient Normalization. This technique adjusts gradients in the GAN's discriminator, making training more stable by avoiding common issues like gradient blow-up or disappearance. Our goal is to make GANs more reliable and enhance the quality of generated images. We tested LSN-GAN against existing models using the CIFAR-10 and LSUN Church Outdoor datasets. Our method was evaluated based on the Inception Score, which measures image quality and diversity, and the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), which assesses the similarity between generated and real images. LSN-GAN showed improved results, achieving higher Inception Scores and lower FID values compared to models like SN-GAN and GN-GAN, indicating better image generation capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that LSN-GAN not only proposes a novel approach to handling gradients in GANs but also significantly enhances the output image quality. This makes LSN-GAN a promising tool for advancing the field of generative models and their applications in image generation.},

  abstract={Wheat yield prediction is key to food security and optimal resource use. In this paper, Generative AI is use for specifically GANs and VAEs, to predict wheat yield under different weather conditions, uses the crop yield prediction dataset from Kaggle which has temperature, rainfall and soil quality as parameters and build models that beat traditional statistical methods. By leveraging advanced AI models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), the model generates synthetic data that mimics these rare occurrences. The GAN generates synthetic data that enriches the training set and improves prediction accuracy. The VAE captures the complex non-linear relationships between input features and output. The combination of both models gives us a robust framework for yield prediction. Experimental results shows that the GAN dataset gives 14% improvement over baseline models. VAE model gives 13% improvement on its own, showing its ability to handle the variability and complexity of agricultural data. This dual model approach is a big leap in agricultural analytics and will enable more robust and adaptive farming in the face of climate change.},

  pages={470-474},
  abstract={Many studies have demonstrated that generative AI (GenAI) feedback has potential in language learning; however, few studies explore how learners' self-efficacy shapes their metacognitive and behavioural engagement with GenAI feedback. This study investigates differences in metacognitive strategy networks and behavioural sequences between high and low self-efficacy learners interacting with GenAI feedback in reading comprehension tasks. By integrating epistemic network analysis (ENA), sequential analysis, and retrospective interviews, this study analysed the interactions of 16 junior secondary students with five types of GenAI feedback. The results revealed that high self-efficacy learners develop metacognitive networks centred on evaluating and dynamically cycling between feedback types to inform future learning. In contrast, low self-efficacy learners displayed a metacognitive strategy network dominated by planning and linear behavioural sequences that prioritise immediate task completion. The findings advocate for self-efficacy-driven GenAI feedback systems that dynamically tailor metacognitive scaffolding to catalyse personalised self-regulated learning.},

  abstract={SAR images possess unique attributes that present challenges for both human observers and vision AI models to interpret, owing to their electromagnetic characteristics. The interpretation of SAR images encounters various hurdles, with one of the primary obstacles being the data itself, which includes issues related to both the quantity and quality of the data. The challenges can be addressed using generative AI technologies. Generative AI, often known as GenAI, is a very advanced and powerful technology in the field of artificial intelligence that has gained significant attention. The advancement has created possibilities for the creation of texts, photorealistic pictures, videos, and material in various modalities. This paper aims to comprehensively investigate the intersection of GenAI and SAR. First, we illustrate the common data generation-based applications in SAR field and compare them with computer vision tasks, analyzing the similarity, difference, and general challenges of them. Then, an overview of the latest GenAI models is systematically reviewed, including various basic models and their variations targeting the general challenges. Additionally, the corresponding applications in SAR domain are also included. Specifically, we propose to summarize the physical model based simulation approaches for SAR, and analyze the hybrid modeling methods that combine the GenAI and interpretable models. The evaluation methods that have been or could be applied to SAR, are also explored. Finally, the potential challenges and future prospects are discussed. To our best knowledge, this survey is the first exhaustive examination of the interdiscipline of SAR and GenAI, encompassing a wide range of topics, including deep neural networks, physical models, computer vision, and SAR images.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence has garnered significant interest in higher education, with growing concerns about its consequences for teaching, learning, and assessment. Educators are now faced with the task of adopting genAI into curricula in ways that are responsive to both the short- and long-term effects of this technological disruption on learning. This study considers these effects, focusing on the impacts of genAI on the intrinsic value of learning and its influences on shaping transformative encounters with knowledge in STEM curricula. The implications of incorporating genAI into outcomes and assessment tasks are examined using a constructivist approach based on taxonomies of cognitive skills involved in learning and STEM competency development namely, Bloom's and SOLO taxonomies, and Luckett's knowledge planes. The study offers insights into how the incorporation of genAI may influence conceptual knowledge building and the development of certain STEM graduate attributes and makes recommendations for teachers of STEM curricula.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence and digital twin technology show the excellent ability in the fault prognostic and health management of machinery equipment. However, interaction between the data driven and physical informed is a challenge for modeling the digital twin framework. In response to this limitation, a fault mechanism assisted intelligent fault diagnosis method based on improved generative adversarial network for digital twin two-stage gearbox is proposed. Firstly, the twenty-six degree-of-freedom dynamic model is established to realize the virtual entity of two-stage gearbox. The initial parameters of dynamic model are determined by the prior knowledge based on the fault mechanism of gear. Then, the improved generative adversarial network is designed to achieve the interaction of virtual entity and physical entity. The measured signal from the physical entity is used to train the proposed model for minimizing the difference of simulation signal from the dynamic model. The loss of proposed model is introduced by combining the physics knowledge of gear dynamic mechanism and observations from the sensor. Finally, the proposed method is applied to simulate the vibration signal of gear fault under different conditions that is consistent with the measured signal, which can be applied for the fault diagnosis of gear. The two-stage gearbox fault experiments with missing sample are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract={Summary <p>GenAI is ushering in a transformative era in healthcare, with far&#x2010;reaching implications for patient care, diagnostics, and more. There's a lot happening in this field, so this chapter touches on key developments only, with a particular focus on: personalized advice for patients; detection of diseases; personalized treatment; and operational improvement. GenAI can help to reduce the administrative burden in healthcare by automating tasks such as medical coding, billing, routine enquiries, and notetaking. GenAI tools can empower individuals to take charge of their own healthcare, by engaging in discussions with healthcare chatbots about potential diagnoses and treatment options, and seeking medical help when needed. When a GenAI tool generates inaccurate or &#x201c;hallucinated&#x201d; content in a sector like marketing, it's probably rather embarrassing for the company using that content. GenAI can help to solve some of the biggest challenges facing global healthcare systems and make healthcare much more accessible and efficient.</p>},

  abstract={A major study topic, particularly in machine learning and artificial intelligence, has resulted from the prediction of traffic congestion in recent years (AI). During the last few decade, this study field has greatly increased due to the emergence of huge data from stationary sensor or probe vehicle data. Congestion forecasting requires analysing a wide range of traffic variables, especially for short-term planning. Predictions of future traffic congestion are based mostly on analyses of past patterns. Using traffic data like taxi trip records, urban traffic statistics, and junction counts, we propose a new method for calculating traffic flows. The suggested method makes use of CGAN and GCN, and we enhanced Unet to realise a key component of the generator. The interaction between junctions with surveillance and intersections without monitoring is then captured using floating taxis that are spread out over the whole city. The CGAN architecture may modify the weights and improve the inference capability to provide an accurate traffic status under the present circumstances. The results of the experiment demonstrate that our technique is more accurate at estimating traffic volume than other methods.},

  abstract={The evaluation of intelligence levels is crucial in assessing the capabilities of unmanned clusters. Currently, this process is often determined subjectively, leading to potential biases and missing evaluation indicators due to limited simulation experiments. To address these issues, this paper introduces an objective method for determining intelligence levels using the ELO rating algorithm and constructs an intelligence level evaluation model based on the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to account for missing evaluation indicators. The model takes evaluation indicators as input and ELO scores as output, providing an objective reflection of the intelligence capabilities of unmanned clusters. Using an airground collaborative encirclement task as an example, the model is trained to evaluate the intelligence levels of unmanned clusters objectively. Simulation results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in quantifying intelligence levels objectively and its applicability to a wide range of unmanned clusters.},

  abstract={The recent development of generative art, a typical category of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC), is essentially beneficial for social good, which can help amateurs to create artwork and improve experts’ efficiency. However, some artists are opposed to generative art technologies due to the copyright infringement and influence of the artists’ way of earning a living, which makes the artists protest against generative art technologies, causing a lose–lose situation. Adversarial attacks against generative model training are potential solutions to address this issue, while the lose–lose situation cannot be improved. To build a win–win situation, a feasible method is to incentivize the artists to actively contribute their artworks to generative model training without influencing their living or infringing copyright, such as data crowdsourcing, but traditional data crowdsourcing methods cannot well fit the generative art area. Therefore, this article builds a blockchain-based trading system for generative model training data collection and generated artwork circulation. Specifically, this article formulates a social welfare maximization problem based on the reverse auction and designs a corresponding incentive mechanism. The conducted theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed incentive mechanism toward a win–win situation for generative art model trainers and artists.},

  abstract={AIced Prep is an AI-driven system designed to provide individuals with realistic mock interviews and personalized feedback, particularly targeting freshers, job seekers, students, and recruitment agencies. The system aims to build confidence, improve performance, and enhance candidates' chances of success in interviews. To achieve this, the project integrates a Question Generation System using RetrievalAugmented Generation(RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating relevant, unique, and non-repetitive questions. The project fo- cuses on two primary use cases: interview question generation and resume classification and mock interview. By leveraging the Mistral-7B LLM for contextually accurate question generation and FAISS for efficient vector-based retrieval, the system dynami- cally processes documents, including PDFs, to generate questions. The web-based interface, built using FastAPI and Streamlit, ensures users have an interactive and accessible experience. This hybrid approach addresses common challenges in question generation, such as repetitive questions and irrelevant content, by combining information retrieval techniques with generative AI methods. The ultimate goal of AIced Prep is to make quality interview preparation accessible to everyone, providing scalable, efficient, and personalized interview preparation solution.},

  abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered a progressive neurogenerative disorder that highly impacts elder people. Gradually this disease results in memory loss, poor thinking capacity, and overall cognitive decline. Nevertheless, various traditional works recommend that the pathological variations present in the brain happen decades prior to the initial clinical signs appearing. The implementation of cost-effective and noninvasive approaches to identify AD is significant for its timely mitigation as well as prevention. Therefore, in this article, an advanced generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided AD detection approach is designed using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which are helpful for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression very effectively. The EEG signals required for the identification of AD are collected from benchmark sources and are applied as the input to the ShortTerm Fourier Transform (STFT) for spectrogram image conversion. The AD detection is done using the proposed Attention-based Generative Adversarial Network (A-GAN), which produces the most desirable detection outcomes by classifying the input STFT images. The classification results are compared with the baseline AD detection approaches to validate the performance of the designed technique using various measures. The developed model supports earlier detection and provides highly more effective treatment interventions.},

  abstract={Summary <p>The automated detection and tracking of objects in motion from visual data like images and videos is a classic problem in computer vision that has gained renewed interest and seen great progress with modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. In particular, deep neural networks have shown unmatched capabilities for visual recognition tasks like classifying, localizing and segmenting objects of interest in complex scenes. A key advancement that has enabled the success of these techniques is the development of convolutional neural network (CNN) for moving object detection (MOD). Various architectures based on CNN can identify multiple objects in an image and draw bounding boxes around them. These networks can be trained on large annotated datasets to learn rich visual features automatically, eliminating the need for hand&#x2010;coded feature extraction. Pre&#x2010;trained networks can also be fine&#x2010;tuned for specific use cases involving detection of relevant objects like cars, humans and animals. This object detection capability provides the foundation for tracking objects across multiple frames in a video. AI, ML, and deep learning (DL) consistently outperform classical computer vision techniques for tasks like simultaneous object detection, semantic segmentation, anomaly detection in videos and predicting object trajectories over time. With innovations in neural network architectures, unsupervised and semi&#x2010;supervised learning, and leveraging motion and scene understanding beyond just appearances, the performance on these tasks continues to improve. These techniques provide unmatched capabilities compared to traditional hand&#x2010;coded approaches. With rapid progress in AI, ML and DL, automated and robust motion intelligence has applicability across domains like autonomous vehicles, surveillance, human&#x2010;computer interaction, augmented reality, robotics, and more. These make the future promising for automated motion intelligence using AI, ML and DL. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the state&#x2010;of&#x2010;the&#x2010;art techniques and algorithms that leverage traditional, AI, ML and DL for moving object detection (MOD).</p>},

  abstract={The evolution of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) constitutes a turning point in reshaping the future of technology in different aspects. Wireless networks, in particular, with the blooming of self-evolving networks, represent a rich field for exploiting GenAI and reaping several benefits that can fundamentally change the way wireless networks are designed and operated nowadays. To be specific, large GenAI models are envisioned to open up a new era of autonomous wireless networks, in which multi-modal GenAI models trained over various Telecom data, can be fine-tuned to perform several downstream tasks, eliminating the need for building and training dedicated AI models for each specific task, and paving the way for the realization of artificial general intelligence (AGI)-empowered wireless networks. In this article, we aim to unfold the opportunities that can be reaped from integrating large GenAI models into the Telecom domain. In particular, we first highlight the applications of large GenAI models in future wireless networks, defining potential use-cases and revealing insights on the associated theoretical and practical challenges.

  abstract={Millimeter-wave and Terahertz communications consist of complex analog and mixed-signal transceivers where overall system performance is often limited by the weakest performing subsystem. While analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits have significantly advanced, the future of 5G and 6G transceiver design could be accelerated by including artificial intelligence. In this combination, analog integrated circuit design and operation would harness machine learning to identify, characterize, and act upon variations and anomalies in system performance. Focusing on 5G and 6G, this paper investigates solutions for a unified intelligent integrated transceiver: a conceptual combination of a traditional analog subsystem, a supporting digital subsystem that enables artificial intelligence, and dedicated feedback circuitry or sensors that monitor performance, efficiency, or reliability. Active and passive components and propagation channels are reviewed based on their merits of introducing intelligence. Holistically and for broader applicability, the paper conceptualizes and coins the notion of an “intelligent integrated system (IIS)”, which brings forward a novel unified vision and approach toward context-aware subsystems that dynamically interact with ambient and varying operating conditions. To demonstrate viability, the paper concatenates a select set of measurement results.},

  abstract={The increase in the of online social media networks has increased the frequency of cyberbullying incidents. Cyberbullying is referred to as the aggressive, continuous and intentional use of abusive language and display of hateful behaviour with the intention to harm the individual and his reputation online. The instances of suicides and cases of mental illnesses especially among the youth are on a rise. There are numerous ways in which cyberbullying can affect a person’s life including effecting him mentally and physically. However, the detection techniques for effective cyberbullying detection are limited. The use of techniques like machine Learning, Deep Learning and Generative AI have come to the rescue. Hence, this study discusses the definition, evolution and types of Generative AI. It further discusses the types of cyberbullying. This paper also brings forward the detection techniques for efficient cyberbullying detection which includes both conventional and generative AI based techniques like large language model-based solutions. This paper further explores the future research directions in cyberbullying detection. Hence, this study paves way for efficient detection of cyberbullying thereby leveraging technological solutions for a safer online environment.},

  year={2021},

  pages={35-46},
  abstract={Trapdoor is a key component of public key cryptography design which is the essential security foundation of modern cryptography. Normally, the traditional way in designing a trapdoor is to identify a computationally hard problem, such as the NPC problems. So the trapdoor in a public key encryption mechanism turns out to be a type of limited resource. In this paper, we generalize the methodology of adversarial learning model in artificial intelligence and introduce a novel way to conveniently obtain sub-optimal and computationally hard trapdoors based on the automatic information theoretic search technique. The basic routine is constructing a generative architecture to search and discover a probabilistic reversible generator which can correctly encoding and decoding any input messages. The architecture includes a trapdoor generator built on a variational autoencoder (VAE) responsible for searching the appropriate trapdoors satisfying a maximum of entropy, a random message generator yielding random noise, and a dynamic classifier taking the results of the two generator. The evaluation of our construction shows the architecture satisfying basic indistinguishability of outputs under chosen-plaintext attack model (CPA) and high efficiency in generating cheap trapdoors.},

  abstract={Topology optimization of heatsink design is a prominent topic in power electronics today. To simplify the design process, this paper compares the accuracy of four different Artificial Intelligence (AI) models—Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Transfer Learning (TL), and Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGaNet)—in predicting heatsink temperatures and testing their extrapolation abilities. Initially, a cylindrical pin heatsink 3D model was built, and two datasets were collected from Ansys Icepak, considering five parameters. The models were trained using the first dataset, which included power ranges below 12.5W. Subsequently, the second dataset, with power ranges above 12.5W, was used to test the pre-trained models’ extrapolation abilities. The final results indicate that transfer learning, with the first three layers frozen, achieved the highest accuracy when compared to the other models using a limited new domain dataset. However, it is found that CGaNet shows good extrapolation performance when a new domain dataset is not available.},

  abstract={Summary <p>A revolutionary era in healthcare has begun with the merging of artificial intelligence (AI) with sensor technology, which has completely changed how patient care, diagnosis, and treatment approaches are provided. This abstract explores the transformative potential of AI&#x2010;powered sensors in a range of healthcare disciplines. Healthcare data analysis, disease identification, and treatment planning have all been transformed by AI and machine learning (ML) algorithms. AI&#x2010;driven literature mining approaches, in particular, have made it possible to process large biomedical text databases quickly and efficiently, revealing priceless insights into intricate biological relationships and disease causes. ML's ability to detect concepts in medical literature is demonstrated by the neural concept recognizer, a neural dictionary model that uses convolutional neural networks. It outperforms conventional rule&#x2010;based approaches and shows how knowledge can be applied to a variety of terminologies. These developments highlight how AI&#x2010;powered tools have the potential to transform healthcare decision&#x2010;making processes and speed up research by offering quick and thorough insights. To fully reap the rewards of AI&#x2010;powered sensors in healthcare, a number of obstacles must be overcome. Maintaining current ontologies, integrating various data sources with ease, guaranteeing algorithm transparency, reducing biases in training datasets, and protecting patient privacy are a few of these. AI&#x2010;powered sensors have the potential to transform healthcare delivery completely and advance medical research, but to reach their full potential and improve patient outcomes and the healthcare ecosystem as a whole significant efforts must be made to overcome current obstacles.</p>},

As edge robots become increasingly integrated into daily life and critical infrastructure, the complexity and connectivity of these systems introduce formidable challenges in ensuring security, resilience, and safety. GenAI advances from mere data interpretation to autonomously generating new data, proving critical in complex, context-aware environments like edge robotics. Our survey delves into the impact of GenAI technologies—including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Transformer-based models, and Large Language Models (LLMs)—on cybersecurity, decision-making, and the development of resilient architectures. We categorize existing research to highlight how these technologies address operational challenges and innovate predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and adaptive threat response.

  number={},
  pages={66-70},
  abstract={Shared parking optimizes available parking spaces by allowing private owners like in residential areas such as condominiums, hotels, apartments and private garage, to rent out their parking spots during times when they are unoccupied1. The concept of shared parking allows drivers – residents and visitors - avoid the long search for an unoccupied parking space while also allowing the space owners to earn passive income by renting out their owned spots during times when they’re not using them. This allows them to monetize an underutilized asset and promotes sharing economy strategy. Especially in big cities like in Metro Manila, motorists spent 24 minutes every day searching for parking on average2, where 37% of the cars in congested traffic were cruising for parking for an average of 20 minutes. This shared parking platform aims to mitigate the challenge of long search for an unoccupied residential parking space, limited parking facilities, and time-consuming property approval and payment process, providing drivers with more accessible and affordable options while reducing the daily time spent searching for parking. This platform will enable residential parking owners to rent out their parking spaces to residents/drivers who are in need of a convenient and well-priced parking space for a couple of hours, days or longer period. This case study aims to explore the development and implementation of this platform – both web and mobile – that leverages Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and user-centric design to revolutionize the parking experience, fostering a more sustainable and streamlined approach to sharing economy. The business model focuses on a commission-based revenue approach, ensuring revenue potential and scalability.},

  abstract={Recent deep generative models (DGMs) such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have shown their impressive ability in generating high-fidelity photorealistic images. Although looking appealing to human eyes, training a model on purely synthetic images for downstream image processing tasks like image classification often results in an undesired performance drop compared to training on real data. Previous works have demonstrated that enhancing a real dataset with synthetic images from DGMs can be beneficial. However, the improvements were subjected to certain circumstances and yet were not comparable to adding the same number of real images. In this work, we propose a new taxonomy to describe factors contributing to this commonly observed phenomenon and investigate it on the popular CIFAR-10 dataset. We hypothesize that the Content Gap accounts for a large portion of the performance drop when using synthetic images from DGM and propose strategies to better utilize them in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets showcase that our method outperforms baselines on downstream classification tasks both in case of training on synthetic only (Synthetic-to-Real) and training on a mix of real and synthetic data (Data Augmentation), particularly in the data-scarce scenario.},

  abstract={Personalized learning has significantly enhanced teaching practice through its development to cater to varied learning needs and in its full utilization of learner engagement. Traditional practice, in contrast, is limited by fixed content, minimum learner flexibility, and minimal immediate feedback. Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) introduces a revolution through self-generated adaptive learning material such as customized tests, interactive simulations, and adaptive lesson plans. This article presents a systematic review on the use of Generative AI in education, synthesizing what has been published on its contributions to learning achievement based on empirical studies. Studies conducted by AI-powered platforms like Khan Academy's AI tutor and Duolingo's adaptive questions indicate a 26-38% boost in student engagement, a 34% boost in learning retention, and a 40% decrease in teacher workloads. Additionally, current evidence shows that adaptive learning models implemented using AI cut dropout rates by 22% and improved evaluation accuracy through live automated feedback. Despite these advantages, data confidentiality, algorithm bias, and material reliability concerns continue to exist. This paper fills this gap through the discussion of ethical AI platforms, the usage of open-sourced datasets in minimizing bias, and Explainable AI (XAI) as a means for transparency. Moreover, it explores hybrid AI-human models of education, scalability of AI-powered education in developing regions, and policy recommendations for affordable education. By integrating existing research, this paper also contributes to the body of knowledge on AI-facilitated personalized learning and its implications for learning in the future.},

As the industry increasingly seeks to hire candidates with technical ability and the required skill set to solve real-world problems, traditional education and recruitment approaches struggle to keep up with the requirements. This misalignment is particularly evident in computer science and engineering, which is prone to rapid transformations, thus demanding an equally dynamic ecosystem. Generative AI (Gen AI), a subset of Artificial Intelligence, shows great promise in bridging the gaps between the three stakeholders: students, universities, and industry. We have leveraged Generative AI to attain the university curricula, align the student skills with the industry, and reshape the hiring and education process, which results in a well-collaborated ecosystem where students, universities, and industry are better aligned to serve each other’s interests.},

  abstract={Fundamental frequency (F0) contours play a very important role in reflecting the emotion, identity, intension, and attitude of a speaker in samples of speech. In this paper, we adopted a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate artificial F0 contours of emotional speech. The GAN faces some limitations, however, in that it frequently generates undesired data because of unstable training, and it can repeatedly generate very similar or the same data, which is known as mode collapse. This study constructed a GAN-based generative model for F0 contours that can stably generate more-various F0 contours that fit the statistical characteristics of the training data. We tested the classification rate of four kinds of emotions in the F0 contours generated from five kinds of generative models. We also evaluated the averaged local density of the generated F0 contours to represent the variety of the generated F0 contours. Preliminary experiments confirmed the validity and effectiveness of the proposed generative model.},

  abstract={The increased demand for agricultural land and the more frequent occurrence of extreme weather conditions lead to increased greenhouses usage in agriculture. Greenhouses offer an efficient alternative to traditional agriculture as all environmental parameters are controlled, leading to a higher yield per land use. In older greenhouses, the different environmental factors are set manually, resulting in unfavorable climate conditions due to over- and undershoots of the factors. Optimizing environmental conditions, closed-loop control systems (CLCS) are used to reduce the susceptibility to over- and undershoots as well as to disturbance variables. The greenhouse actuators respond to various input values bringing changes to the environmental parameters. For controlling the actuators, artificial intelligence (AI) offers the potential to control the environmental parameters more accurately than a simple CLCS. With the help of predicting the influence of actuators regarding the greenhouse climate, AI-based climate systems might outperform CLCS systems and human experts. This paper provides an overview of the different architectures in which AI is used for controlling complex systems and discusses its potential for greenhouses. The results will show that AI offers the possibility for yield increase and resources saving.},

  pages={876-886},
  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) is quickly becoming an integral part of everyday life. AI is no longer limited to advanced applications; it is embedded in applications and tools we use daily to streamline tasks and solve problems. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, are designed to help users make decisions, produce recommendations, and provide more personalized solutions to user inquiries. The immense reach these systems have had in such a short period has significantly impacted education, work, and interpersonal interactions. AI systems are only becoming more common, and it is imperative that developers work to address bias within them to promote fair use for all, not only the neurotypical. Research investigating the bias harbored by LLM platforms is particularly limited when it comes to addressing bias against individuals with autism. We applied inductive thematic analysis, followed by deductive thematic analysis, to analyze 34 scientific research papers gathered from two major academic databases: ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore. This method helped us learn more about the current empirical understanding of LLM bias as it relates to the context of autism. We found that bias within LLMs has the potential to harm individuals with autism who are looking for answers to problems for which LLMs have been postulated as a solution. LLMs also have the potential to reinforce negative stereotypes, leading users with autism who already face bias in daily life to continually struggle when faced with this new technological frontier.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that results in cognitive decline, and even dementia, in patients. To diagnose AD, a combination of tools is typically used, with structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) being one of them. sMRI images have mostly been used in supervised deep learning approaches, which requires large amounts of labeled data. To alleviate the need for labels, unsupervised deep learning could be used as an alternative. This study proposes an unsupervised model based on the deep convolutional generative adversarial network that performs anomaly detection on brain MRIs to diagnose AD. The model is able to yield an AUROC of 0.7951, a precision of 0.8228, a recall of 0.7386, and an accuracy of 74.44%.},

  abstract={Generative adversarial network (GAN) has been extensively applied in many fields since it was first proposed in 2014. There have been ongoing attempts at improving the model and developing its extensions. The basic idea behind GAN stems from the two-player zero-sum game. Composed of a generator and a discriminator, GAN is trained through a “battle” between the two networks, where the generator tries to fool the discriminator. In contrast, the discriminator tries not to be deceived. The purpose is to estimate the potential distribution of data samples and generate new data samples. GAN is currently being studied in computer vision, language processing, and information security and is still far from reaching its potential. Since there are limited existing resources on GAN reviews, this paper provides a comprehensive review of a few of the most important GAN variants. We divided the variants into three categories: foundation, extension, and advanced, gave an overview of each architecture, and analyzed their advantages and disadvantages. We also summarized some of the most popular applications of GAN, and finally, we brought up the problems of GAN-based architectures that have yet to be solved and pointed out the future direction of GAN research and development.},

  abstract={As the interaction of light with the Earth surface is very complex, spectral pixels are composed of sophisticated mixtures of distinct substances. The parameters of the estimated models are difficult to set. In this paper, we first propose a spatial-spectral conditional generative adversarial networks (scGANs) method to solve this problem, based on the following assumptions: the unmixing process from pixels to abundance can be viewed as a transformation of two modalities with an intrinsic specific relationship. The method learns the manifold structure of the hyperspectral data using an adversarial strategy, inputting pixels blocks with spatial information to generate the abundance of the central pixels. Then, we proposed superpixel segmentation and random splitting method to synthesize data with spatial structure. Finally, the proposed scGANs method is evaluated using synthetic data and real hyperspectral data, and compared to several state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method outperforms all the comparison methods in the experiments.},

  abstract={As industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS) play an increasingly pivotal role in the new industrial paradigm, their sustainability has become the current research focus. Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction, also known as prognostics, is critically significant for the sustainability of ICPS. The prognostics involve utilizing process monitoring devices within ICPS to acquire real-time operational data. Based on the trends observed in the monitored data, the analysis predicts when potential system failures may occur. Accurate prognostics allow real-time monitoring of the system's health status, which enables early warning of possible faults and system reliability. The primary objective of this paper is to provide readers with a timely survey and review that reveals the current research status, development trends, and common challenges in the prognostics domain within ICPS. From the perspective of artificial intelligence (AI), the paper comprehensively reviews predictive approaches based on stochastic process, machine learning, and their hybrid applications. Through a comprehensive comparison of existing approaches, the paper delves into the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches. Furthermore, facing some cutting-edge issues in existing RUL prediction approaches for ICPS, this paper analyzes some pioneering investigations that have achieved great results. Finally, the paper explores the opportunities and challenges of prognostics from the perspective of artificial intelligence, which aims to drive the sustainability of ICPS.},

  abstract={Introducing a data-driven Self-Awareness (SA) module in Cognitive Radio (CR) can support the system to establish secure networks against various attacks from malicious users. Such users can manipulate the radio spectrum in order to make the CR learn wrong behaviours and take mistaken actions. A basic SA module includes the ability to learn generative models and detect abnormalities inside the radio spectrum. In this work, we propose and implement Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Abnormality Detection techniques at the physical (PHY)-layer in CR enabled by learning Generative Models. Specifically, two real-world practical applications related to different data dimensionality and sampling rates are presented. The first application implements the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (C-GAN) investigated on generalized state vectors extracted from spectrum representation samples to study the dynamic behaviour of the wideband signal. While the second application is based on learning a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model from a generalized state vector which contains sub-bands information extracted from the radio spectrum. Results show that both of the proposed methods are capable of detecting abnormal signals in the spectrum and pave the road towards Self-Aware radio.},

  abstract={Cancer is an overarching term encompassing over number of distinct diseases characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells. These diseases occur when abnormal cells proliferate uncontrollably, exceeding their usual boundaries to invade adjacent body structures and potentially disseminate to distant organs. It stands as a noteworthy global health concern, prompting ongoing research aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of its root causes, devising more effective treatments and refining early detection methods. Advancements in fields like genomics, immunology and artificial intelligence are contributing to our comprehension of cancer and the creation of innovative approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Early detection and improvements in cancer therapy have intensified survival rates for many cancer types, yet it continues to position a substantial health challenge worldwide. Deep learning has emerged as an effective tool in the cancer diagnosis, promising enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and speed in various aspects of cancer assessment. Artificial intelligence algorithms that use the deep learning method are effective at analyzing medical imaging like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), X-radiation images, Computerized Tomography (CT) scans, and to identify and classify malignant anomalies. Moreover, deep learning can be connected to extract quantitative features from medical images, a discipline known as radiomics, which yields valuable insights for characterizing tumors and forecasting their prognosis. Extending the possibility, innovative technologies like Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) assumes a pivotal role in the domain of cancer diagnosis by producing synthetic data, images, or simulations that lend invaluable support to various features of cancer detection and analysis. These technologies find application across the spectrum of cancer related tasks, spanning detection, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment optimization, drug discovery and patient care. This research study discovers the character of Generative Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms in cancer prediction, covering their current applications, limitations, and future prospects.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Anomaly detection in network traffic is a critical aspect of cybersecurity, aiming to identify abnormal behaviors indicative of potential security threats. In recent years, advancements in AI techniques have led to the exploration of innovative approaches for enhancing anomaly detection capabilities. This study introduces a novel methodology leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for anomaly detection in network traffic data, contributing to the advancement of AI cybersecurity. The proposed approach integrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature selection, allowing for the extraction of essential network traffic patterns while reducing dimensionality. Subsequently, GANs are employed to learn the underlying distribution of normal network traffic and generate synthetic samples for anomaly detection. This framework offers a holistic solution that combines the strengths of feature selection and generative modeling to effectively discern anomalous activities from normal network behaviors. The methodology is evaluated using a comprehensive dataset collected from Kaggle, comprising diverse network traffic records. Results demonstrate the superior performance of the PCA-GAN method compared to existing techniques, achieving high accuracy and robust detection of anomalies in network traffic. The integration of PCA for dimensionality reduction and GANs for generative modeling proves to be effective in enhancing cybersecurity measures, providing a promising solution for detecting and mitigating security threats in network infrastructures. With an accuracy of around 99.12%, the suggested method which uses Python software outperforms other existing techniques like CNN-GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-LSTM, and Conv-LSTM by 1.49%. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts in leveraging AI technologies for bolstering cybersecurity defenses and safeguarding critical systems against malicious activities.},

There is increasing evidence that generative AI techniques such as ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot can increase the productivity of writing or coding tasks respectively. In our case, both prototyping and teaching serious games are complex because of the number and diversity of tasks involved and we are currently investigating whether AI techniques can be used to improve and simplify the process. For example, ChatGPT could support the process of creating the game narrative, and other systems such as Stable Diffusion could ease the creation of some of the graphics resources (e.g., for creating more cohesive and coherent backgrounds). Automating some of the costlier processes of game prototyping can contribute to creating better products by allowing the playtesting of different options for more effective games. As the field of generative AI is in continuous change, this paper presents a working methodology to simplify the development of serious games, that has been instantiated with concrete tools. This working methodology has been piloted effectively by one student from a Master of Design for the development of a serious game and will be tested in a serious games development course. In the article we also explore how these AI techniques can be combined with a game authoring environment such as uAdventure to systematize the development of serious games. The use of Generative AI offers great potential for improving the development of serious games and needs to be further researched alongside its applications for game-based learning education.},

  abstract={This study explores the integration of AI-powered 2D-to-3D generation tools in architectural design workflows, focusing on open-source ComfyUI and its 3D pack extension. A mixed-methods approach combining workflow demonstrations with architecture students and quantitative survey analysis reveals both potential applications and pedagogical implications. While not yet practical for professional use, AIgenerated 3D models serve as valuable educational tools for conceptual design, facilitating spatial visualization and design exploration. Survey results ($\mathrm{N}=126$) revealed strong student support for AI integration in architectural education, driven more by its future potential than current capabilities. This forward-looking perspective and ability to separate educational benefits from job security concerns indicate students’ preparedness for an AI-influenced profession. This study demonstrates how AI-driven 3D generation tools can be effectively integrated into architectural design workflows and education, balancing technological innovation with pedagogical needs.},

  abstract={The widespread use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools in higher education, particularly among university students, has raised ethical concerns regarding unintentional plagiarism. Although these tools offer benefits such as time-saving and improved quality, with over 100 available applications, they may inadvertently include borrowed content, posing challenges to academic integrity. Ethical concerns arise within educational institutions, faculty, and integrity committees, complicating evaluations of originality. To address these concerns, universities must establish clear guidelines and educational programs for responsible use of GenAI applications. Educators need to remain current with the latest AI technologies, become proficient in their use, and utilize advanced techniques to teach students how to use them appropriately. This mixed-methods study examines undergraduate engineering students' understanding of GenAI, its usage and ethical implications. The findings demonstrate that ChatGPT is the most popular GenAI application among the students, but also highlight the professors' unfavorable attitudes towards GenAI. The study endeavors to improve understanding of perspectives on GenAI in higher education, facilitating responsible technology integration in classrooms and fostering students' ethical growth. The investigation provides valuable insights for professors, institutions, and research communities engaged in student development and educational advancement. This study also shows a panorama of strategies that could be implemented by teachers to incorporate GenAI in higher education.},

  abstract={The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including large language models (LLMs), has brought transformative changes to various fields. However, deploying such advanced models on mobile and edge devices remains challenging due to their high computational, memory, communication, and energy requirements. To address these challenges, we propose a model-centric framework for democratizing generative AI deployment on mobile and edge networks. First, we comprehensively review key compact model strategies, such as quantization, model pruning, and knowledge distillation, and present key performance metrics to optimize generative AI for mobile deployment. Next, we provide a focused review of mobile and edge networks, emphasizing the specific challenges and requirements of these environments. We further conduct a case study demonstrating the effectiveness of these strategies by deploying LLMs on real mobile edge devices. Experimental results highlight the practicality of democratized LLMs, with significant improvements in generalization accuracy, hallucination rate, accessibility, and resource consumption. Finally, we discuss potential research directions to further advance the deployment of generative AI in resource-constrained environments.},

  abstract={Current studies for brain-muscle modulation often analyze selected properties in electrophysiological signals, leading to a partial understanding. This article proposes a cross-modal generative model that converts brain activities measured by electroencephalography (EEG) to corresponding muscular responses recorded by electromyography (EMG). Examining the generation process in the model highlights how the motor cue, representing implicit motor information hidden within brain activities, modulates the interaction between brain and muscle systems. The proposed model employs a two-stage generation process to bridge the semantic gap in cross-modal signals. Initially, the shared movement-related information between EEG and EMG signals is extracted using a contrastive learning framework. These shared representations act as conditional vectors in the subsequent EMG generation stage based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). Experiments on a self-collected multimodal electrophysiological signal data set show the algorithm’s superiority over existing time series generative methods in cross-modal EMG generation. Further insights derived from the model’s inference process underscore the brain’s strategy for muscle control during movements. This research provides a data-driven approach for the neuroscience community, offering a comprehensive perspective of brain-muscular modulation.},

  abstract={Deep learning and computer vision have especially improved medical diagnostics in ophthalmology and other fields. Eye diseases include cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma, and normal problems offer major challenges considering their frequency and impact on vision health. Conventional diagnosis methods rely on the subj ective and prone-to-error manual examination that ophthalmologists provide. This work investigates the use of a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture, Fine Tuned EfficientN etB3, for the automated categorization of various eye illnesses. We use a large collection of 3,424 high-quality retinal pictures taken from several repositories and annotated by professionals. We raise the quality of the dataset by using rigorous preprocessing and augmentation techniques. Fine-tuned via transfer learning, the EfficientN etB3 model shows great performance with a 94% general accuracy. Evaluations of precision, recall and F l-score show the consistency of the model across several disease diagnoses. Particularly in underdeveloped areas, the model's exceptional accuracy and efficiency emphasize its capacity to improve clinical operations, raise diagnosis accuracy, and give access to professional eye care. Our efforts provide scalable solutions for early and accurate eye disease diagnosis, therefore advancing the expanding field of artificial intelligence-driven medical diagnostics.},

  abstract={Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) foster creativity in all its forms. In particular, with the advent of extended reality (XR), we have witnessed an explosion of once unimaginable artistic creations and products, one above all the Metaverse. Dance and the process of creating dance choreography can benefit from the use of these new technologies, but so far little has been done in this regard. This paper provides an overview of the existing literature on the use of AI tools in combination with XR technology within the artistic context of dance. Furthermore, we propose new application scenarios that involve human interactions mediated by XR technologies. In particular, we focus on dance choreography performed by artificial agents driven by Swarm Intelligence mechanisms, and we discuss the perspectives and potential implications for both artificial and human creativity through the integration with XR.},
