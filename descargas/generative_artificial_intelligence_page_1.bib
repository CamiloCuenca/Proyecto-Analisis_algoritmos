  abstract={The emergence of generative artificial intelligence has had a profound impact on education. This study, based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) method, analyzes 281 studies on the application of generative artificial intelligence in education. The results of this study can assist researchers in better understanding: (1) What are the key characteristics of the literature on generative artificial intelligence in education? (2) What is the current state of research on generative artificial intelligence in education? (3) How can generative artificial intelligence empower education to promote high-quality educational development? By examining these questions, we found that generative artificial intelligence in education presents contradictions—diverse demands and limited practice. Therefore, future efforts should focus on constructing region-specific large language models, educational corpora, and prompt engineering, thus further promoting the high-quality development of education.},

  abstract={The research on computer vision mainly aims to enable computers to understand and interpret images. Computer vision is an emerging discipline, and applying generative artificial intelligence technology to image processing is an important entry point in current machine vision research. When generating images, this article utilized adversarial learning mechanisms to optimize the parameters of the generator and discriminator, creating a competitive relationship between the two and gradually improving the quality of the generated images. Adversarial training methods were used in video processing to optimize the generated model, enabling it to map between different styles and achieve style transfer. The generative adversarial network was optimized using a cyclic consistency loss function to ensure consistency of video content before and after editing. Based on the trained recurrent generative adversarial network, style transformation and content editing on the video were performed. The PSNR value of generated image 3 was 27.1; the PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio) value of the original image was 27.8; the SSIM (Structural Similarity) value of the generated image was 0.95; the SSIM value of the original image was 1.00. The PSNR and SSIM values of the generated image with image number 3 in the experiment were relatively high and close to the corresponding values of the original image. This article provided a reference for the research on the application of generative artificial intelligence in visual effects.},

  year={2024},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The manufacturing sector is in a challenging spot. Confronted with persistent cost pressures, supply chain instability, and disruptive technologies like as 3D printing and the Internet of Things. The industry must consistently optimise processes, enhance efficiency, and improve overall equipment performance. Simultaneously, there is a significant surge in sustainability and energy transition. Manufacturers are being urged to decrease their carbon emissions, embrace circular economy principles, and enhance their overall environmental sustainability. Manufacturers are under pressure to consistently innovate while still assuring stability and safety. An erroneous AI forecast in a marketing campaign may cause small inconvenience, whereas an erroneous AI forecast on a manufacturing shopfloor can have catastrophic consequences. Manufacturers are familiar with technology and disruption, but the main issue is that what is effective in principle often proves unsuccessful in practice. As producers, we have established a knowledge base; nevertheless, it is difficult for users to locate information efficiently as it requires extensive time and effort to search and navigate through the contents. Alternatively, we can establish a data lake that may rapidly deteriorate into a data swamp. Alternatively, we can continue to incorporate other applications, so perpetuating the growth of our technological debt. However, we are now incapable of updating our applications due to the presence of intricate and long-standing logic within them. The implementation requirements and applications of generative artificial intelligence differ from those of analytical AI. Analytical artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used for the purposes of predicting future events, optimising desired values, and utilising past data to enhance processes and results. Gen AI represents a new opportunity for problem solutions, as demonstrated by recent advancements in content production, insight generation, and human-like engagement. There is an urgent need for additional scholarly research to gain a deeper understanding of how Gen-AI technologies are being adopted and spread across different industries in production systems. This study represents a preliminary attempt to investigate the current utilisation of Gen-AI by corporations, as well as the advantages and difficulties it entails, and the anticipated future of these technologies.},

  abstract={To enhance teaching practices and lecture strategies, online lecturers need reliable and opportunity feedback. Post-observation feedback provides opportunities for reflection, dialogue, development, and helping lecturers to improve their teaching practices. However, this poses a significant challenge in online higher education due to traditional observation procedures requiring previously trained observers, rendering them expensive and time-consuming. In addition, the observation process has human biases such as those introduced in annotated data by trained observers. Automated solutions powered by Artificial Intelligence offer a viable alternative providing consistency and affordability, delivering actionable feedback to lecturers, thereby helping to improve their pedagogical techniques and supporting student success. Hence, analyzing the video conferencing of the lecturers in online courses would help provide feedback to instructors and insights about teaching practices to institutional leadership. Therefore, this Work in Progress describes a proof of concept on a speech processing pipeline for providing post-observation feedback using Generative Artificial Intelligence to support the reflection process about online higher education teachers' practices.},

  abstract={Social media content is relevant for many applications, including applications that assist in fighting the plague of terrorism through Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, social media content is diverse in its form - text, image, audio, and video. Depending on the nature of the applications, it may be desirable to convert all these forms into a unique format to ease processing. Once the data is converted into text, it is then possible to organize it into structured tabular data to feed Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for real-time terrorist attack detections. This paper explores using the emerging Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) tools for converting social media content (text, image, audio or video) into text format suitable for applying machine learning algorithms. The methodology of this research consisted of studying existing Gen AI tools, evaluating and selecting the best among those that offer API or code integration to implement a tool for converting all forms of social media content into text. The main limitation of this work is the small size of the datasets used in the tools' evaluation. The design and implementation of the proposed solution have been completed, and the tool is ready for use and integration into a framework for collecting and analysing social media content to fight against terrorism.},

  abstract={Since the introduction of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), education in computer science has prompted efforts to incorporate it into the educational curriculum. This innovative practice full paper presents a study into using GenAI to enhance student learning of software engineering. It outlines the initiatives to introduce GenAI into a graduate-level software engineering course in Software Verification and Validation (SV&V). The paper presents the educational goals, methodologies and findings of these endeavors in this course. The primary education goal of this course is that students have a solid understanding of principles and practices of software quality assurance and seek to introduce students to diverse techniques employed for SV&V. The study presented in this paper centers on the practical application of GenAI within the domain of testing strategies. The paper introduces the findings of an exercise where GenAI was used to apply testing strategies for unit testing. The exercise consisted of the use of GenAI in the development of unit tests for an algorithm. Rigorous assessments were conducted to gauge the effectiveness of the unit tests developed for validating the accurate implementation of the algorithm. This exploration shed light on the tangible impact of GenAI on the precision and efficiency of unit testing procedures. The findings underscore the significance of encouraging students to actively explore emerging trends and methodologies in the realm of software verification and validation. By incorporating GenAI into the educational framework, students not only gain insights into the capabilities and limitations of this technology but also foster a mindset of continuous learning in software quality assurance. The paper demonstrates that it is not sufficient to use the test cases developed by GenAI for software validation since test cases recommended by GenAI do not cover corner cases which causes gaps in coverage in unit testing. The majority of the students were able to understand the limitation of GenAI in SV&V but appreciated its support in suggesting test cases for the most common cases. This exercise allowed students to enhance their creative problem-solving through human-guided AI partnership which is pivotal in cultivating a new generation of professionals capable of contributing to the ongoing evolution of software quality.},

  abstract={The advent of generative artificial intelligence has opened new possibilities for numerous fields. This paper examines the impact of large-scale generative AI models on both virtual and robot assistants. As these models evolve, there is significant potential to enhance the capabilities of virtual assistants and enable the development of general-purpose robots capable of performing everyday tasks like making coffee. These models can also scale to assist with industrial manufacturing. While general-purpose assistants are yet to be fully developed and circulated, recent advancements in generative AI have greatly accelerated the progress toward this goal. The paper concludes that the integration of large-scale generative AI models into assistive technologies will likely lead to a new generation of AI-powered helpers.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools are advanced systems capable of generating content in formats such as text, images, or videos, which has been transforming fields such as education. However, excessive use of these tools may result in students not fully utilizing their own skills, thereby diminishing their critical thinking, analytical abilities, and information search skills. This research aims to study the perceptions of higher education students regarding GAI tools to assess their experiences with the usefulness of these instruments and their impact on learning. To achieve this, a non-experimental, comparative, descriptive research approach with a quantitative focus was employed, involving theoretical and conceptual processing. An instrument was designed to measure dimensions such as ethics, experience, usefulness, and quality. Finally, the results revealed that students use and understand basic concepts of GAI tools, recognize their limitations, and are thus familiar with them. The study also identified certain risks related to students' perception of these tools as substitutes for their teachers rather than as supportive aids and noted that they are perceived as potentially diminishing students' learning capacity.},

  abstract={This study examines educators’ views on integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education. A questionnaire was distributed across disciplines to explore AI adoption in pedagogy, common tools, and perceived benefits and challenges. While AI research often focuses on STEAM fields and K-12 education, this study includes Humanities, Sciences, and Business. The primary question investigates educators’ experiences and concerns about AI in classrooms. The sample comprises 134 teachers (balanced by sex), aged 27-71. Descriptive and inferential statistics, including Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests, analyze the data. The findings show increasing AI participation, especially among male teachers, using tools such as ChatGPT and Google Bard. Despite the benefits, concerns remain about ethics, human interaction, equity, and professional development. This study offers insights applicable to institutions worldwide and encourages further exploration of AI’s role in higher education.},

  abstract={Within the domain of robotics, effective interaction between a human collaborator and robot is a topic of great importance. With the continued advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), we propose a prototype system that utilizes GAI and seeks to bridge the gap between the human and robot. This prototype utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) combined with a vision system for detection and tracking, to allow the GAI system to control a robotic arm and manipulate objects within the action space. We model the action space within our experiments on the 3-cup Monte game where the user can prompt the system to manipulate the cups within the action space based on the ball’s location. Experimentation is done on prompts of varying lengths of sequences, and we evaluate our system based on its ability to understand the prompt and correctly execute the desired task. With this collaboration of techniques and technologies, we hope to open the possibilities and extend human and robotic collaboration into new areas. The results of our experiments show promising results to this end.},
