  abstract={Deep learning techniques have had a huge impact on artificial intelligence research. They have improved upon the traditional machine learning techniques where human expertise was required for feature engineering. By removing one human factor, they have moved us one step forward in the field of artificial intelligence. They have not entirely removed humans, though. They are required for designing the architectures and cleaning the data. Deep learning techniques have managed to achieve breakthrough results in domains such as speech recognition, machine translation, image recognition, and object detection. This chapter gives a brief overview of various deep learning techniques being used today. Techniques that make deep learning more effective have been described. Some interesting applications have also been covered.},

  abstract={In the antenna design process, predicting return loss via electromagnetic (EM) simulation is crucial for understanding the antenna's behavior. As EM simulation can be time-intensive, its role is often confined to simulating the response, and not extended to proposing alternative designs. To address this, we propose a novel artificial intelligence (AI) framework for antenna design. It comprises a regressor for accurate and fast response prediction, a generative designer for proposing a vast number of new designs that meet users' requirements, and an explainer for analyzing the impact of design parameters. Application of the proposed AI framework to the design of planar multiband antennas has demonstrated its accuracy and capability.},

  pages={448-451},
  abstract={Super-resolution face image is the basis of high detection rate in face recognition. In order to meet the requirements of super-resolution image in face recognition, aiming at the problem of texture loss of super-resolution image under high-frequency features, a face image reconstruction method based on wavelet transform and super-resolution generative adversarial network (SRGAN) is proposed to reduce the impact of low-resolution image caused by imaging hardware, network bandwidth and sampling environment on face recognition accuracy. Firstly, the wavelet transform algorithm is used to preprocess the low-resolution face image to extract the detailed texture features of the face image under different frequencies. Then, GAN is used to learn the prior knowledge of wavelet coefficients, and the identity preserving constraint is applied to the output image, and the perceptual loss function of the fusion wavelet coefficients is realized. Finally, the deep learning model based on SRGAN is used to obtain high-resolution face images. Experimental results show that the method can achieve super-resolution restoration of low-resolution face images and meet the requirements of face recognition accuracy.},

  abstract={Green bands in satellite remote sensing play an important role in monitoring water and vegetation information. Due to the lack of observed green band, the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-16) Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) sensor uses a synthetic one. This study presents an ABI green band generation method using the Pix2Pix based on conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) and convolutional neural network techniques with data observed in the visible range of the GOES-16/ABI sensor. Our model was constructed from the radiance data sets in the red, blue, and green bands of the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard Himawari-8/9 satellites from August 27, 2018 to May 1, 2019, and applied to generate a GOES-16 ABI green band using the ABI blue band radiance data. A comparison between the AHI and the Pix2Pix-generated AHI green bands displayed high accuracy, evaluated through bias = 0.120, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.983 in digital number (DN) units, and correlation coefficient (CC) = 0.999. Furthermore, comparison between the Pix2Pix-generated and synthetic ABI green bands resulted in a good agreement (bias = 1.029 and RMSE = 2.892 in DN units, CC = 0.993). The statistical comparison between the green band, and red or blue band resulted in the exceptional performance of the Pix2Pix-generated ABI green band compared to the synthetic ABI green band. Consequently, our Pix2Pix-based model can be effectively used to generate nonexistent green band of ABI sensor and be applied in a variety of scientific applications requiring green band.},

  abstract={Automating cyberattack simulations is useful for evaluating the cyber resilience of mission-critical infrastructures, such as Tactical Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs). Traditional red teaming tools lack adaptability, integration, and scalability, which limits their applicability in dynamic military environments. This paper presents an agentic generative AI system combining Cybersecurity Knowledge Graphs (CSKGs) and Large Language Model (LLM) agents. This system autonomously generates and executes context-aware cyberattack chains. The system analyzes Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) data, attack tool documentation, and telemetry data to plan and orchestrate multi-stage attacks using tools such as Metasploit and Sliver within an emulated environment. This approach aligns with the Software-defined Defence (SDD) paradigm by enabling software-driven, mission-adaptive simulation of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). We evaluate the agent system in a controlled emulated scenario, demonstrating semi-automation from semantic threat representation to system-level exploitation involving human operators.},

  abstract={A deep learning framework based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) for ovarian ultrasound (US) images synthesis is investigated. This method offers an effective solution for addressing the issue of insufficient and unbalanced data in ovarian disease research. The proposed network, built on the Triple-GAN model, can synthesize a large number of medical ovarian US images which are difficult to distinguish from the real ones. This approach effectively increases the available volume of the ultrasound images of ovarian diseases and facilitates deep learning applications in ovarian ultrasound images. It provides reliable training data replacements. The generated data were validated through professional appraisal, classification method and image metrics.

  year={2025},
  volume={},

  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Underwater images suffer from light absorption and scattering, impairs their visibility and applications. Existing underwater image restoration (UIR) methods based on generative models struggle are difficult to adapt to the complex and dynamic underwater environments characterized by illumination interference, low-light conditions, and non-uniform turbidity. To address these issues, we propose Water-CDM, a novel Adaptive Double-Branch Fusion Conditional Diffusion Model for underwater image restoration. Specifically, an adaptive double-branch fusion conditional diffusion model is presented utilizing a U-shaped full-attention network and Guided Multi-Scale Retinex with Brightness Correction (GMSRBC) to restore the challenging regions within underwater images. More precisely, to correct color casts and enhance the sharpness of underwater images, a U-shaped full-attention network incorporating Attention Blocks is designed for noise estimation during the reverse process of the conditional diffusion model. Concurrently, to mitigate overexposure during the enhancement of low-light underwater images under illumination interference, the GMSRBC method, featuring an Adaptive Brightness Correction Module, is proposed to efficiently adjust the brightness of underwater images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Water-CDM significantly improves the quality of underwater images in challenging scenarios. Encouragingly, our proposed Water-CDM yields superior restoration outcomes compared to current state-of-the-art methods on three challenging publicly available datasets. Our codes will be released at: https://github.com/HKandWJJ/Water-CDM.},

  abstract={Summary <p>This chapter discusses how data also contains more than just surface&#x2010;level information. Data analysis and Machine Learning (ML) enable people to push data usage beyond its previous limits to develop smarter artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This chapter introduces data analysis, which serves not as a lesser solution compared to generative or conversational AI but instead forms its very foundation. With the explosion of data availability on digital devices, data assumes new nuances of value and usefulness beyond its initial scope of teaching and transmitting knowledge. ML enables people to perform activities such as forecasting the future, classifying things in a meaningful way, and determining the optimal rational decision in a given context. Unsupervised learning occurs when an algorithm learns from plain examples without any associated response, leaving the algorithm to determine the data patterns on its own. Reinforcement learning is connected to applications for which the algorithm must make decisions, and the decisions bear consequences.</p>},

  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={886-890},
  abstract={Unsupervised Image-to-Image generation has obtained many studies recently, where generative adversarial networks (GANs) have developed as an effective model. Cycle consistency or dual learning guides the GAN from aligned image pairs to the unpaired training set and can be applied for many applications based on the image-to-image generation. However, for many tasks, error accumulation, which can be produced in the progress of image reconstruction, affects the realism and quality of the generated images. To eliminate error accumulation and guide the adversarial learning, in this paper, we propose dual-cycle consistent GAN (DucGAN), a novel approach for cross-domain image-to-image generation. The key idea is to introduce dual-cycle learning, which restrains error accumulation. In our method, inter-cycle and extra-cycle are based on the cycle consistency, while the output from intercycle is cast as a new augmented input in extra-cycle. On the one hand, reconstruction loss in extra-cycle can constrain and guide the training. On the other hand, dual-cycle learning is self-augmented. Our extensive experiments on image-to-image generation tasks show that DucGAN is effective and superior to several state-of-the-art GANs.},

In addition, we introduce contrastive learning to align the generated images with the visible images in terms of content. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on a publicly available visible-Infrared image pairing dataset (LLVIP) show that the proposed method generates infrared images of significantly higher quality than other state-of-the-art image-to-image translation (I2IT) methods.},

  abstract={Fingerprint recognition, a widely adopted technology in various domains, confronts significant challenges in both technical and practical realms. Therefore, it is essential to develop an effective algorithm to improve the accuracy of fingerprint recognition. In this study, a novel method is proposed to generate fake fingerprint images by Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) network, utilizing FVC2002 and FVC2004 as the dataset. Furthermore, a dataset consisting of 6, 000 fingerprint pairs, with the first 3, 000 pairs collected from the same individual and the remaining 3, 000 pairs from different individuals, is employed to train a Siamese Network. Finally, the real fingerprint image and the generated fingerprint image are used as two inputs to the Siamese Network to verify whether any two fingerprint images can be incorrectly matched. Experimental results indicate that DCGAN has an excellent ability to generate fingerprint images, although a small portion of the generated images have defects, which may be caused by the model training the blank part of the images as important features, etc. Additionally, the security verification experiment employing the Siamese Network reveals potential vulnerabilities in the fingerprint recognition system, possibly stemming from the network’s focus on localized similarities between the two input fingerprint images.},

  abstract={The realm of cryptography, rooted in neural networks, has experienced advancements following the inception of adversarial cryptography. This approach employs Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to construct neural networks capable of autonomously acquiring encryption skills. Our primary focus lies in ensuring the confidentiality of information within a multiagent system, with properties articulated in terms of an adversary. Our approach consists of a neural network named `Alice’ to create a ciphertext from plaintext and multiple keys, for data security. Simultaneously, we introduce several neural networks, collectively called `Bob,’ designed to identify and decrypt the ciphertext back to plaintext. Our system is designed to withstand various threats, including intruders possessing knowledge about the encryption process, and potentially having access to leaked ciphertext or a subset of keys. Our approach addresses the challenges posed by attackers engaging in activities like Chosen-Plaintext and Chosen-Ciphertext Attacks. Our system trains `Alice’ and `Bob’ collaboratively to counteract the impact of both intruders and attackers. Over the training process, Alice and Bob reach a state of equilibrium, enabling them to decrypt ciphers in the presence of intruders. Our implementation reveals that nearly 800 training epochs are necessary for model synchronization. Intruders are left with only random guesses about the plaintext, leading to increased errors. Even CPA and CCA attackers fail to strongly predict a probability of either 0 or 1, yielding probabilities close to 0.5. In contrast, Bob decrypts with minimal errors. Moreover, the study illustrates how increasing the number of keys results in faster learning for Bob.},

  abstract={With the advancement of network technology, real-time communication has become an integral part of daily life. However, packet loss presents a significant challenge to the quality of real-time communication. The Enhanced Voice Services (EVS) codec includes an inherent Linear Prediction (LP)-based packet loss concealment system to mitigate the effects of packet loss, but this system exhibits noticeable limitations concerning voice quality and resilience during severe packet loss scenarios. In this paper, we propose an enhancement to the EVS’s PLC performance using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based deep learning model. This model employs a generator with an asymmetric causal convolutional network and a multi-resolution discriminator for lost speech reconstruction. Experimental results show that the proposed system outperforms the inherent PLC system of the EVS codec in terms of Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ), Short Time Object Intelligibility (STOI) and PLCMOS. Additionally, subjective listening tests following the MUSHRA standard further confirmed the improvement in speech quality.},

This approach highlighted the susceptibility of these tools to modified texts and emphasised the difficulties in reliably detecting AI-created content. The analysis was conducted using the tools in their default state as black-box systems, without a thorough analysis of their underlying mechanisms or algorithms. Furthermore, the evaluation is confined to a single article on a specific topic, and as such, the performance of the tools assessed cannot be regarded as representative. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of these tools, further research and assessment involving articles from diverse disciplines and a variety of writing styles is essential.},

  abstract={This study addresses the remediation of mathematical knowledge in engineering education, a critical issue as many students lack foundational skills upon entering essential courses. We conducted a quasi-experimental study that compared traditional instruction methods with a self-study strategy across three phases: diagnosing initial knowledge, providing tailored self-study resources to an experimental group, and assessing the effectiveness of the intervention. During the first period of the Fall 2024 semester, an initial diagnostic test on key mathematical topics was administered via CANVAS in a first-year Engineering and Sciences course. The experimental group received CANVAS instructional videos, supplementary documents, and access to the AI tool Jungle for optional self-study. In contrast, the control group had access to voluntary tutoring sessions. Post-intervention, both groups completed a final exam to measure improvements in problemsolving abilities. Additionally, a follow-up survey gathered feedback on self-study materials and Jungle. The analysis shows a positive correlation between Jungle usage and academic improvement. Jungle users initially scored slightly lower, saw greater improvements, and achieved higher post-test and final scores. The experimental group of Jungle users showed a statistically significant score improvement over the control group ($p=0.05$). Qualitative feedback highlights Jungle's effectiveness, feedback, and ease of use, though students suggested enhancing question variety. Results demonstrate the potential of structured self-study interventions to improve mathematical understanding among engineering students. The theoretical implications of this work are that by emphasizing tailored resources, this study aims to contribute effective strategies for bridging knowledge gaps in STEM education, enhancing student retention, and supporting academic success in engineering programs.},

The experiment involves using AI techniques to assist in the discovery of causal relationships between the variables existing in a large clinical trial database. A peripheral vascular disease database was used to acquire a feeling for the complexities involved in developing a distributed encoding scheme and to determine the computational resources required to train a neural net for the type of data used. By testing several models the effects of changes in the encoding scheme and the number of training iterations the system needed to predict the appropriate change needed could be determined. These results were compared to the information available from other analyses of the same data. The generative capabilities of the system were then tested by training it over one sample of cases and applying it to cases it had not encountered before. Some idea of the computational resources needed in terms of time and memory capacity was developed.<>},

  year={2023},
  volume={31},
  number={},
  pages={2715-2725},
  abstract={Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) provides more precise spatial and temporal information to reconstruct stimulus images than other technologies that can be used to measure the human brain’s neural responses. The fMRI scans, however, generally show heterogeneity among different subjects. The majority of the existing methods aim primarily at mining correlations between stimuli and evoked brain activity, disregarding the heterogeneity among subjects. Therefore, this heterogeneity will impair the reliability and applicability of multi-subject decoding results, leading to sub-optimal results. The present paper proposes the functional alignment-auxiliary generative adversarial network (FAA-GAN) as a novel multi-subject approach for visual image reconstruction that employs functional alignment to alleviate the heterogeneity between subjects. Our proposed FAA-GAN includes three key components: 1) a generative adversarial network (GAN) module for reconstructing visual stimuli, which consists of a visual image encoder as the generator that uses a nonlinear network to convert stimuli images into an implicit representation and a discriminator that generates the images comparable to the original images in detail; 2) a multi-subject functional alignment module, which is used to precisely align the individual fMRI response space of each subject in a common space to reduce the heterogeneity among different subjects; and 3) a cross-modal hashing retrieval module used for similarity retrieval of two modalities of data, i.e., the visual images and the evoked brain responses. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our FAA-GAN method does better than other state-of-the-art deep learning-based reconstruction methods with fMRI.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence has the potential to revolutionize dental radiology practices. However, training AI models necessitates precise and dependable training data, which can be challenging and costly to acquire. This study aims to generate synthetic or artificially generated data using a generative artificial intelligence technique. Specifically, it investigates synthetic radiography's utility in enhancing the clinical value of panoramic dental radiographs generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a generative AI technique. We apply Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) to assess the quality of radiographs generated, finding similarities with other high-resolution tasks. Evaluating radiographic clinical realism involves having radiologists differentiate among authentic and synthetic radiographs. Our results reveal that the synthetic dental radiographs are prone to be classified as authentic showing FID as 18.1%o, indicating progress yet there exists room for refinement to achieve true degree of realism.},

  abstract={This paper explores the transformative potential of extended reality (xR) and generative artificial intelligence (AI) in architecture visualization. For heightened application, the authors mainly focus on generating monoscopic 360 images that are transferable into xR devices. Investigating monoscopic 360 architectural renderings through generative AI powered by few-shot learning methods, the authors adapt different styles while reflecting on real-life streetscapes. This research presents a methodical strategy that incorporates supplementary training through the stages of data collection and preparation, fine-tuning of hyper-parameters, and training processes. The effectiveness of few-shot learning heavily depends on the availability of high-quality training data with consistent representation, emphasizing the importance of the Data Collection and Preparation stage. The authors employ the Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) approach to facilitate few-shot learning for architectural visualization. The research underscores the considerable impact achievable through the integration of extended reality with Generative AI into the architecture and planning process, presenting a valuable and transformative tool for designing buildings that seamlessly incorporate existing physical settings with prompted aesthetic visualizations.},

  abstract={The “acceptance problem” in high energy physics (HEP) refers to the challenge of accurately modeling detector acceptance to ensure the precision of measurements. This study explores the application of Generative AI to address the acceptance problem in HEP. By training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) on simulated detector data (pseudo-data), we demonstrate its capability to learn detector responses and generate synthetic data that closely match measured distributions. A key component of our methodology is a custom generator loss function that incorporates physics-informed principles to improve training. This custom loss function penalizes deviations from the true distribution of event components, ensuring that the generated samples adhere to the underlying physics. Additionally, we trained a binary classifier to distinguish between different topological states (measured and unmeasured events) within the generated Monte Carlo pseudodata, further refining the model's accuracy. Our approach preserves correlations between kinematic variables across multiple dimensions, providing an accurate representation of the underlying physics. Validation with Monte Carlo pseudodata demonstrates the method's ability to recover true distributions even in regions with limited detector sensitivity, establishing a solid foundation for applying our framework to real experimental data. Our results highlight the feasibility and advantages of using generative AI in HEP, paving the way for broader applications in the field.},

To achieve these goals, spectrum sensing has been paid more attention, along with new approaches using artificial intelligence (AI) methods for spectrum management in cellular networks.

  abstract={In real-world long-range surveillance systems, thermal face images captured from a distance suffer from low resolution and noise, posing challenges for thermal-to-visible face image translation. Current methods assume similar resolutions and noise-free conditions between thermal and visible images, limiting their applicability. To address these issues, we propose the Degradation Adaption Network (DANet), which synthesizes high-quality visible images from low-quality thermal images. DANet combines pretrained Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) blocks with a U-shaped deep neural network (DNN) to incorporate faithful facial priors, including geometry, facial textures, and colors. Additionally, an unsupervised degradation representation learning scheme is developed to capture abstract degradation representations of degraded thermal images in a representation space. This approach allows DANet to adapt spatial features based on the degradation representation, striking a balance between fidelity and texture faithfulness using degradation-aware feature fusion (DAFF) blocks. Experimental results demonstrate that DANet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing its effectiveness in handling real-world low-quality thermal images across diverse practical applications.},

  abstract={In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been successfully applied to generate the SAR images. However, due to the fact that it is more difficult to generate the images than to distinguish the real or fake, GANs usually suffer from the problems of unstable training and mode collapse. As such, a residual and attention-based generative adversarial network (RAGAN) is proposed for SAR data augmentation. Firstly, the directional bounding box is used as a constraint in the RAGAN to limit the position of ship in the generated SAR image, which can be further set as the annotation of the SAR image for ship detection directly. After that, inspired by the residual and attention learning, a residual and attention block (RABlock) and a transposed RABlock (TRABlock) are designed to improve the generator of the RAGAN, thus preventing the whole model from gradient vanishing and suppressing the effects of speckle noise and background to enhance the quality of the generated SAR images. Experimental results on the HRSID data set demonstrate the effectiveness of our RAGAN model in SAR data augmentation for ship detection.},

  abstract={The focus of this research is on college students' writing skill improvement with the help of Generative AI offered by Grammarly and their perception after using it, including its ethical concerns. While there is no doubt that in recent years AI tools have gained traction because of the ability to enhance one's written communication, questions have been raised regarding the excessive dependency on such tools and the student's academic integrity. The modeling of User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) metric was used to complement the qualitative evaluation of opinions of students as users of Grammarly's Generative AI, with the investigation addressing specific dimensions: attractiveness, efficiency, and dependability. It has been established that students are attracted to AI and engaged when using it, though the concern for ethics regarding user control is prominent. This finding shows that ethical use is necessary when integrating AI technology into education to enhance learning without replacing critical analysis and self-learning skills; this extends the ongoing dialogue regarding the use of AI technologies in an education setting by giving precise guidance for educators and policy makers on how to appropriately use AI tools in academic role.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) possesses the capabilities of generating realistic data and facilitating advanced decision-making. By integrating GAI into modern Internet of Things (IoT), Generative Internet of Things (GIoT) is emerging and holds immense potential to revolutionize various aspects of society, enabling more efficient and intelligent IoT applications, such as smart surveillance and voice assistants. In this article, we present the concept of GIoT and conduct an exploration of its potential prospects. Specifically, we first overview four GAI techniques and investigate promising GIoT applications. Then, we elaborate on the main challenges in enabling GIoT and propose a general GAI-based secure incentive mechanism framework to address them, in which we adopt Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) for incentive mechanism designs and apply blockchain technologies for secure GIoT management. Moreover, we conduct a case study on modern Internet of Vehicle traffic monitoring, which utilizes GDMs to generate effective contracts for incentivizing users to contribute sensing data with high quality. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme. Finally, we suggest several open directions worth investigating for the future popularity of GIoT.},

  abstract={In today's world scenario, paper currency is economical in the sense that its face value is greater than intrinsic value. It is also more elastic and stable, paper currency can be counted quickly, it is easy to move and safe to store. These all are the main reasons because of which counterfeit currency recognition is crucial. Fake currency cannot be identified by human vision and due to this recognition of forged currency notes has become crucial problem because counterfeiters are using new and improved methods. The methods currently existing to determine whether the notes are real cannot be accessed by the common people and are also complex hardware based methods. There are no applications or devices available through which fake currencies can be detected and identified easily by common people. The main purpose of the project is to identify Indian paper currency with a new methodical approach using Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN). In this system, the Indian currency note features would be primarily extracted using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).The processed image data are then fed to a Generative Adversarial Network which helps to classify the currency as either real or fake. GAN consists of two main modules - Generator and Discriminator. The Generator generates fake currency images and the Discriminator identifies and labels the real and fake images.},

  abstract={In order to solve the problem that the effect of generator feature learning is not paid enough attention in generative adversarial network(GAN) for Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar(PolSAR) data, a new GAN called Entropy-based Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks (E-ACGAN) was proposed in this paper. The decomposition discrepancy was obtained by calculating the entropy decomposition of the real data and the generated data. Then the decomposition discrepancy is used to measure the similarity between the generated data and the real data. This discrepancy will be introduced into the model as an additional optimization goal of the generator. Therefore, the generator can learn more characteristics of PolSAR data to generate more realistic data. In the step of adversarial learning, the discrimination and classification capabilities of the discriminator are also improved with the generator. The experimental results on the Flevoland2 data set show that the classification accuracy of E-ACGAN is 2.36% higher than that of the original ACGAN and it is also improved to different degrees than other traditional classification methods.},

  abstract={In recent years, the growth of machine learning makes the computer can learn many things by using artificial intelligence. One method that is feared nowadays is the computer's capability to imitate something. This capability is called deep-fake. Deep-fake is the capability of the computer to imitate human characteristics such as voice, images, and video through artificial intelligence. Deep-fake is used to combine put the consisted image and video to another source of images and video using machine learning which is known as a generative adversarial network. With these capabilities, deep-fake is already used to make a counterfeit video, signature, voice signature, and much fake news. This paper is about to combine the capabilities of deep learning and the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to deal with detecting the fraud in the handwritten signature. We will focus on several types of ways to sign with the characters. The system will recommend if the hand signature of the user is fake or genuine. This is under the capabilities of GAN to synthesize the signature, it can make the computer automatically generate hand signature by using a machine. Many researchers called this capability is deep-fake. This research aims to learn the hand signature to do fraud detection. We propose an architecture to build the anti-counterfeiting hand signature which is utilized deep learning with a self-growing probabilistic method.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-17},
  abstract={Federated learning (FL) is an emerging privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared model by exchanging model parameters instead of raw data. However, data heterogeneity among clients often leads to significant performance degradation. Existing approaches primarily address this challenge by constraining local model updates to align the global model. Nevertheless, they often overlook the fact that direct aggregation of local models into a single global model can inherently introduce severe performance bottlenecks due to client divergence. To address this issue, we propose FedConsDG: Divergence-Aware Federated Distillation via Consensus-Diversity Generative Learning. Instead of simply aggregating local models, our method updates the global model on the server side via knowledge distillation from local models. Specifically, we deploy a generator on the server and propose a Consensus-Diversity Generative Learning, which encourages the generator to generate hard samples by maximizing the prediction variance among local models. These synthesized samples are then used to fine-tune the global model. To further mitigate catastrophic forgetting caused by data heterogeneity, we introduce a divergence-aware exponential moving average (EMA) mechanism to update the parameters of the generator during the distillation stage. Unlike traditional knowledge distillation techniques, the proposed framework eliminates the need for proxy data on the server, thereby offering stronger privacy guarantees. Extensive experiments on multiple heterogeneous datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  title={Authentic Assessment Design for Meeting the Challenges of Generative Artificial Intelligence}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Authentic Assessments are generally seen as alternate to traditional assessments though the scope of an authentic assessment is much larger than that of a traditional assessment. Authentic assessments help students in comprehending the subject matter and, if properly designed, can also ensure student workplace readiness. During the authentic assessment design, five most important aspects are considered and their incorporation is sought. These aspects include; the assessment objectives, the physical context of an assessment, the social context, the outcome of the assessment and the assessment criteria. Emergence of the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) supported applications and the Large Language Model (LLM) tools has posed new challenges to the authentic assessment design. Student access to these new applications and tools has also changed the socio-technological realities of the Learning and Teaching (L&T) practices. Therefore, we need to reimagine both, the L&T practices and the design and execution of authentic assessments. Keeping the prevailing socio-technological context in perspective, this work in progress paper proposes extending the scope of authentic assessments. The aim is to use them for quelling the growing problem of plagiarism as plagiarism can be facilitated by the use of GAI and LLM tools. Instead of considering authentic assessments as merely ‘an alternate to the traditional examination’ or ‘a tool for evaluating student workplace readiness,’ we propose adding ‘GAI redundancy’ to the scope of authentic assessments. For incorporating GAI redundancy we propose using either the game-based learning environment or a simulation environment. These two environments can be used for generating ‘close to real life’ problem-solving scenarios while assessing student comprehension and workplace readiness. In order to help practitioners, this paper also presents two examples of authentic assessments that were developed for combating plagiarism vis-à-vis enhancing student learning and evaluating their workplace readiness. In the first example, we show how to use a game environment and in the second example we demonstrate use of a simulation environment. The two examples also show how course contents can be embedded and how GAI redundancy can be incorporated in authentic assessments. The reported teaching assessment data and student feedback suggest that the proposed authentic assessment design and implementation strategies were able to engage students, help their comprehension and evaluate their workforce readiness.},

  abstract={Traditional psychometric evaluations often fail to reliably assess candidates due to the reliance on self-reported answers, leading to unsuitable hires and suboptimal organizational outcomes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel psychometric evaluation system that leverages Generative AI and multi-agent systems to create simulated work environments. Candidates engage in real-time, role-specific situational simulations, interacting with autonomous agents acting as virtual colleagues or clients. These dynamic interactions enable objective assessments of cognitive abilities, personality traits, and situational judgment based on authentic reactions rather than tailored responses. The system’s adaptive design ensures alignment with organizational needs, offering scalable solutions across industries. Evaluation of the system involves testing high-performing and unsuitable employees, with a mathematical model demonstrating its higher accuracy in identifying top candidates compared to traditional methods. This approach represents a transformative advancement in workforce assessments, improving hiring decisions and organizational performance.},

  abstract={Intelligence refers to the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills, which comprises three fundamental components, namely knowledge, experience, and creativity. Consequently, there exist three primary Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, namely Analytical AI, Cognitive AI, and Generative AI. Analytical AI is primarily concerned with comprehending the data and transforming it into contextualized data and knowledge. On the other hand, Cognitive AI is centered on understanding experience and aims to annotate, enrich, and utilize the knowledge, to facilitate decision-making. Lastly, Generative AI delves into the neural mechanisms involved in creative thinking and problem-solving, with a focus on enhancing the process of acquiring and applying knowledge and skills. This paper presents Knowledge Base 4.0 as the backend data for AI engines, which allows for linking knowledge and experience to enable empowering generative AI. The objective is not only to facilitate generating new content (such as text and images) but also to generate new processes when/if needed. We present the architecture of Knowledge Base 4.0 and the design and development of data services that construct and maintain this robust Knowledge Base. Additionally, we provide use cases in various domains, including health, policing, banking, and education.},

However, the scarcity of diverse and well-annotated datasets poses challenges to developing robust diagnostic models. This research explores the potential of Generative AI to address these limitations and enhance the accuracy of disease diagnosis. To address the issue, this research offers a novel method of data augmentation that applies a cutting-edge generative AI algorithm, namely Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to a subset of the “Paddy Doctor” dataset, which consists of 10,407 photos of paddy crops suffering from various diseases. GANs are employed to generate synthetic images that seamlessly integrate with the original dataset, effectively enhancing its size and diversity. Leveraging the adversarial training process, this method produces realistic images capturing detailed features of diseased crops. Numerous studies demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in enhancing the applicability and accuracy of crop disease classification models. This method proves valuable in addressing data scarcity issues within the agricultural domain.},

  abstract={Low-dose computed tomography (CT) has been widely used in medical diagnosis and treatment. Many deep networks have been proposed for low-dose CT denoising. The local receptive field of the convolution affects the network performance. For different input images, conventional neural networks always adopt a fixed number of channels which limits the performance of deep networks. To address these problems, we propose a channel-adaptive convolution and patch selection (CAPS) module to enhance the feature extraction of our network. CAPS enables our network to adaptively adjust the number of channels according to different inputs. Moreover, the concatenation of patches can expand the receptive field globally, so the shallow layer of our network can extract more global information. To further ensure the clarity of denoised images, we present a new wavelet loss function to the generator of our generative adversarial network. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our network can obtain superior denoising results.},

  abstract={In the clinical diagnosis of eye diseases, color fundus photographs usually have a very large size to distinguish local fundus structure information or conduct combined evaluation with other modalities.However, current deep learning tasks usually require reducing the original images significantly to meet the requirements of graphics card memory during model training. Therefore, we use super-resolution technology to explore how to re-enlarge the small-sized images processed by the model back to the original size for diagnostic analysis. Specifically, it extracts high-frequency components during the enlargement of low-quality images to constrain the training process, which helps maintain the original physiological and pathological information and improve reconstructed image quality. Moreover, a carefully designed image degradation algorithm simulates real low-quality color fundus photographs. Comparison experiments show the model’s effectiveness in scale x2 and x4 tasks, and image denoising experiments prove its significant inhibitory effect on noise in the reconstruction process.},

  abstract={Explainable AI (XAI) methods contribute to understanding the behavior of deep neural networks (DNNs), and have attracted interest recently. For example, in image classification tasks, attribution maps have been used to indicate the pixels of an input image that are important to the output decision. Oftentimes, however, it is difficult to understand the reason for misclassification only from a single attribution map. In this paper, in order to enhance the information related to the reason for misclassification, we propose to generate several counterfactual images using generative adversarial networks (GANs). We empirically show that these counterfactual images and their attribution maps improve the interpretability of misclassified images. Furthermore, we additionally propose to generate transitional images by gradually changing the configurations of a GAN in order to understand clearly which part of the misclassified image cause the misclassification.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers various services to users through content creation, which is believed to be one of the most important components in future networks. However, training and deploying big artificial intelligence models (BAIMs) introduces substantial computational and communication overhead. This poses a critical challenge to centralized approaches, due to the need of high-performance computing infrastructure and the reliability, secrecy and timeliness issues in long-distance access of cloud services. Therefore, there is an urging need to decentralize the services, partly moving them from the cloud to the edge and establishing native GenAI services to enable private, timely, and personalized experiences. In this paper, we propose a brand-new bottom-up BAIM architecture with synergetic big cloud model and small edge models, and design a distributed training framework and a task-oriented deployment scheme for efficient provision of native GenAI services. The proposed framework can facilitate collaborative intelligence, enhance adaptability, gather edge knowledge and alleviate edge-cloud burden. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through an image generation use case. Finally, we outline fundamental research directions to fully exploit the collaborative potential of edge and cloud for native GenAI and BAIM applications.},

  abstract={Diffusion models are a class of generative model that excels in generating high-quality images, making them the state-of-the-art among other generative models. Their impressive image generation capabilities and diverse generation patterns have garnered significant attention. To facilitate the widespread utilization of diffusion models in various domains, this article provides a comprehensive overview of their applications in the field of image generation. Firstly, we introduce the foundational theory of diffusion models and the widely adopted general frameworks. Then, we categorize the applications of diffusion models in the field of image generation into the following areas: unconditional generation, conditional generation, text-to-image translation, image-to-image translation, image super-resolution, image editing, and image inpainting techniques. Furthermore, we thoroughly discuss the limitations of diffusion models in the context of image generation and provide insights into future research and development directions in this field.},

  title={Artificial Intelligence (AI) Ethics: A Critical Realist Emancipatory Approach}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={The importance of any conversation on the ethics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) cannot be overstated as such advanced technologies now influence almost every aspect of our lives. To date, dominant approaches to AI ethics have traditionally focused on the agency of the organisations creating such AI projects (e.g. the Google AI principles), but more recent approaches focus on wider structures and frameworks that may potentially support responsible AI design (e.g. the Ethically Aligned Design framework by IEEE). In this paper, we argue that such frameworks are both incomplete and insufficient as these approaches give primacy to either agency or structure. Moreover, in both approaches, the emancipation of those for whom AI is designed is almost completely ignored. To remove these lacunae, we suggest an emancipatory approach to AI ethics based on the key tenets of the philosophy and ontology of critical realism. The stratified ontology of critical realism suggests that structural conditions may be modified to activate the mechanisms supporting any desired outcome (e.g., bias-free AI). In addition, such an emancipatory approach works towards activating the mechanisms supporting the reflexivity of the stakeholders in any specific AI context. This paper makes an argument for adopting this particular philosophical approach, and we discuss three critical realist-based mechanisms in support of our argument: ethical training of AI professionals, citizen engagement, and freedom of AI information.},

  abstract={Precision agriculture represents a paradigm shift in farming practices, utilizing technology to optimize crop management and resource allocation. However, the effectiveness of precision agriculture systems is often limited by insufficient or inadequate data. This paper explores the emerging field of AI-driven synthetic data generation as a solution to address data limitations in precision agriculture. We examine various artificial intelligence techniques for creating realistic, diverse, and balanced datasets that can supplement real-world agricultural data. The paper demonstrates how synthetic data can enhance decision support systems for tasks such as crop monitoring, disease detection, yield prediction, and resource optimization. We also address the technical challenges, ethical considerations, and future research directions in this rapidly evolving field. Our findings suggest that AI-generated synthetic data has significant potential to accelerate innovation in precision agriculture while reducing costs and environmental impacts associated with data collection.},

  year={2025},
  volume={12},
  number={6},
  pages={6607-6620},
  abstract={Mobile-edge generation (MEG) is an emerging technology that allows the network to meet the challenging traffic load expectations posed by the rise of generative artificial intelligence (GAI). A novel MEG model is proposed for deploying GAI models on edge servers (ESs) and user equipment (UE) to jointly complete text-to-image generation tasks. In the generation task, the ES and UE will cooperatively generate the image according to the text prompt given by the user. To enable the MEG, a pretrained latent diffusion model (LDM) is invoked to generate the latent feature, and an edge-inferencing MEG protocol is employed for data transmission exchange between the ES and the UE. A compression coding technique is proposed for compressing the latent features to produce seeds. Based on the above seed-enabled MEG model, an image quality optimization problem with energy constraint is formulated. The transmitting power of the seed is dynamically optimized by a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent over the fading channel. The proposed MEG-enabled text-to-image generation system is evaluated in terms of image quality and transmission overhead. The numerical results indicate that, compared to the conventional centralized generation-and-downloading scheme, the symbol number of the transmission of MEG is materially reduced. In addition, the proposed compression coding approach can improve the quality of generated images under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, and the DRL-enabled dynamic power control further improves the image quality under the energy constraint compared to static transmit power control.},

  title={PCGAN: Prediction-Compensation Generative Adversarial Network for Meshes}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={32},
  number={7},
  pages={4667-4679},
  abstract={Unlike natural images, the topology similarity among meshes can hardly be handled with classical deep learning because of their irregular structures. Parameterization provides a way to represent meshes in the form of geometry and normal images, which reflects the correlation between neighboring sample locations. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can efficiently generate images without explicitly computing probability densities of the underlying distribution. However, existing GANs such as Coupled Generative Adversarial Network (CoGAN) generally have two drawbacks: (1) Inability to process unnatural images. (2) Insufficient exploration of the inherent relation between normal and the corresponding geometry image. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient method named Prediction-Compensation Generative Adversarial Network (PCGAN) to learn a joint distribution of both geometry and normal images, which aims for generating meshes with two GANs. The consistency of two GANs for the geometry and the normal is guaranteed by utilizing a sequence of prediction-compensation pairs. The sequence can estimate the normal image from the geometry image and compensate the geometry from normal progressively. Particularly, the prediction has a closed-form expression, which provides high estimation accuracy and reduces training complexity. Extensive experimental results on facial mesh generation indicate that our PCGAN outperforms CoGAN and other architectures in retaining the geometry of the faces and in generating realistic face meshes with rich facial attributes such as facial expression and morphology. Moreover, quantitative evaluations demonstrate our superior performance compared with the methods mentioned above.},

  abstract={Tumor segmentation in histopathology images is often complicated by its composition of different histological subtypes and class imbalance. Oversampling subtypes with low prevalence features is not a satisfactory solution since it eventually leads to overfitting. We propose to create synthetic images with semantically-conditioned deep generative networks and to combine subtype-balanced synthetic images with the original dataset to achieve better segmentation performance. We show the suitability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and especially diffusion models to create realistic images based on subtype-conditioning for the use case of HER2-stained histopathology. Additionally, we show the capability of diffusion models to conditionally inpaint HER2 tumor areas with modified subtypes. Combining the original dataset with the same amount of diffusion-generated images increased the tumor Dice score from 0.833 to 0.854 and almost halved the variance between the HER2 subtype recalls. These results create the basis for more reliable automatic HER2 analysis with lower performance variance between individual HER2 subtypes.},

  abstract={With the growing ubiquity and broad usage, emojis are widely used as a universal visual language, which complements the intentions and emotions beyond the textual data. Despite the critical role of representing emotion, existing emojis neglect the subtle and complex properties of human emotion in that only countable and finite face emojis exist in a categorical manner. In this article, we propose a novel approach to facial emoji generation, which can control the emotional degree of generated emojis for more complex and detailed usage on online conversations. In other words, we develop a new emotion-aware emoji generative adversarial network, which is capable of generating an emoji that expresses a given emotion distribution. In this way, our approach aims to map fine-grained emotions to expressive emojis. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrate that our approach can successfully generate high-quality emoji-like images by representing a wide range of emotions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to use the deep generative model from the standpoint of the emoji's emotional role, which can further promote more interactive and effective online communication.},

  abstract={Operational reliability assessment is an important approach to evaluate the potential risk in the new power systems. However, the accumulated computation burden from calculating thousands of scenes in operational reliability assessment still challenges the advanced solving algorithm. To address this issue, data-driven approaches using neural networks are proposed. However, existing approaches suffer from imbalanced samples because the possibility of load shedding is extremely low. To this end, this paper proposes an intelligent operational reliability assessment approach considering sample imbalance. Specifically, the imbalanced load-shedding sample extension method is proposed based on the generative adversarial network to deal with the imbalance of the load-shedding samples in the training dataset. Besides, a novel loss function is constructed with a specific focus on the load-shedding buses. This learning strategy helps the neural networks capture the features of the imbalanced shedding loads in different buses. Finally, simulation results in the IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve an obvious improvement in evaluation accuracy and facilitate online evaluation.},

We survey both research works and tools implementing AI algorithms for anomaly detection. We found that the novel algorithms, while successful in other fields, have hardly been applied to networking problems.

The imperative to integrate generative AI into educational programs arises from the necessity to furnish graduates with contemporary methodologies that enhance software quality and streamline development processes. Nevertheless, a research gap exists concerning the systematic integration of established SE education guidelines with specific course contexts to strengthen SE education through incorporating generative AI. In response to this gap, our study presents a vision for integrating generative AI into SE education, with a particular emphasis on practical integration strategies aimed at endowing students with essential competencies tailored for contemporary software development. Aligning our vision with the knowledge domains within SE education, we delineate its application across specific areas such as code generation, auto test case completion, and others. The overall objective of these proposed initiatives is to furnish students in SE with an updated and immersive learning experience, thereby addressing the evolving demands of the field.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Research has shown that learning through quiz creation, where learners generate their own quizzes, demands a more profound understanding than learning through quiz-solving. Consequently, it is anticipated to yield greater learning outcomes. However, conventional support systems for learning through quiz creation have demonstrated that the learning outcomes vary depending on the process when learners are responsible for creating the quizzes. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the flexibility of the quiz creation is reduced when the process is streamlined and regulated. To effectively address these issues, we must clarify the quiz creation process to deepen understanding and encourage it in accordance with the process. Moreover, to facilitate the flexible quiz creation and promote a quiz creation process that enhances understanding, we focused on using an interactive generative artificial intelligence (AI). We first analyze the quiz creation process by focusing on three common types: story-based, quiz-based, and solution-based. Additionally, we develop generative AI prompts to facilitate the process. Subsequently, we conducted an experimental application of the generative AI with the designed prompts to university students. The results of the experimental application indicate that the proposed quiz creation process partially contributed to enhancing comprehension through quiz creation, and our approach successfully improved learning outcomes. This study suggests that generative AI can improve learning outcomes by guiding learners to the appropriate process of quiz creation, and that it can help with flexible quiz creation, including the "natural language expression of a quiz setting".},

At the same time, the SWAP-TEST method is used to calculate the similarity between all real samples and adversarial samples at once, thereby accelerating adversarial attacks. Experimental results show that the QASGA algorithm proposed in this paper can generate high-fidelity adversarial samples with a one-time similarity calculation on the IRIS dataset, and can reduce the classification accuracy of the BP neural network from 96.67% to 26.67%, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed QASGA algorithm.},

  abstract={The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and wireless communications has driven the emergence of semantic communication (SC), a paradigm that prioritizes context-aware semantic exchange over traditional bit-level transmission. Although enhancing efficiency and task-specific reliability, this advancing capability is accompanied by significant security challenges that remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide an overview of security challenges in SC systems, with a particular focus on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the wireless transmission and generative AI (GAI) models. To defend against risks of model confidentiality compromise and semantic feature leakage, we propose a solution integrating trusted execution environments (TEEs) for secure model inference and adversarial cryptography for the protection of semantics over realistic wireless channels. Test results show it achieves close-to-black-box attack resistance in model stealing effectiveness, and the BLEU scores of eavesdropping attackers are effectively reduced to below 0.1 across various SNR levels. Finally, we discuss potential open issues and solutions for enhancing the SC security, paving the way for future research in this critical area. The proposed framework demonstrates promising results in enhancing both model and data confidentiality, contributing to the development of secure SC systems for 6G networks.},

  abstract={As technology continues to progress, the creation of deepfakes is becoming increasingly simple and accessible. Due to developments in deep learning, artificial intelligence, and face manipulation tools, the quality of average deepfakes is steadily broadening. Deepfake technology represents the forefront of video manipulation, employing sophisticated neural networks such as auto-encoders and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to produce convincingly deceptive facial videos. Replacing the target face with a fake face in video content can be achieved quite easily using face manipulation techniques. Deepfakes can deploy the different type of deep learning algorithm's which can easily manipulate and synthesize the images and videos of a person that humans cannot distinguish from the real one. Caution should be exercised when utilizing this, as it has the potential for misuse. Identifying and detecting the manipulated video content is an essential responsibility that requires resilient methods to detect deepfake videos. There are serious concerns that deepfake technology will become a problem in the future. biometric security may become more vulnerable to malicious use in the coming years, raising concerns about its safety. Information, involving the utilization of facial recognition technology. To address these issues, detecting deepfakes are extremely crucial. Therefore, we attempt to construct a hybrid deepfake detection model which can categorize the manipulated videos and original videos. In this paper we will develop more efficient model to detect whether a video is a real or manipulated video. We will be using Res-Next Conventional Neural Network to extract frame level features and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to differentiate whether a video is fake or real type. There are various available datasets to train and test our model. Our main focus is identifying and detecting deepfake videos with high precision, effectively by using the robust method which can differentiate b/w real and deepfake video with accuracy of more than 94%.},

  abstract={Responding to the challenge of efficiently leveraging Open-source Threat Intelligence Feeds (OTIFs) to enhance organizational security, this paper presents an innovative approach to automated threat identification using machine learning. Current machine learning models require large volumes of high-quality annotated data, which is a major obstacle given the inherent scarcity of such data in OTIFs. Bridging this research gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning strategy that capitalizes on both labeled and unlabeled data to automate threat identification. Our unique contribution is an advanced iteration of the GAN-BERT framework, which incorporates a self-supervised contrastive objective function to fine-tune the BERT language model. Our experiments show that this method outperforms the original BERT and GAN-BERT, achieving a 3-12% F1-score improvement on various OTIFs datasets. Furthermore, we present an efficient method for selecting hard negatives during training, which further enhances our model’s performance. This innovative approach significantly advances the field of automated threat detection, reducing reliance on human supervision and effectively addressing the issue of limited annotated data. Thus, it offers a robust solution for strengthening security posture through proactive decision making in Cyber Threat Intelligence.},

  abstract={The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning has revolutionized healthcare, particularly in the realm of medical imaging, patient care, and personalized treatments. However, the emergence of deepfake technology, while offering promising opportunities, also presents unique challenges. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can produce highly realistic synthetic medical images (deepfakes) with potential applications in tasks like segmentation and detection. This study leverages a modified BlobGAN architecture, incorporating a self-attention block, to generate enhanced gastrointestinal images. We trained and validated our model on the Kvasir dataset, a comprehensive repository of endoscopic images. Our modifications aim to address the limitations of current deep learning models by producing synthetic images of exceptional quality that closely resemble real gastrointestinal images. Results demonstrate a lowest Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) of 15.552 and a highest Inception Score (IS) of 6.951, indicating the high fidelity of our generated images. By generating synthetic data that mirrors actual medical images, this research contributes to overcoming challenges of limited data availability and privacy concerns in the field of AI for healthcare. Ultimately, our approach has the potential to expand training datasets and improve the performance of automated classification systems.},

AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning) have been applied to the detection of DDoS attacks with satisfactory achievement. However, new types of attacks emerge as the technology for DDoS attacks keep evolving. This study investigates the impact of a new sort of DDoS attack – adversarial DDoS attack. We synthesize attacking traffic using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks with Gradient Penalty (GPWGAN). Experiment results reveal that the synthesized traffic can penetrate the systems, including Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Multi-Layer Perceptron, without being detected. This observation is an alarming and pessimistic wake-up call implying the urgent need for countermeasures to adversarial DDoS attacks.},

  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proven to be a powerful tool in generating artistic images, capable of mimicking the styles of renowned painters, such as Claude Monet. This paper introduces a tiered GAN model to progressively refine image quality through a multi-stage process, enhancing the generated images at each step. The model transforms random noise into detailed artistic representations, addressing common challenges such as instability in training, mode collapse, and output quality. This approach combines downsampling and convolutional techniques, enabling the generation of high-quality Monet-style artwork while optimizing computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the architecture’s ability to produce foundational artistic structures, though further refinements are necessary for achieving higher levels of realism and fidelity to Monet’s style. Future work focuses on improving training methodologies and model complexity to bridge the gap between generated and true artistic images. Additionally, the limitations of traditional GANs in artistic generation are analyzed, and strategies to overcome these shortcomings are proposed.},

  pages={1-3},
  abstract={A blend of unlabeled data (unsupervised) in large volume, along with a small number of labeled data (supervised), makes a semi-supervised dataset. Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems are used to label/model such data. Based on the features extracted, the unsupervised query images get labeled upon the similarity measures with the reference labeled images (one image per class). Due to the insufficient availability of trained data, modeling a CNN to act as a feature extractor will be inefficient. Hence, pre-trained models, trained upon public databases (ImageNet) and have never been fine-tuned on the target dataset, will be used as a feature extractor, which lowers the confidence over the labeling task. The proposed method will put together a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), with the chosen pre-trained model embedded inside the GAN as a discriminator, that will fine-tune the pre-trained model's weights in accordance with the unlabeled target data. These fine-tuned pre-trained models can then be used to extract features and will help to build a robust CBIR system.

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-4},
  abstract={Given the imminent introduction of Reduced Capability (RedCap) devices in 5G networks, the computational and communications limitations of these devices note new challenges for network slicing. Adaptive network slicing is required to optimize resource allocation and to maintain quality of service (QoS) across the wide variety of scenarios encountered in RedCap use cases. Finally Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) represents a promising way forward: we use it to predict network conditions, effect automatic slice reconfiguration, and govern flexible resource distribution. In this paper, we look into the handicap of genai models such as generative opposition networks (GANS) and variationally autoencoders (VAEs) assisted network slicing for RedCap enabled 5G networks. Synthetic network traffic patterns can be created by GenAI, allowing it to forecast congestion and adjust slice parameters ahead of time on the basis of what it has learned. A reinforcement learning-driven network model lends itself to real-time decision-making, which will improve spectral efficiency, lowers delays, and will result in optimized power consumption. This paper presents a framework that applies GenAI to handle slice elasticity. If network conditions were changing, be in the future or in the middle of a task, this would ensure the operation of services with minimal interruption. The method was evaluated by simulation and found to be successful in dynamically balancing traffic loads and maintaining QoS levels in RedCap scenarios. Our work demonstrates that adaptive slicing driven by GenAI greatly enhances network efficiency, making 5G RedCap deployments more robust and scalable.},

  abstract={The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) offers promising opportunities to revolutionize the operation of industrial systems and become a key enabler of future industries. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely utilized for realizing intelligent IIoT applications where AI techniques require centralized data collection and processing. However, this is not always feasible in realistic scenarios due to the high scalability of modern IIoT networks and growing industrial data confidentiality. Federated Learning (FL), as an emerging collaborative AI approach, is particularly attractive for intelligent IIoT networks by coordinating multiple IIoT devices and machines to perform AI training at the network edge while helping protect user privacy and confidential business information. In this article, we provide a detailed overview and discussions of the emerging applications of FL in several key IIoT services and applications. A case study is also provided to demonstrate the feasibility of FL in IIoT. Finally, we highlight a range of interesting open research topics that need to be addressed for the full realization of FL-IIoT in future industries.},

  abstract={Licence plate recognition has many real-world applications, which fall under security and surveillance. Deep learning for licence plate recognition has been adopted to improve existing image-based processing techniques in recent years. Object detectors are a popular choice for approaching this task. All object detectors are some form of a convolutional neural network. The You Only Look Once framework and Region-Based Convolutional Neural Networks are popular models within this field. A novel architecture called the Warped Planar Object Detector is a recent development by Zou et al. that takes inspiration from YOLO and Spatial Network Transformers. This paper aims to compare the performance of the Warped Planar Object Detector and YOLO on licence plate recognition by training both models with the same data and then directing their output to an Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network to upscale the output image, then lastly using an Optical Character Recognition engine to classify characters detected from the images.},

  pages={1160-1167},
  abstract={We present Auspex - a threat modeling system built using a specialized collection of generative artificial intelligence-based methods that capture threat modeling tradecraft. This new approach, called tradecraft prompting, centers on encoding the on-the-ground knowledge of threat modelers within the prompts that drive a generative AI-based threat modeling system. Auspex employs tradecraft prompts in two processing stages. The first stage centers on ingesting and processing system architecture information using prompts that encode threat modeling tradecraft knowledge pertaining to system decomposition and description. The second stage centers on chaining the resulting system analysis through a collection of prompts that encode tradecraft knowledge on threat identification, classification, and mitigation. The two-stage process yields a threat matrix for a system that specifies threat scenarios, threat types, information security categorizations and potential mitigations. Auspex produces formalized threat models in minutes, relative to the weeks or months a manual process takes. The focus on tradecraft prompting, as opposed to fine-tuning or agent-based add-ons, makes Auspex a lightweight, flexible, modular, and extensible foundational system capable of addressing the complexity, resource, and standardization limitations of both existing manual and automated threat modeling processes. We establish the baseline value of Auspex to threat modelers through an evaluation procedure based on feedback collected from cybersecurity experts measuring the quality and utility of threat models generated by Auspex on real banking systems. We conclude with a discussion of system performance and plans for enhancements to Auspex.},

  abstract={Botnets represent a substantial threat to cybersecurity, enabling malicious actors to execute large-scale attacks that compromise network integrity and data confidentiality. Current detection methods often fall short in addressing the rapidly evolving strategies employed by botnets. This study has an aim of designing and developing a sophisticated botnet detection system leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. By integrating machine learning algorithms and advanced data analysis methods, the proposed system seeks to accurately identify and mitigate botnet activities in real-time. The study will evaluate the effectiveness of various AI models in detecting botnet traffic, provide a comparative analysis of their performance, and propose an optimal framework for implementation in cybersecurity infrastructures.},

  abstract={Powered by advanced information technology, more and more complex systems are exhibiting characteristics of the cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS). In this context, computational experiments method has emerged as a novel approach for the design, analysis, management, control, and integration of CPSS, which can realize the causal analysis of complex systems by means of “algorithmization” of “counterfactuals”. However, because CPSS involve human and social factors (e.g., autonomy, initiative, and sociality), it is difficult for traditional design of experiment (DOE) methods to achieve the generative explanation of system emergence. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an integrated approach to the design of computational experiments, incorporating three key modules: 1) Descriptive module: Determining the influencing factors and response variables of the system by means of the modeling of an artificial society; 2) Interpretative module: Selecting factorial experimental design solution to identify the relationship between influencing factors and macro phenomena; 3) Predictive module: Building a meta-model that is equivalent to artificial society to explore its operating laws. Finally, a case study of crowd-sourcing platforms is presented to illustrate the application process and effectiveness of the proposed approach, which can reveal the social impact of algorithmic behavior on “rider race”.},

  abstract={The AI community is experiencing a profound impact from Large Language Models (LLMs), and the introduction of ChatGPT and GPT-4 is prompting a reconsideration of the potential of artificial general intelligence(AGI). However, most of the LLMs are trained in English and other high-resource languages, resulting in the unavailability of LLM and its related technologies and services for many low-resource languages. In India, where only 10% of the population is proficient in English, the need for LLM models adapted to regional languages becomes crucial.In this paper, we emphasized the need for LLM for the low-resource Odia language by evaluating the available LLM-supporting Odia language. We describe the development process of the instruction-tuning LLM model for Odia. The developed instruction tuning Odia LLM is available freely for research and non-commercial purposes.},

  abstract={Humans have studied calligraphy and calculated programs to foster creativity for years. Image generation technology using artificial intelligence and Generative Adversarial Networks is currently reaching the peak of its performance. While there are newer and newer algorithms to improve the image generation system, the output of the images is still suitable at best and only excels in their category. While it is true that some of the images generated are good enough to be used, it is still unclear whether the capabilities of AI image generation can outperform their creative human counterparts. Therefore, this literature study aims to explore the basics of AI image generation, how they work, and what factors contribute to creating art such as simple pictures. Previous studies from several years ago show that most generated images are not good enough for creative usage because they only replicate traces of their dataset. The most significant factor contributing to this is the algorithm used and how it is used to create new images. In general, the concluded that while current AI-generated images are improving, they are still not creative enough to replace human creativity.},

  abstract={In recent years, artificial intelligence technology has developed rapidly, spectrum recognition presents the characteristics of intelligence. However, with the increase of the amount of radio spectrum data, problems such as the large amount of computation of artificial intelligence algorithm and the shortage of storage and computing resources of spectrum recognition terminal become more and more prominent, resulting in low efficiency of spectrum recognition. Combined with edge computing technology, an spectrum intelligent recognition framework based on edge processing framework KubeEdge is proposed in this paper. The architecture uses KubeEdge framework to co-manage cloud server and edge spectrum recognition node. The training of spectrum intelligent recognition algorithm is realized in the cloud, and the spectrum of input signals is recognized and classified at the edge node, so as to achieve the purpose of cloud and edge collaborative recognition and improve the efficiency of spectrum recognition.},
