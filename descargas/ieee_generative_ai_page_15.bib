  abstract={This paper explores a new model of teacher self-directed learning, analyzing the advantages of large models in adult self-directed learning and discussing their feasibility in professional teacher development. Combining adult learning theories, particularly Zimmerman's self-regulated learning model, it analyzes the potential benefits of large models in teacher self-directed learning across three stages: forethought, performance, and self-reflection. These models can assist teachers in setting learning goals, providing personalized resources, and recommending learning strategies, guiding them through the learning process by answering questions and offering suggestions, and helping teachers evaluate learning outcomes, engage in self-reflection, and plan subsequent learning actions to enhance their digital literacy.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) trends vary significantly across global regions, shaping the trajectory of innovation, regulation, and societal impact. This variation influences how different regions approach AI development, balancing technological progress with ethical and regulatory considerations. This study conducts a comparative analysis of AI trends in the United States (US), the European Union (EU), and Asia, focusing on three key dimensions: generative AI, ethical oversight, and industrial applications. The US prioritizes market-driven innovation with minimal regulatory constraints, the EU enforces a precautionary risk-based framework emphasizing ethical safeguards, and Asia employs state-guided AI strategies that balance rapid deployment with regulatory oversight. Although these approaches reflect different economic models and policy priorities, their divergence poses challenges to international collaboration, regulatory harmonization, and the development of global AI standards. To address these challenges, this paper synthesizes regional strengths to propose an adaptive AI governance framework that integrates risk-tiered oversight, innovation accelerators, and strategic alignment mechanisms. By bridging governance gaps, this study offers actionable insights for fostering responsible AI development while ensuring a balance between technological progress, ethical imperatives, and regulatory coherence.},

  title={ICoT-GAN: Integrated Convolutional Transformer GAN for Rolling Bearings Fault Diagnosis Under Limited Data Condition}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={72},
  number={},
  pages={1-14},
  abstract={Limited operating data resulting from complex and changeable working conditions significantly undermines the performance of deep learning-based methods for rolling bearing fault diagnosis. Generally, this problem can be solved by using the generative adversarial network (GAN) to augment data. Most GAN-based methods, however, seldom comprehensively consider the global interactions and local dependencies in raw vibration signals during data generation, leading to a decline in the quality of the generated data and compromising the diagnostic accuracy. To address this problem, a fault diagnosis method based on integrated convolutional transformer GAN (ICoT-GAN) is proposed to improve the diagnostic performance under limited data conditions by generating high-quality signals. First, a new data augmentation model ICoT-GAN is developed. In ICoT-GAN, a novel ICoT block is designed to construct the generator and discriminator. The ICoT block achieves the integration of attention-based global information capture and convolution-based local feature extraction through the incorporation of convolution within the transformer encoder. This design allows the ICoT-GAN to comprehensively extract both global and local time-series features of raw signals and generate high-quality signals. Second, a novel data evaluation indicator, referred to as the multiple time-domain features indicator (MTFI), is designed to quantitatively evaluate generated signals’ quality by calculating the similarity of time-domain features between the real and generated signals. The MTFI can complement probability distribution indicators and provide a comprehensive evaluation of the data augmentation model’s generation ability by considering both time-series feature similarity and probability distribution differences. Finally, the effectiveness of our proposed method has been successfully demonstrated under limited data conditions using the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and Center for Intelligent Maintenance System (IMS) bearing datasets. With only 16 training samples per class, our proposed method achieves diagnostic accuracy of 99.99% and 99.70%, respectively. Additionally, the data generation time is only 1163.31 s, indicating the efficiency of our proposed method.},

  abstract={Throughout the history of education, one of the most important questions has been whether we can detect whether students are cheating on exams or whether we are really assessing their knowledge. One way to solve this dilemma is to adopt an approach where professors spend more time helping students to learn rather than finding out whether students are cheating on exams. It should also be remembered that the exam is a time to learn, not just a time to check what has been learnt. Based on these approaches, an analysis of the use of generative AI applications and tools in engineering education was carried out on the subject of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC). Students are allowed to use generative AI applications and tools to solve tasks in exams and colloquia. Some of the results of using generative AI applications and tools are presented in this paper.},

  abstract={The application of AI, or artificial intelligence, offers a novel opportunity to advance generative design in a number of mobility-related fields. The method allows for the creation of parts to be completed in a shorter time frame and has the objective of achieving multiple sustainability goals with minimal information provided at the outset. This article will present a practical case study of this method on an automotive Engine mounting bracket, a complex part that must meet a range of requirements, including those related to rigidity, strength; and sustainability. The initial 3D model will define the space constraints (design space), operating conditions, and objectives to be achieved. These may include, for example, improvements in rigidity, lightweighting and fatigue, reductions in CO2 impact, and improvements in autonomy. The result is a set of designs that respect the constraints and maximize the objectives. Subsequently, the designer may select the design that is most aligned with their preferences, taking into account additional considerations such as manufacturing simplicity, or cost. A comparative analysis was conducted between generative design and traditional design, which relies on human expertise, CAD (computer-aided design) tools, and algorithms. The weight, deformation, stress, fatigue, CO2 emissions and self-sufficiency performance of the two methods were evaluated. It was found that generative design allows for a 30% reduction in the weight of the part compared to traditional design, while simultaneously improving its rigidity and strength. The total weight reduction of many brackets for the same vehicle also results in a decrease in CO2 by 3.5 g/km and an increase in autonomy by 2.8 km.},

  title={Blind Image Quality Assessment With Active Inference}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={30},
  number={},
  pages={3650-3663},
  abstract={Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) is a useful but challenging task. It is a promising idea to design BIQA methods by mimicking the working mechanism of human visual system (HVS). The internal generative mechanism (IGM) indicates that the HVS actively infers the primary content (i.e., meaningful information) of an image for better understanding. Inspired by that, this paper presents a novel BIQA metric by mimicking the active inference process of IGM. Firstly, an active inference module based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) is established to predict the primary content, in which the semantic similarity and the structural dissimilarity (i.e., semantic consistency and structural completeness) are both considered during the optimization. Then, the image quality is measured on the basis of its primary content. Generally, the image quality is highly related to three aspects, i.e., the scene information (content-dependency), the distortion type (distortion-dependency), and the content degradation (degradation-dependency). According to the correlation between the distorted image and its primary content, the three aspects are analyzed and calculated respectively with a multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) based quality evaluator. As a result, with the help of the primary content obtained from the active inference and the comprehensive quality degradation measurement from the multi-stream CNN, our method achieves competitive performance on five popular IQA databases. Especially in cross-database evaluations, our method achieves significant improvements.},

  abstract={The emergence of autonomous driving vehicles provides a more convenient and comfortable transportation experience for human society, but it also brings some safety hazards. In recent years, due to the inherent limitations of autonomous driving algorithms, self-driving cars have been involved in multiple traffic accidents during lane-changing scenarios. To address this issue, there is a need to propose a method for generating lane-changing trajectories with specific risk levels to assist autonomous driving algorithms in conducting safety tests, thereby enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles. This paper utilizes a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to extract risk features from lane-changing scenarios and applies an autoencoder along with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to learn from and generate lane-changing data with specific risks. Additionally, an evaluation method has been proposed to verify the authenticity, diversity, and similarity of the generated data.},

Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to AI systems, with backdoor attacks emerging as a potent form of attack. Consequently, it becomes imperative to focus research efforts on mitigating discrimination and bias in AI models, emphasising ethical considerations and model interpretability. Adversarial machine learning (AML) is a critical field within AI that specifically addresses the vulnerabilities and countermeasures associated with the manipulation and subversion of machine learning models by adversarial actors. Previous research on AML focused on model vulnerabilities, attacks, and defences. However, the next phase of AML should incorporate human elements into AI design to address inherent social and demographic bias. The primary goal of this paper is to study to the field by conducting a systematic analysis of current trends, identifying future research directions, and proposing strategies to address and mitigate racial bias in generative image models. Furthermore, our aim is to foster social diversity and promote fairness in AI-generated outcomes.},

  abstract={In an era where generative AI (GenAI) is reshaping industries, public understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. This study addresses this gap by analyzing public beliefs about GenAI using the Technology Acceptance Model and Diffusion of Innovations Theory as frameworks. We adopted a big-data approach, utilizing machine-learning techniques to analyze 21,817 public comments extracted from an initial set of 32,707 on 44 YouTube videos discussing GenAI. Our investigation surfaced six pivotal themes: concerns over job and economic impacts, GenAI's potential to revolutionize problem-solving, its perceived shortcomings in creativity and emotional intelligence, the proliferation of misinformation, existential risks, and privacy decay. Emotion analysis showed that negative emotions dominated at 58.46%, including anger (22.85%) and disgust (17.26%). Sentiment analysis echoed this negativity, with 70% negative. The triangulation of thematic, emotional, and sentiment analyses highlighted a polarized public stance: recognition of GenAI's transformative potential is tempered by significant concerns about its implications. The findings offer actionable insights for engineering managers and policymakers. Strategies such as awareness-building, transparency, public engagement, balanced communication, governance, and human-centered development can address polarization and build trust. Ongoing research into public opinion remains essential for aligning technological advancements with societal expectations and acceptance.},

  title={A Novel Hybrid Quantum-Classical Framework for an In-Vehicle Controller Area Network Intrusion Detection}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={96081-96092},
  abstract={In-vehicle controller area network (CAN) is susceptible to various cyberattacks due to its broadcast-based communication nature. An attacker can inject false messages to a vehicle’s CAN via wireless communication, the infotainment system, or the onboard diagnostic port. Thus, an effective intrusion detection system is essential to distinguish authentic CAN messages from false ones. In this study, we developed a hybrid quantum-classical CAN intrusion detection framework using a classical neural network (NN) and a quantum restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). The classical NN is dedicated to feature extraction from CAN images generated from a vehicle’s CAN bus data. In contrast, the quantum RBM is dedicated to CAN image reconstruction for classification-based intrusion detection. The novelty of the study lies in utilizing the generative ability of an RBM to reconstruct the pixels in a CAN image, a portion of which is dedicated to labeling. Then, that portion of the reconstructed image is used to classify the image as an attack image or a normal image. To evaluate the performance of the hybrid quantum-classical CAN intrusion detection framework, we used a real-world CAN fuzzy attack dataset to create three separate attack datasets, where each dataset represents a unique set of features related to the vehicle. We compared the performance of our hybrid framework to a similar but classical-only framework. Our analyses showed that the hybrid framework performs better in CAN intrusion detection compared to the classical-only framework. For the three datasets considered in this study, the best models in the hybrid framework achieved 97.5%, 97%, and 98.3% intrusion detection accuracies and 94.7%, 93.9%, and 97.2% recalls, respectively. In contrast, the best models in the classical-only framework achieved 92.5%, 95%, and 93.3% intrusion detection accuracies and 84.2%, 89.8%, and 88.9% recalls, respectively.},

  abstract={Generative adversarial networks (GAN) are an emerging technology in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). It is an unsupervised learning framework that involves automatically learning a model from input data to produce a synthetic output that closely resembles the original input. GANs create datasets by making copies of false outputs based on specific inputs. GANs allow machines to generate unique content that is different from human-generated data. GANs are widely used in various image-related fields, such as image-to-text conversion, next-generation faces, high-resolution image conversion, etc. The general growth of artificial intelligence and its medical applications is increasing the efficiency of the healthcare system for patients who need rapid care. Chronic diseases, especially stroke, are now the leading cause of death worldwide. Diagnosis of stroke is often based on imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, CT scans are more common and readily available in many African hospitals, especially in Senegal. However, the need for rapid image interpretation of stroke is sometimes problematic due to variable image quality, highlighting the need for improvements to achieve better image quality. This article focuses on improving the resolution of CT images, a commonly used method in medical imaging. However, obtaining a high-quality CT scan often requires lengthy wait times and the use of limited laboratory equipment. In addition, radioactive radiation poses health risks and results in poorer image quality. Super-resolution GAN has the potential to solve this problem. Super-resolution is a method of generating high-resolution images from low-resolution images. We use the input CT dataset to generate higher quality images while keeping parameters unchanged. We found that using ResNet with GANs produced higher quality images than the original input images.},

  abstract={Deep generative vision models are now able to synthesize realistic-looking satellite imagery. However, the possibility of hallucinations prevents their adoption of risk-sensitive applications, such as generating materials for communicating climate change. To demonstrate this issue, we train a generative adversarial network (GAN, pix2pixHD) to create synthetic satellite imagery of future flooding and reforestation events. We find that a pure deep learning-based model can generate photorealistic flood visualizations but hallucinate floods at locations that are not susceptible to flooding. To address this issue, we propose to condition and evaluate generative vision models on segmentation maps of physics-based flood models. We show that our physics-conditioned model outperforms the pure deep learning-based model and a handcrafted baseline. We evaluate the generalization capability of our method to different remote sensing data and different climate-related events (reforestation). We publish our code and dataset which includes the data for a third case study of melting Arctic sea ice and >30 000 labeled HD image triplets—or the equivalent of 5.5 million images at  $128 \times 128$  pixels—for segmentation guided image-to-image (im2im) translation in Earth observation.

  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={5144-5160},
  abstract={Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are increasingly being explored and used for a variety of classification tasks in medical imaging, but current methods for post hoc explainability are limited. Most commonly used methods highlight portions of the input image that contribute to classification. While this provides a form of spatial localization relevant for focal disease processes, it may not be sufficient for co-localized or diffuse disease processes such as pulmonary edema or fibrosis. For the latter, new methods are required to isolate diffuse texture features employed by the CNN where localization alone is ambiguous. We therefore propose a novel strategy for eliciting explainability, called Feature Interpretation using Generative Adversarial Networks (FIGAN), which provides visualization of features used by a CNN for classification or regression. FIGAN uses a conditional generative adversarial network to synthesize images that span the range of a CNN’s principal embedded features. We apply FIGAN to two previously developed CNNs and show that the resulting feature interpretations can clarify ambiguities within attention areas highlighted by existing explainability methods. In addition, we perform a series of experiments to study the effect of auxiliary segmentations, training sample size, and image resolution on FIGAN’s ability to provide consistent and interpretable synthetic images.},

  pages={1787-1798},
  abstract={Commercial utilization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is expanding rapidly. However, few studies have investigated the transformative impact of GAI on business operations, with a specific focus on research and development (R&D) and advertising facilitated by AI-generated content (AIGC) empowerment; particularly, there is a lack of analysis on the impact of AIGC iteration on firms’ decision-making. The study uses the optimal control and learning-by-doing method to examine two types of AIGC strategies, the single AIGC (enhancing R&D exclusively) and the dual AIGC (simultaneously boosting R&D and advertising), to delve into their dynamic iteration effects on firms’ performance. Our findings reveal that, under the single AIGC strategy, focusing on investments in the AI training R&D sector alone can enhance the GAI smartness level more effectively than adopting the dual AIGC strategy. Conversely, under the dual AIGC strategy, firms initially tend to select GAI empowerment toward the downstream advertising sector more than the upstream R&D sector. Both strategies demonstrate enhanced profits and increased demand with higher rates of AIGC self-learning. Notably, considering the limited budget, firms prioritize allocating AI training resources to the R&D sector under the dual AIGC strategy, guaranteeing their long-term success.},

  abstract={This study investigates the transformative impact of predictive and generative artificial intelligence (AI) on the education workforce in developing countries, focusing on its challenges, opportunities, and implications. Utilizing a qualitative case study approach, we explored the AI's impacts, challenges, and opportunities on work within the education sector in ten educational institutions across three countries, through qualitative data collection methods, including semi-structured interviews, observations, informal discussions, and focus group discussions with students, lecturers, and administrative staff. The findings highlight the role of AI in revolutionizing pedagogy, enhancing student engagement, and optimizing administrative workflows. Educators reported improvements in teaching strategies driven by AI-powered adaptive learning platforms and AI-generated resources, which enable personalized and dynamic learning experiences. However, the research also revealed key challenges, such as resistance to AI adoption, concerns over data privacy, and infrastructure limitations that hinder effective integration. A cross-case analysis emphasized the evolving role of educators, highlighting shifts in teacher-student dynamics and potential increases in job satisfaction, tempered by new responsibilities. While students benefit from personalized learning paths, they also face hurdles related to digital literacy and unequal access to AI-driven resources. Ethical considerations around AI deployment emerged as critical, underscoring the need for clear guidelines and strong policies. The study concludes by offering recommendations for educational institutions, policymakers, and AI developers to collaborate in fostering an innovative, inclusive, and ethically responsible educational landscape. Future research is encouraged to expand on these findings across different educational contexts and explore the long-term effects of AI on teaching, learning, and workforce dynamics.},

This study compares the efficacy of GenAI with video-based active learning methods for teaching programming to university students. Through an experimental design with 40 computer engineering students, academic performance, perception of usefulness and ease of use, and satisfaction and motivation were evaluated. The results showed no statistically significant differences between the groups in academic performance, perception of usefulness and ease of use, or satisfaction and motivation. Both methods proved equally effective in improving learning and maintaining student motivation. These findings suggest that GenAI can be a viable alternative to traditional methods, offering opportunities to diversify pedagogical strategies in programming education.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, a quasi-experimental study was conducted. Independent samples t-tests were used to compare pre- and post-test results. The findings revealed a significant improvement in students' computational thinking after participating in the GAI-enhanced project-based learning activities. Specifically, significant differences were observed in the sub-dimensions of creativity, algorithmic thinking, and problem-solving ability. However, no significant differences were found in the sub-dimensions of collaborative ability and critical thinking.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of the digital creative industry, there has been a dramatic surge in the demand for processing massive amounts of data and generating personalized visual content. Traditional visual image generation technologies struggle to meet these demands, particularly in terms of detail representation, semantic consistency, and the efficiency of image generation. In this study, we propose a method based on a Dynamic Attention-enhanced Generative Adversarial Network (DA-GAN). By constructing a network architecture that includes a progressive upsampling generator embedded with a CBAM module and a discriminator combining PatchGAN with global average pooling, we optimize the model using an improved Wasserstein GAN adversarial loss, a perceptual loss based on a pre-trained VGG-19 model, and a style loss calculated via the Gram matrix. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to methods such as StyleGAN2 and SAGAN, DA-GAN achieves significant improvements in metrics like PSNR and SSIM, exhibits a lower FID value, and generates images with richer details and stronger semantic consistency. Additionally, DA-GAN offers notable advantages in computational efficiency and exhibits lower growth in memory consumption. This study provides an effective solution to the challenges faced by traditional visual image generation technologies in detail representation, semantic consistency, and generation efficiency, with broad application prospects.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-4},
  abstract={Whilst the task of creating music sequences through artificial intelligence has been met with a lot of attention, current approaches tend to stumble when it comes to capturing rich structures and subtle detail in musical compositions. Conventional models lack the capacity to build temporal dependencies as well as incorporate condition mechanisms (such as genre or mood), counteracting in less-ideal generation quality. In this work we address the above limitations and propose a hybrid model incorporating Dynamic Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) [15] and Generative Adversarial Network for music sequence generation from MIDI files. Our proposed approach utilizes a piano-roll representation and an event-based encoding for pre-processing, retaining structural as well as temporal complexities of music samples at the level of events. Meanwhile, the CVAE part (in a Seq2Seq architecture) is introduced to model conditioned latent distribution over music sequence attributes such as genre or composer identity in order contribute both generation and reconstruction of realistic musical samples. Furthermore, a Conditional GAN (cGAN) along with Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) is utilized for generating sequences of better quality by creating more realistic and conditionally plausible music samples. The results we show demonstrate that this hybrid CVAE-GAN framework can not only significantly improve the quality of generated music sequences (in terms like FAD) but also allow for a better listening experience, outperforming state-of-the-art evaluation methods. The work sets up a potential future in which AI helps musicians compose more nuanced music that is almost indistinguishable from the product of human creativity.},

  abstract={With the advancements of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models, their capabilities are expanding significantly beyond content generation and the models are increasingly being used across diverse applications. Particularly, GenAI shows great potential in addressing challenges in the electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem ranging from charging management to cyber-attack prevention. In this article, we specifically consider Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV) and we categorize GenAI for IoEV into four different layers, namely, EV’s battery layer, individual EV layer, smart grid layer, and security layer. We introduce various GenAI techniques used in each layer of IoEV applications. Subsequently, public datasets available for training the GenAI models are summarized.

Notably, the emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has garnered rapid attention and interest in a short period with the introduction of ChatGPT. Many individuals have extensively discussed and evaluated this AI-powered language model, from researchers to casual internet users. Importantly, Generative AI applications are increasingly recognized for their potential in educational contexts. In the realm of education, AI has the potential to significantly broaden and improve teaching and learning in higher education. However, while numerous studies have explored the effectiveness of Generative AI applications in programming language learning, an absence of research examining their impact comprehensively exists. Hence, this study aims to identify the factors that affect the successful utilization of Generative AI applications in the context of undergraduate programming language learning, with a particular emphasis on the viewpoints of university students.

  abstract={Generating fine-grained, realistic images from text has many applications in the visual and semantic realm. Considering that, we propose Bangla Attentional Generative Adversarial Network (AttnGAN) that allows intensified, multi-stage processing for high-resolution Bangla text-to-image generation. Our model can integrate the most specific details at different sub-regions of the image. We distinctively concentrate on the relevant words in the natural language description. This framework has achieved a better inception score of $3.58\pm .06$ on the CUB dataset. For the first time, a fine-grained image is generated from Bangla text using attentional GAN. Bangla has achieved 7th position among 100 most spoken languages. This inspires us to explicitly focus on this language, which will ensure the inevitable need of many people. Moreover, Bangla has a more complex syntactic structure and less natural language processing resource that validates our work more.},

  abstract={In recent years, evolutionary computation has signif-icantly advanced in processes related to machine learning. How-ever, the reciprocal integration of machine learning techniques into evolutionary computation remains relatively unexplored. Machine learning can substantially enhance the understanding of processes within Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) by harnessing its proficiency in identifying patterns and employing data-driven approaches. Existing studies lack a comprehensive understanding of the intricate interaction between machine learning models and evolutionary algorithms, necessi-tating prioritized investigation to ensure the efficacy, reliabil-ity, and compatibility of integrated models within optimization frameworks. This paper addresses this gap by examining the behavior of using Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models as a population variation operator in Multi-objective Optimization Problems. Our experimental results reveal that Generative AI, particularly Distributional Adversarial Networks (DANs), sur-passes the performance of a traditional Generative Adversarial Network. Furthermore, DANs improve the population by gen-erating novel non-dominated solutions and augmenting overall performance and diversity. This study reveals the potential of the integration of Generative AI in evolutionary computation, presenting a pathway for advancements in addressing common challenges within multi-objective optimization problems.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way programming is taught and learnt and is redefining t he way programming skills are assessed in the continuously changing field of computer science education. This paper introduces a novel approach for teaching and evaluating programming knowledge by reversing Bloom's taxonomy in order to accommodate AI-powered learning. Traditionally, Bloom's taxonomy progresses from basic cognitive skills like remembering and understanding to advanced skills like creating. With AI tools such as WebSim.ai and Anthropic Artifacts now capable of generating sophisticated outputs, the focus shifts away from students' ability to create, as these tools handle that task effectively. Instead, this paper proposes placing a higher emphasis on students' ability to understand and critically analyze AI -generated solutions, assessing their comprehension and ability to reverse-engineer existing work. We call this the Reverse Bloom Taxonomy, where students begin with creation and then move toward deeper understanding of the subject matter. This paper outlines the methodology for applying this reversed framework in programming education and presents a promising concept for improving student learning outcomes. The discussion addresses challenges in implementation and emphasizes the strategic integration of AI -driven learning to prepare students for a technology-driven workforce.},

  abstract={This study explores the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in education, particularly in teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL) in higher education. AI has been applied in TEFL since the 1950s and developed significantly over the decades. However, it has received global attention in the last two years after introducing ChatGPT and other similar Generative AI (GenAl) applications. Implementing AI provides benefits and challenges to educators and students in English learning and teaching (ELT). This study examines systematic literature reviews regarding the benefits and challenges of employing AI toward ELT in higher education. This study synthesizes previous research to enhance insights into TEFL by applying AI effectively. Applying AI to teach English as a foreign language has several benefits and challenges. These can be summarized in the dimensions of using machine learning, chatbots, intelligent virtual environments, translation tools, multidimensional ethics, and social media. Each dimension provides valuable benefits and considers the challenges for educators in delivering English as a foreign language at the university level. The benefits of utilizing AI in TEFL are evolutionary and revolutionary changes in teaching methods, personalized learning environments, better management, and more accessible education. Despite these benefits, the challenges of utilizing AI can be identified as computational issues, limited language exposure, and lack of human interaction. Furthermore, this study can enhance the understanding and insight of implementing AI in teaching English as a foreign language by minimizing the challenges and optimizing the benefits of AI.},

  abstract={The objective of video anomaly detection is to distinguish events within videos that deviate from expected normal behavior. An effective anomaly detection model requires strong spatio-temporal feature extraction capabilities to capture both appearance and motion information from the video. We utilize a generative adversarial networks model to perform anomaly detection by predicting future frame. The model is trained with multi-objective loss function for appearance and motion constraints. We introduce multi-objective optimization algorithm to guarantee the convergence of training objectives, including intensity loss, gradient loss for appearance constraints, optical flow loss for motion constraints and adversarial loss for adversarial training. By ensuring corresponding generative outcome for both normal events to confirm to expectation and anomaly events not to do so, we obtain an anomaly detection model with satisfying experimental result on video anomaly detection datasets, showing the success of the proposed training strategy.},

  abstract={Text to face generation is a sub-domain of text to image synthesis. It has a huge impact on new research areas along with the wide range of applications in the public safety domain. Due to the lack of dataset, the research work focused on the text to face generation is very limited. Most of the work for text to face generation until now is based on the partially trained generative adversarial networks, in which the pre-trained text encoder has been used to extract the semantic features of the input sentence. Later, these semantic features have been utilized to train the image decoder. In this research work, we propose a fully trained generative adversarial network to generate realistic and natural images. The proposed work trained the text encoder as well as the image decoder at the same time to generate more accurate and efficient results. In addition to the proposed methodology, another contribution is to generate the dataset by the amalgamation of LFW, CelebA and locally prepared dataset. The dataset has also been labeled according to our defined classes. Through performing different kinds of experiments, it has been proved that our proposed fully trained GAN outperformed by generating good quality images by the input sentence. Moreover, the visual results have also strengthened our experiments by generating the face images according to the given query.},

  pages={1-1},
  abstract={The emerging 6G-IoT paradigm is driving communication toward intelligent services, semantic communication enables efficient semantic sharing via artificial intelligence (AI), significantly boosting communication efficiency. However, current semantic systems suffer from black-box decision-making, while existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods face two key challenges: explicability granularity mismatch and closed-loop optimization gap. To address these, we propose a semantic communication framework integrated with XAI (XAI-SCS). Specifically, we first design an explainable semantic codec architecture enhanced by Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KAN), where traditional fixed activation functions are replaced with learnable and parameterized ones, enabling function-level visualization to improve model explainability. Second, we develop an explainable semantic transmission module driven by contrastive learning that enhances the robustness of semantic transmission, and incorporating a semantic separability metric to quantify channel impacts on semantic integrity. Third, we introduced a KAN-enhanced causal semantic decoder, which integrates counterfactual interventions to generate pixel-level difference maps. We also propose a contrastive explanation consistency metric to evaluate the sensitivity of key features, enhancing the quality of the reconstruction. The experimental results show that our approaches enhance explainability across the entire decision process, achieve a significant accuracy improvement of up to 55% on the CIFAR-10 dataset with a bandwidth compression ratio of 1/25, and also obtain competitive image reconstruction quality in increasing compression levels.

  abstract={With the increasing sophistication and variety of cyberattacks in network environments, traditional rule-based intrusion detection systems have proven insufficient to address advanced threats such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). This study presents an LSTM-based network intrusion detection model that incorporates GAN-based oversampling to address the class imbalance issue commonly found in network traffic data sets. By generating synthetic attack samples, the proposed model aims to enhance the anomaly detection performance. Comparative experiments with alternative approaches, including SMOTE and One-Class SVM, demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of GAN-based oversampling for intrusion detection.},

  pages={57-70},
  abstract={In the wave of technological innovation, generative artificial intelligence tools provide college students with personalized learning experience, promote autonomous learning and exploratory learning, and improve learning outcomes through intelligent tutoring and instant feedback. However, existing research shows that generative artificial intelligence tools still face multiple obstacles in practical application, such as differences in students' acceptance of new technologies, privacy protection challenges, and difficulties in integrating with the existing education system. This study is based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), a technology acceptance model, and specifically introduces perceived risk as a moderating variable. Combining key factors such as college students' cognitive characteristics and technological environment, this study constructs a theoretical model that affects college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools.The study found that performance expectations, effort expectations, social influence, and convenience conditions have a significant positive impact on college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools; effort expectations have a positive impact on performance expectations; convenience conditions have a positive impact on effort expectations; effort expectations mediate the relationship between convenience conditions and willingness to use; and perceived risk negatively moderates the impact of convenience conditions on willingness to use. It is expected that through this empirical study, the key factors that affect college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools will be deeply explored, and valuable suggestions and references will be provided for guiding technology optimization and education integration practices, which will help develop generative artificial intelligence tools that better meet the needs of college students and promote innovation and improvement of online education models.},

  pages={1946-1950},
  abstract={Before CNN, image recognition methods mainly relied on artificial design features, which can only represent the medium and low-level information in the image, and it is difficult to extract the deep-level information of the image. CNN simulates the human brain by establishing a deep neural network to analyze, learn and interpret data. It has strong expression ability and generalization ability, and can better represent the deep-seated information of images. At present, CNN has been widely used in many scenes, including image classification, speech recognition, video analysis, document analysis and so on. Most of the existing artificial intelligence image recognition systems are implemented by software and often accelerated by GPU. However, GPU has high power consumption and is not suitable for CNN reasoning, so it can not make use of the parallel computing power of CNN. To solve the above problems, this paper studies the application method of CNN image recognition acceleration and Optimization Based on FPGA, designs and optimizes the CNN forward model by using Intel FPGA board. The experimental results show that FPGA has low power consumption, the power consumption of CPU is 2.1 times, while the power consumption of GPU is 6.5 times. The average recognition time of the algorithm is 50% shorter than that of Lenet-5,AlexNet and VGG16, and the recognition time of 10000 sample pictures is 165μs. Compared with 426.6μs required by DSP chip system. Compared with the methods proposed in the literature in related fields in recent years, the proposed method has higher throughput and computational performance.},

  abstract={Educators have raised concerns about the utilization of ChatGPT in generating unoriginal text and the possibility of plagiarism. To address these concerns, various AI text detection software tools have been developed to evaluate whether a text is AI generated or human generated. The aim of this research is to empirically examine the accuracy of AI detection tools in identifying AI-generated texts. An experiment was conducted using textual data generated by ChatGPT, which was assessed using Turnitin and four other AI detection tools. Through multiple iterations and interventions, the text was paraphrased by ChatGPT until it appeared original and could not be detected as AI-generated by Turnitin’s AI detection tool. The findings revealed that all the AI detection software tools that were examined failed to detect the AI-generated text by ChatGPT in the final iteration. The findings provide valuable insights that have implications for various stakeholders, including educators, researchers, and AI text detection software developers. Based on the tools examined, educators and researchers do not need to set a specific threshold or percentage, including 0%, to determine what qualifies as acceptable AI-generated text. This is because establishing such a threshold can be misleading, considering the current limitations in the algorithms of these tools. Furthermore, the data generated in this paper can provide a solid basis for replicated research or software testing and assessment. It can be utilized to evaluate the accuracy of alternative AI detection tools and any future advancements in the tools mentioned in this investigation.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={379-384},
  abstract={Recent studies have indicated that the private client images in federated learning can be restored through the shared global model by gradient based inversion attacks. These attacks often employ gradient matching strategy to align the gradients of the reconstructed dummy data with the real data, thereby bringing the dummy images look similar to the actual private images. However, due to the inherent characteristic of high dimensional search space, directly optimizing the dummy images is easy to cause reconstruction failure. In addition, the quality of restored images is significantly sensitive to the data initialization method. Therefore, in this paper, we would like to introduce a novel generative gradient inversion, named GGI, attack algorithm where the dummy images are generated on low-dimensional latent vectors through a pre-trained generator. Compared to the common entire data reconstruction, optimizing the random vectors dramatically reduce the dimension of search space. Our empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively enhance the quality of restored images.},

  abstract={This research-to-practice full paper aims to analyze the public's comments on generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in computer science (CS) education, by the BERT-based model and Large Language Model (LLM) approaches to sentiment analysis and contextualize the results within broader educational and technological landscapes. Artificial intelligence (AI) has played a crucial role in advancing technical development throughout many areas. Evidence points toward the likelihood of major developmental breakthroughs unfolding soon in those sectors. Education is one such area. While there is certainly a possibility for hype and unfulfilled promises, the advent of available GAI platforms, such as ChatGPT, has caused a surge of scholarly interest in the impact of these technologies on CS education. Amid the growing debate, both the potential benefits and concerns of GAI in this sector are increasingly coming to the fore as people grapple with the tradeoffs associated with these technologies when applied in education settings. One can imagine the range of conversations around the topic, but that is difficult to use as input for policymakers and administrators without a more concrete understanding. To wit, there remain open questions about which benefits and concerns people tend to focus on when discussing GAI in education. This large-scale qualitative study addresses that gap by exploring the public's perspectives on GAI in CS education. We engage in this work by collecting and analyzing data from social media platforms, specifically Reddit comments. The social media dataset was analyzed using machine learning (ML) techniques to identify topics based on sentiment analysis. The study's objective was to document and characterize the public's perspectives concerning the general characteristics of GAI, its features related to learning, and its usability in educational settings. Through sentiment analysis using Large Language Models (LLM), the study revealed an overall positive public perception toward using generative AI in CS education, with over 57% of comments being favorable, while also identifying prominent topics of interest and concerns, such as the potential benefits of personalized learning support and automated grading, as well as issues like academic dishonesty, perpetuation of biases, over-reliance on AI hindering critical thinking, displacement of human instructors, and the need for updated curricula. The insights gleaned from the analysis will be instrumental in computing educators gaining a more profound comprehension of GAI 'srole in education and the subsequent development of GAI -enriched curricula.},

  abstract={Despite AI transforming algorithmic trading, the lack of transparency in these systems, sometimes referred to as “black boxes,” hinders wider confidence and acceptance. This proposed research presents a novel approach to uncovering the decision-making process of AI-driven trading strategies.

This methodology surpasses conventional methods of explain ability by transforming the intricate, data-derived understandings of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement-learning agent into easily understandable visual representations. More precisely, we utilize saliency maps to emphasize the crucial market elements that affect the agent's actions, offering an unparalleled level of understanding of its operational reasoning. Our assessment highlights the effectiveness of these visualizations in improving human comprehension, thus closing the gap between advanced AI capabilities and practical financial experience.

  abstract={The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in cyberattacks poses critical challenges to organizational cybersecurity as traditional defense mechanisms become increasingly obsolete. Despite this growing threat, there is limited systematic understanding of how organizations can effectively respond. This study conducts a systematic literature review to analyse organizational defense strategies against AI-driven cyber threats. We examined 26 peer-reviewed articles published between 2019 and 2024, selected from key databases, including Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, and Google Scholar, using PRISMA methodology. We identified three primary defense mechanisms through thematic analysis: AI-enhanced threat detection systems, adaptive security frameworks, and human-AI collaborative approaches. Our findings indicate that organizations implementing AI-based defense systems showed a 40% improvement in threat detection rates. However, 73% of organizations needed help maintaining up-to-date AI models against evolving threats. The review reveals a critical need for dynamic defense architectures that combine real-time AI adaptation with robust human oversight. These findings contribute to theory and practice by providing a comprehensive framework for organizational resilience against AI-driven cyber threats. Future research should address the identified gaps in real-time threat response systems and explore the ethical implications of AI-driven cybersecurity measures.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), IoT devices find applications in various domains. The data generated by these devices is utilized for analysis and services, especially in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) applied to IoT, known as AI of Things (AIoT). The enhancement of edge device computing power in the IoT has led to the emergence of research areas like edge–cloud synergy AI theories and application services. In the context of lifelong learning and real-time processes in AIoT edge–cloud synergy services, addressing unseen tasks becomes crucial. Unseen tasks arise when inference requests from edge devices involve models not present in the cloud’s model repository. Addressing these challenges involves generating data to either augment small sample problems or alter the data distribution for heterogeneous sample issues. As the application of large language models (LLMs) for data generation gains traction, challenges emerge in the context of AIoT edge–cloud synergy services. First, fine-tuning LLMs with heterogeneous data exacerbates model bias issues. Second, the substantial data requirements for training LLMs pose a contradiction. Finally, the involvement of manual annotation in LLM-based data generation introduces complexity and cost. This article proposes a framework Seafarer to these challenges using generative adversarial networks and self-taught learning. Seafarer avoids model bias, reduces data requirements, and eliminates the need for manual annotation. The design demonstrates effectiveness theoretically and is validated on the Cityscapes data set, achieving an 80% reduction in training loss and improved validation loss stability.},

  abstract={Based on emerging artificial intelligence (AI) tasks, cloud-edge–terminal architecture can provide powerful computing, intelligent interconnection, and real-time response, which can also be regarded as AI-driven network. Unfortunately, multiple network layers in the AI-driven network usually face various types of network threats, such as malicious network reconnaissance, side-channel attacks, and distributed denial of service (DDoS). Traditional security solutions respond to network threats after the occurrence of attacks. To solve this problem, the concept of moving target defense (MTD) has been proposed as a proactive defense mechanism that aims to defend against cyber attacks before they occur. In this article, we first provide a thorough analysis of the threats in the cloud-edge–terminal network. Then, we conduct a comprehensive survey to discuss the concept, design principles, and main classifications of MTD. Next, we further introduce the development potential in terms of AI-powered MTD on each network layer. Meanwhile, we also explore how MTD improves the security of AI algorithms. Lastly, we describe the existing challenges and research directions of MTD. The aim of this article is to provide an in-depth understanding for the readers on how to realize the integration between MTD and AI-driven network.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) stands at the forefront of the banking sector's technological revolution, promising enhancements in decision-making, risk management, and customer interaction. This paper examines Gen AI's potential to inject innovation and efficiency into banking services, with an estimated value addition of up to $340 billion annually. Grounded in advancements in NLP through Transformer architecture and evolving GPT models, Gen AI's applications in the banking industry are extensive. They range from personalizing customer service with AI-driven chatbots to revolutionizing credit scoring and trading strategies. However, alongside these opportunities, the paper addresses the significant challenges of regulatory compliance, ethical data usage, and the technical integration of AI systems. With the impending release of the EU's AI Act and existing GDPR and DORA, financial institutions must strategize to align with new standards while harnessing Gen AI's capabilities for process optimization and enhanced service delivery. The role of international standards such as ISO/IEC 42001:2023, ISO 31000:2018, ISO/IEC 23894:2023, NIST AI 600-1 and ISO/IEC 23053:2022 is considered to be beneficial in establishing a common framework for managing AI systems, ensuring data integrity and promoting transparency. By adopting these standards, banks can facilitate compliance across various jurisdictions, enhancing operational consistency and reliability – but certain significant limitations in addressing specific regulatory requirements must be taken into account. The paper concludes that Gen AI's future in banking will be transformative, driven by the industry's need to balance technological innovation with ethical and regulatory requirements and process standardization, which will lead to more transparent, personalized and efficient banking services.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence tools are getting increasingly incorporated into journalism workflows globally. Despite growing concerns among journalists about the privacy risks of AI tools, there is limited scholarly research on how journalists understand AI-related privacy, security, and data protection, particularly in Africa. To address this gap, this study investigates journalists' mental models around privacy policies and data handling by Artificial Intelligence companies responsible for the tools they use. We conducted a qualitative study which interviewed 20 journalists working in Nigeria about their use of GenAI tools in fulfilling their duties, ranging from information verification to reporting. The data collected was analysed using reflexive thematic analysis to draw patterns in the journalists' assumptions about GenAI privacy and the security of their data when interacting with these AI tools. Nigeria was chosen as our case study due to its significance as Africa's largest democracy, and as a country whose AI policy acknowledges and seeks to promote data privacy and security. Our interviews found that journalists have a less-than-ideal mental model of privacy policies and data handling practices by AI companies, leading to potential risk in AI-assisted journalism. We also noted a willingness to share data with AI companies in exchange for some form of value, including better technology, and journalism-specific agentic AI. We conclude that the journalists are willing to do the right thing but lack the time, resources and guidance to do so.},

  abstract={Deep fakes are becoming increasingly realistic because to the quick development of artificial intelligence, especially with the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This presents serious threats to security and privacy. Since deepfakes can be used maliciously to distort photos, movies, and sounds, it is imperative that they are detected as soon as possible. In this paper, a hybrid deep learning model that combines the advantages of Residual Neural Networks (RESNET) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Channel-Wise Attention Mechanisms is presented as a comprehensive method for deepfake detection. The suggested model seeks to precisely detect regions of the face that have been altered and classify faces as authentic or modified. To focus on important facial traits, the model combines the generative capacity of GANs with the discriminative skills of RESNET, which are enhanced by Channel Wise Attention Mechanisms. DFDC, FaceForensic++, CelebDF, and other benchmark datasets are used to assess the performance of this hybrid model. With a precision of 0.79, recall of 0.88, F1-score of 0.83, accuracy of 0.83, and ROC AUC Score of 0.825, it has high performance characteristics. Furthermore, the model undergoes testing against hostile attacks and proves its resilience in actual situations. In addition to accurate deepfake identification, our method offers comprehensive localization of changed regions, which provides important information about which specific facial features have been altered. This feature improves the model’s usefulness in cybersecurity, social media content moderation, and identity verification. This research extends the field of deepfake identification and helps to build more dependable and secure digital systems by tackling the detection as well as the localization of fake characteristics.},

While over 81 % of respondents reported using AI tools for study purposes, more than 89% did not receive any education about AI and expressed a need for such education. Generative AI tools for text creation are the most frequently used type of AI tools, but students still require additional knowledge to use them effectively. AI tools are also utilized for seeking advice, finding information, being available 24/7, and assisting in writing student papers, though not yet on a massive scale.

The following paper undertakes a comprehensive examination of the insights on principles and methodologies employed in recognizing Deep Fakes from authentic media assets. At the heart of the detection challenge lies the inherent differences in the generation processes of Deep Fakes compared to genuine content, necessitating the development of specialized detection techniques. Multiple approaches have been proposed, enclosing both traditional and cutting - edge methodologies.

  abstract={The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology into satellite-based Internet services offers a new method for optimizing predictive beamforming that will boost both ease of use and cost efficiency.Old-fashioned beamforming technique is based on determinism and historical information methods which often cannot adapt to environmental change, network congestion or user mobility. This article explores how generative AI models (like variational autoencoders [VAEs], generative adversarial networks [GANs], or transformer-based architectures) can help to forecast optimal level settings for a beam in real-time.Using huge amounts of satellite telemetry, weather patterns and user traffic data, generative AI can synthesize realistic future network states, cut down on latency and improve signal coverage.AI-driven beamforming entails architectural considerations, training methodologies, and deployment issues. In addition to our review of the performance metrics such as beam alignment accuracy or spectral efficiency, we match nextgeneration predictive models against traditional methods based on statistical analysis and other data manipulation techniques. The results suggest that generative AI can bring a great enhancement to satellite Internet services. This new technology will not only improve coverage but also reduce handover failure rates and power allocation, establishing the groundwork for nextgeneration satellite communication systems that are AI-first.},

  abstract={As an acute disease, facial paralysis has high requirements for the point of treatment, and if we cannot accurately grasp the period in which the patient is suffering from the disease, we may miss the optimal time for treatment, which may affect the condition. We need to establish intelligent auxiliary diagnosis methods for facial palsy, in which AI-based methods rely on a large number of training samples. However, facial paralysis image samples are small, resulting in low model accuracy, which cannot meet the needs of clinical applications. Therefore, we plan to expand the facial palsy samples through data augmentation methods to reduce the training sample requirements and improve the accuracy of facial palsy grading. We propose the method of fusing generative adversarial networks, where the collected facial paralysis samples are trained by DragGAN model to expand the sample space, and then input into ResNet152 model for classification training. The classification effect of facial palsy images is effectively improved by the principle of data augmentation before classification. The accuracy of this experimental method on the MEEI facial palsy dataset is 85.5%, the recall is 81.4%, and the F1-score is 80.7%, which are 13.1%, 16.7%, and 15.8%, respectively compared to the method without data augmentation. A facial palsy classification model incorporating generative adversarial networks achieves higher classification accuracy compared to methods without data augmentation, providing a new approach to facial palsy classification.},

The objective of this research is to remove the facial mask on face images using generative adversarial network, or GAN, model. We set up three different training process to explore how to remove a facial mask effectively.

This chapter discusses the milestones achieved in GenAI. It examines its increasingly widespread applications for text and images. The chapter provides an overview of the technology and its evolution and retracing its origins in natural language models, generative adversarial networks, and reinforcement learning. Besides AI models for text, some models are also capable of producing images, based on stable diffusion technology. Tokenization is a common procedure in natural language processing in order to split text into tokens and remove any less useful or confounding information. Generative adversarial networks represent another kind of deep learning technology that can give readers an even stronger illusion that the AI can display creativity.

  volume={36},

  pages={4054-4065},
  abstract={Zero-shot learning casts light on lacking unseen class data by transferring knowledge from seen classes via a joint semantic space. However, the distributions of samples from seen and unseen classes are usually imbalanced. Many zero-shot learning methods fail to obtain satisfactory results in the generalized zero-shot learning task, where seen and unseen classes are all used for the test. Also, irregular structures of some classes may result in inappropriate mapping from visual features space to semantic attribute space. A novel generative mixup networks with semantic graph alignment is proposed in this article to mitigate such problems. To be specific, our model first attempts to synthesize samples conditioned with class-level semantic information as the prototype to recover the class-based feature distribution from the given semantic description. Second, the proposed model explores a mixup mechanism to augment training samples and improve the generalization ability of the model. Third, triplet gradient matching loss is developed to guarantee the class invariance to be more continuous in the latent space, and it can help the discriminator distinguish the real and fake samples. Finally, a similarity graph is constructed from semantic attributes to capture the intrinsic correlations and guides the feature generation process.

  abstract={Recently, the rapid growth of cloud computing has created a vast attack surface for malware threats. The existing Support Vector Machine (SVM) accurately detected malwares although the dynamic nature of cloud environments led to high-dimensional data and class imbalance issues. Hence, this research proposes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to address the class imbalance by creating synthetic malware samples. Initially, the input data is collected and fed into the analysis phase with Cuckoo Sandbox to generate malware behavior report in JavaScript Objective Notation (JSON) format. After that, Trend Micro Locality Sensitive Hashing (TLSH) is employed to measure the similarity among files and then the clustering phase groups the similar files as a cluster according to hash values. Further, the features are extracted from JSON format which contains information on Application Programming Interface (API) calls and their return codes. Then, the optimal features are selected using Chi-square to calculate the statistical independence on each feature and finally, GAN model is used to detect malware in cloud environments. From the results, the proposed GAN achieved better results in terms of accuracy (99.61%) when compared to existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN).},

  abstract={Generating image and video is a hot topic in Deep Learning. Especially, generating video is a difficult but meaningful work. How to generate video which has diversity and plausibility is still a problem to be solved. In this paper, we propose a novel model of Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) which called FDGAN to generate clear contour lines. Unlike existing GAN that only use frames, our method extends to use inter-frame difference. First introduce two temporal difference methods to process the inter-frame. Then increase a frame difference discriminator to discriminate whether the inter-frame is true or not. Using the model and new structure proposed, we perform video generation experiments on several widely used benchmark datasets such as MOVING MNIST, UCF-101. Consequently, the results achieve state-of-the-art performance for clarifying contour lines. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations were made to show the effectiveness of our methods.},

  abstract={This research aimed to create and evaluate a hedonic motivation model to comprehend elderly citizens’ acceptance of generative artificial intelligence. The age-related cognitive ability traits and perceived boredom of the elderly were added to the earlier technology acceptance model in the proposed hedonic motivation and flow model. The theoretical model was empirically evaluated using survey questionnaire data of 314 respondents over 55 years. The result showed that cognitive ability significantly impacted perceived ease-of-use, impacting all five hedonic variables. Flow experience was impacted by curiosity and joy but not by control. It was also found that perceived usefulness did not impact usage, while boredom and flow experience impacted usage of GAI-assisted personalized elderly care. The study stated implications for theory and practice before concluding with future research directions.},

  abstract={Nowadays, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is increasingly making inroads in Data Centers, helping to improve aspects related to latency and high speed. Data center-level network infrastructures require managing large volumes of data using high-speed protocols such as InfiniBand, as it allows low latency and parallel processing, as well as various applied switches at different network architecture levels. In this article, we examine those protocols at the data communication level that GenAI uses to optimize and guarantee data flow between nodes, as well as the design and reference of network architectures in the field of GenIA. On the other hand, the components of the GenAI networks used are analyzed. Similarly, a case study is proposed where the performance of the Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) is analyzed based on the definition of a series of metrics such as memory access, memory bandwidth, throughput, energy consumption, temperature, and clock speed, and that through the simulation of neural networks specifically using the Radial Basic Function (RBF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) algorithms, it helps to understand and analyze to what extent these metrics behave and generate possible solutions in the field of data centers.},

  abstract={Autonomous systems are making their way to the market. The transition from tasks performed by humans to tasks performed by machines begs for an answer to one of the most challenging questions in this area of research: Will humans understand and trust what a machine does? Analyzing human and machine behaviors offers the foundational steps toward finding answers to this question. This paper contributes a novel methodology for transforming low-level actions by each agent into high-level categorization of strategies to contrast the behaviors of humans and machines using a computational red teaming environment with a red (evader) and a blue (pursuer) agent. Two orthogonal sources of uncertainty were examined: the uncertainty in the blue agent's situation awareness about the red, and the red agent's uncertainty resulting from deceptive actions by the blue. For each uncertainty source, two different experiments were conducted by varying the controller of the red agent. In one experiment, the red agent was controlled by one of the 34 human subjects; and in the second, by an evolved neural network. The blue agent was controlled by a scripted rule-based system. In this time-critical task, the results revealed that humans tend to follow systemic and consistent strategies, sometimes ignoring the information available to them. On the other hand, machines tend to evolve more complex and diverse strategies. This finding calls for new computational intelligence techniques to enable the fusion of these different strategies into forms that each party can understand and use effectively.},

  abstract={Explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) is a rapidly growing field that focuses on making deep learning models interpretable and understandable to human decision-makers. In this study, we introduce xAAEnet, a novel xAI model applied to the assessment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) severity. OSA is a prevalent sleep disorder that can lead to numerous medical conditions and is currently assessed using the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI). However, AHI has been criticized for its inability to accurately estimate the effect of OSAs on related medical conditions. To address this issue, we propose a human-centric xAI approach that emphasizes similarity between apneic events as a whole and reduces subjectivity in diagnosis by examining how the model makes its decisions. Our model was trained and tested on a dataset of 60 patients’ Polysomnographic (PSG) recordings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model, xAAEnet, outperforms models with traditional architectures such as convolutional regressor, autoencoder (AE), and variational autoencoder (VAE). This study highlights the potential of xAI in providing an objective OSA severity scoring method.Clinical relevance— This study provides an objective OSA severity scoring technique which could improve the management of apneic patients in clinical practice.},

This manuscript proposes a framework for enhancing AI-assistive technology through personalization enabled by generative AI. Namely, emerging generative models are fine-tuned using training data mined from text, audio, and visual records of target individuals to produce customized user experiences which can be integrated within the technology ecosystem available to the end-user.

  abstract={Text-to-image synthesis is the task of synthesizing realistic and text-matching images according to given text descriptions. Most text-to-image generative networks consist of two modules: a pre-trained text-image encoder and a text-to-image generative adversarial network. In this paper, we propose a stronger text encoder which employs a text Transformer to extract semantically meaningful parts from text descriptions. With the stronger text encoder, the generator can obtain more meaningful text information to synthesize realistic and text-matching images. In addition, we propose a Dynamic Convolutional text-image Fusion Generative Adversarial Network (DCFGAN) which employs the Dynamic Convolutional Fusion Block to fuse text and image features efficiently. The Dynamic Convolutional Fusion block adjusts the parameters in the convolution layer according to different text descriptions to synthesize text-matching images. It improves the efficiency of fusing text features and image features in generator network. We evaluate the proposed DCF-GAN on two benchmark datasets, the CUB and the Oxford-102. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed stronger text encoder and Dynamic Convolutional Fusion Layer can greatly promote the performance of text-to-image synthesis.},

  abstract={In edge computing environment, dynamic offloading complex tasks is a key issue that affects the overall system performance and user experience. In cloud-edge-end collaborative systems, efficiently offloading tasks with dependencies and data sensitivity, while maximizing resource allocation and quality of service, is a challenging problem for edge service providers.To address this, we propose an optimization method based on the Generative Adversarial Q Network (GAQN).By incorporating Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), we enhance Q-value estimation, improving the accuracy and stability of the policy. Specifically, we model complex task offloading in edge computing as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Then,We design and implement GAQN, combining a generative adversarial network with a dueling deep Q network (Dueling DQN) to optimize task scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that GAQN exhibits good stability and convergence with proper training, yielding optimal Q values. In terms of service quality, GAQN effectively reduces total system delay and energy consumption. Additionally, GAQN adapts to different network environments and efficiently handles task dependencies and data sensitivity, ensuring data privacy and smooth task execution.},

  abstract={Recognizing prohibited items in X-ray security checking images automatically based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has attracted attention increasingly. However, there are no suitable X-ray security checking image databases to train a reliable CNN model. Therefore, we propose a data augmentation method for X-ray security checking images. First, a lot of new X-ray prohibited item images are generated using the improved Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN). Next, a Cycle GAN based method is proposed to transform the item natural images into the X-ray images. It can enrich the diversity of the new images, including item shape and pose. Then, we combine the prohibited item images with background images to synthesize the new X-ray security checking images. Finally, two single shot multi-box detector (SSD) models are applied to verify whether the enlarged database has achieved data augmentation. Experimental results show that the performance of SSD model trained by the enlarged database is better than the SSD model trained by the original database. It implies that our method can achieve data augmentation for X-ray security checking images effectively.},
