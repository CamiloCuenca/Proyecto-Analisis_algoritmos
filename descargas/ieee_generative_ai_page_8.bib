  abstract={With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), its application in educational settings has increasingly become a focal point, particularly in enhancing students’ analytical capabilities. This study examines the effectiveness of the ChatGPT prompt framework in improving text analysis skills among students, specifically targeting readability, accuracy, completeness, logicality, and critical thinking. Conducted among high school students in Canada, the research assesses how GAI prompt frameworks significantly affect the quality of students’ analytical responses. Results showed significant improvements in all five aspects of readability, accuracy, completeness, logicality, and critical thinking, especially for students with no prior knowledge of the topic. However, enhancements in completeness and critical thinking were less pronounced, suggesting that while the ChatGPT framework substantially supports basic analytical skills, its effectiveness varies depending on the complexity of cognitive tasks and the extent of students’ existing knowledge. The study underscores the significant role that advanced GAI tools can play in modern educational environments, promoting deeper engagement with learning materials and enhancing students’ analytical abilities. It highlights the necessity of integrating these technologies to cater to diverse learning needs and cognitive challenges.},

  abstract={Generative AI is a new and rapidly developing field of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new data or content. Although the concept of generating content was invented long back, the latest breakthroughs in neural network architectures have made it possible to implement this concept at a much faster pace. With the availability of vast amounts of data and computational power, it has become increasingly feasible. Generative models aim to generate new data resembling the training data distribution by learning its underlying patterns. They capture the inherent complexity of the data to produce outputs similar to the training examples. Discriminative models, on the other hand, focus on learning boundaries between different classes or categories within the data. The maritime industry is a major contributor to the global economy, but it is also a high-risk industry, as it is exposed to a variety of hazards. Generative AI can be used to improve maritime safety and efficiency in several ways. Although the maritime industry is still in the early stages of adopting generative AI, the potential benefits are significant. The integration of generative AI into maritime operations plays an increasingly important role in the maritime industry. In this view, this paper discusses generative AI, its technology, various applications, and key challenges and research prospectives.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-9},
  abstract={Web Scraping involves the use of bots for the purpose of extracting data from the online web. To extract such data, the web scraper must conduct at least 3 different steps, i.e., collect the necessary links from the web, extract data using the provided links, and save the information in a neatly organized CSV file or database. However, traditional methods to accomplish these steps have faced many difficulties, such as anti-scraping measures and website changes. To tackle these difficulties and to accomplish the steps in a more rapid yet advanced way, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be utilized. As of mid-2024, the rapid development and improvement of AI has resulted in its integration into many businesses and educational institutions. The current state of AI is remarkably advanced that it can be integrated in about any field and sector available. In this paper, the researcher defined the term Web Scraping, Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning, explained the use of AI in Web Scraping including its importance and potential, and the understanding of ethical web scraping practices. This literature review indicated that the integrated use of AI improves the performance of Web Scraping compared to traditional methods.},

  abstract={In the evolving landscape of educational technology, integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into educational assessment creation has emerged as a key area of innovation. This paper compares three methods for generating Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs): (1) without the use of generative AI, (2) with unguided usage of ChatGPT, and (3) with a specialized AI-powered micro-app designed specifically for MCQ generation. The micro-app, named the "MCQ Generator", allows users to set preferences such as difficulty level, number of distractors, and inclusion of hints/feedback, tailoring the final prompt based on these selections. Our study involves instructional designers creating MCQs for hypothetical courses, with educators then evaluating the quality of these questions using a rubric-based approach. The results reveal that AI-assisted methods significantly enhance the efficiency and quality of MCQ generation compared to non-AI methods. Notably, the micro-app demonstrates potential advantages over ChatGPT, offering a more user-friendly interface and a lower barrier to entry for educators. These findings suggest that while ChatGPT can enhance the MCQ creation process, AI micro-apps may provide more tailored functionalities that further streamline educators’ workflows. This paper presents empirical evidence on the utility of AI in educational content development. By doing so, it contributes to the broader discourse on the transformative potential of AI in educational assessment, with a particular focus on online education. Additionally, it explores methods to increase AI adoption within the field.},

  abstract={The development of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI tools, has significantly transformed higher education. This study examined the key challenges encountered by college lecturers in the AI environment and the practical solutions they offered for these challenges. Seventeen heads of departments or academic units from a teacher education college participated in this study. Data were collected through a video-recorded focus group interview and supplemented reports. Data were analyzed inductively using the constant comparison method to identify recurring themes and patterns across the participants. The findings revealed five central challenges faced by college lecturers: (1) Assessment integrity that includes difficulties in verifying student authenticity, increasing plagiarism risks, and diminishing academic originality; (2) AI adoption resistance characterized by reluctance or hesitancy in embracing AI technologies stemming from limited familiarity and a lack of confidence; (3) Pedagogical adaptation imperative that necessitates the revision of instructional methodologies and a redefinition of the lecturer's role in the context of AI integration; (4) Technological literacy disparities that refer to gaps in digital literacy among both faculty and students, compound by unequal familiarity with AI tools; and (5) Limited institutional resources that result in restricted access to advanced AI tools and insufficient professional development opportunities. In response to these challenges, the participants proposed several potential solutions: fostering transparent and ethical student utilization of AI tools, implementing alternative assessment strategies focused on personal and critical thinking skills, enhancing institutional support through ICT centers, offering structured training programs, and ensuring equitable access to AI platforms. So, colleges need to open dialogue and collaboration among faculty members to develop shared guidelines and best practices for the ethical and effective use of AI in academic settings. In addition, teaching should focus more on thinking critically and personal skills, which are especially essential in the AI environment.},

  abstract={Summary <p>The best datasets have the perfect combination of quantity and quality, as well as enough diversity to be fully representative of the different types of patients that the algorithm will be used for. Obtaining high&#x2010;quality data for the training and validation of Artificial intelligence (AI) models is challenging. If the people want to aggregate data from different sources so that they can train and use AI algorithms in healthcare, data standardization will be critical. Federated learning is an up&#x2010;and&#x2010;coming approach to AI training that aims to protect the privacy of sensitive user data by ensuring that it never leaves their device. Art generated by generative AI can be impossible to distinguish from a painting by humans. Synthetic data is one way of dealing with the issue of creating datasets for algorithm training.</p>},

  abstract={This paper proposes an adversarial hash cross-modal retrieval method based on a multimodal interactive attention mechanism. By constructing a cross-modal shared subspace representation learning network KGRU, the global semantic and local semantic information of each modality is extracted, and then introduce the attention mechanism into the model to further capture the key local feature information in different modalities. The experimental results show that this method can accurately mine the structural information and semantic correlation between modalities, and improve the accuracy of cross-modal retrieval. Improve computing time efficiency. The state-of-the-art effect is obtained in cross-modal retrieval experiments on the NUS-WIDE dataset.},

  abstract={The increasing use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools in learning contexts calls for a reassessment of the complex dynamics surrounding academic integrity. It is a “hot” topic in the academic community, given that these more generative AI tools have become available to students to complete student assignments, and universities have had to urgently adopt rules on their use for academic purposes. While some universities have completely banned the use of such programs for the purpose of writing assignments and essays because they believe that this violates academic integrity, some other universities believe that they have the potential to influence the way we learn and approach education and that generative AI tools they must use for the benefit of students and faculty staff. The aim of the study conducted at the universities of Vern and Algebra in Zagreb, in the winter semester academic year 2023/2024 was to investigate whether students use generative AI tools for writing assignments and academic papers, how they perceive academic integrity in relation to the use of generative AI tools, and the advantages and disadvantages of generative artificial intelligence tools.},

  abstract={Summary <p>There are two broad classes in AI: generative AI and discriminative AI. Machine learning (ML), a part of AI, learns from data. Deep learning (DL), a deeper part of ML, uses layered setups to solve tougher problems. Discriminative AI focuses on algorithms that learn to tell apart different data classes. Looking at existing applications, discriminative AI generally has five main tasks: classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and reinforcement learning. Generative AI has the ability to generate all kinds of data and content. By learning the patterns and characteristics of given datasets, generative AI models can create new data samples that are similar to the original data. Generally speaking, generative AI models can perform three tasks: data generation, data transformation, and data enrichment. Large language models are at the forefront of generative AI applications, with widespread impacts across various industries.</p>},

  title={A color style fusion design method based on generative adversarial networks}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={338-343},
  abstract={Fusion design is an innovative design approach in product color design. The fusion design makes the color matching richer. It not only can be simultaneously with a variety of styles but also fully express the design concept. However, the manual completion of the fusion design process takes time and effort. With the development of artificial intelligence, some designers apply intelligent algorithms to fusion design and significantly improve design efficiency. However, most design methods only achieve style migration from the source domain product style to the target domain product in one direction, leading to the resulting design solution losing some of the style information of the target domain product. We propose a color-style fusion design method based on generative adversarial networks. Take the eyeshadow color design as an example. Firstly, the source domain art painting dataset and the target domain eyeshadow dataset are collected, and the CycleGAN extracts the color styles of both to fuse to generate an eyeshadow color scheme with artistic style. The experimental results show that the proposed method can meet the color design concept of color cosmetics and retain the original art painting color style, providing a reference for designers and a new idea for product fusion design.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-17},
  abstract={Recent advances in diffusion models have opened new avenues for research into embodied AI agents and robotics. Despite significant achievements in complex robotic locomotion and skills, mobile manipulation–a capability that requires the coordination of navigation and manipulation–remains a challenge for generative AI techniques. This is primarily due to the high-dimensional action space, extended motion trajectories, and interactions with the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce M2 Diffuser, a diffusion-based, scene-conditioned generative model that directly generates coordinated and efficient whole-body motion trajectories for mobile manipulation based on robot-centric 3D scans. M2 Diffuser first learns trajectory-level distributions from mobile manipulation trajectories provided by an expert planner. Crucially, it incorporates an optimization module that can flexibly accommodate physical constraints and task objectives, modeled as cost and energy functions, during the inference process. This enables the reduction of physical violations and execution errors at each denoising step in a fully differentiable manner. Through benchmarking on three types of mobile manipulation tasks across over 20 scenes, we demonstrate that M2 Diffuser outperforms state-of-the-art neural planners and successfully transfers the generated trajectories to a real-world robot. Our evaluations underscore the potential of generative AI to enhance the generalization of traditional planning and learning-based robotic methods, while also highlighting the critical role of enforcing physical constraints for safe and robust execution.

  abstract={This study investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated personalized images to address the underrepresentation of female students in university engineering programs and promote gender equality in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). Persistent gender disparities in STEM present significant barriers to diversity and innovation, highlighting the need for innovative strategies to inspire underrepresented groups. The research involved 76 high school students from scientific tracks, who were shown with AI-generated personalized images portraying themselves working in STEM-related professions. Results indicate that self-envisioning in STEM fields increased for both genders after the intervention, with the effect being four times greater for female students. In engineering fields specifically, a significant increase in selfenvisioning was observed among female students, while no significant impact was found for male students-likely due to the historical underrepresentation of women and the influence of gender stereotypes on career aspirations. These findings demonstrate the potential of AI-generated personalized images as a novel tool to reduce gender disparities in STEM. Integrating such an approach into career counseling could enhance participation and foster diversity in STEM disciplines.},

Specifically, we investigate three distinct models from the Gretel platform: Tabular&#x2010;ACTGAN, Tabular&#x2010;Differential&#x2010;Privacy, and Tabular&#x2010;LSTM, each tailored to address different aspects of tabular data synthesis with a focus on healthcare data. Tabular&#x2010;ACTGAN excels in generating numerical data with high column counts and unique categorical fields, offering conditional data generation capabilities. Tabular&#x2010;Differential&#x2010;Privacy provides strong differential privacy guarantees, making it ideal for datasets with categorical variables and ensuring individual privacy in the generated data. Tabular&#x2010;LSTM supports a wide range of data types and introduces automatic data semantic validation to ensure the fidelity and utility of the synthetic data. This study finds that Tabular&#x2010;Differential&#x2010;Privacy outperforms other two models scoring 6 out of 10. It also outshines others by scoring 92% in the synthetic data quality score. Tabular&#x2010;ACTGAN is best when measured against principal component stability, scoring 100%. Tabular&#x2010;LTSM scores 91% for field correlation stability.</p>},

  abstract={The rapid convergence of generative AI (GAI), neuro-symbolic reasoning, and quantum computing has redefined secure communication and networking. Owing to the massive amounts of data, the need for extensive computing power, and the necessity to find and mitigate threats in real-time, traditional security measures cannot keep up with changing cyber threats as the communication infrastructure becomes more complicated. Therefore, this paper investigates the potential of a GAI-enhanced neuro-symbolic quantum framework for building security systems that are strong, scalable, and self-sufficient. This method improves threat detection, encryption, and real-time adversarial defense by combining symbolic reasoning for logic, deep learning for pattern recognition, and quantum intelligence to accelerate computations.

This paper presents CAS-GAN, a novel GAN framework that serves as a “virtual contrast agent” to synthesize X-ray angiographies via disentanglement representation learning and vessel semantic guidance, thereby reducing the reliance on iodinated contrast agents during interventional procedures. Specifically, our approach disentangles X-ray angiographies into background and vessel components, leveraging medical prior knowledge. A specialized predictor then learns to map the interrelationships between these components. Additionally, a vessel semantic-guided generator and a corresponding loss function are introduced to enhance the visual fidelity of generated images. Experimental results on the XCAD dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our CAS-GAN, achieving a FID of 5.87 and a MMD of 0.016.

  abstract={The motivation of this paper is to be able to generate high-quality (Structured Query Language) SQL language sentences in terms of syntax and semantics so that they are intended to achieve a concrete predefined and well-known aim. For example, generating SQL sentences that are capable of detecting a cyber-attack from a set of metrics available in a database table. Two solutions are needed to achieve so, a tool that enables and performs the syntactically valid generation of SQL sentences and an (Artificial intelligence) AI algorithm able to guide the semantics of such generations to the achievement of the best sentences for the intended purpose. The main contribution of this manuscript is the first of these solutions. To be concrete, this paper proposes a tool to enable and generate syntactic-valid language sentences. The tool can deal with any language defined as an ANTLR4 EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form) grammar. The paper also provides a methodology to help achieve an EBNF grammar suitable for addressing concerns related to ambiguity and recursion as a direct result of the generation process. The paper further implements a prototype utilizing ANTLR4’s recognizer and its Augmented Transition Network for language generation using EBNF grammars. In-depth design and logic implementation are provided, showcasing areas of interest for AI integration. The achieved prototype showed an ability to easily generate syntactically valid SQL statements at various depths, with observable problems becoming more apparent during the exponential recursive growth. Our mitigation controls for such scenarios proved to be successful and were able to complete the recursion whilst also moving the push-down automata forward until query completion. Experimental validation was performed against a SQL EBNF grammar feeding the generated SQL statement into an SQL parser to validate the syntax.},

  abstract={In Recent years, Representation learning as one of the information extraction and data mapping methods in machine learning systems has received huge attention. Artificial deep neural networks are considered as one of the basic structures capable of representation learning. However, a large number of standard representation learning methods are supervised and requires a lot of labeled data. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised representation learning by designing and implementing deep neural networks (DNNs) in combination with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The main idea behind the proposed method, which causes the superiority of this method over others is representation learning via the generative models and encoder networks altogether. In this research, encoders are utilized in addition to the generative models to help the more features to be extracted. It is shown that the proposed method not only help feature extraction but accelerate and improve the performance of the learning in GANs which lead to better feature extraction. The results confirm the superiority of the proposed approach regarding classification accuracy by 2% to 6% improvement over other unsupervised feature learning methods.},

  abstract={The purpose of this research paper is to investigate the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) tools into Australian higher education. This study will emphasise the advantages, disadvantages, and ethical repercussions of adopting an "AI-first mindset." This mindset delves into students and faculty, encouraging the use of AI tools for academic research, assessments, and support in educational settings. With the rising use of AI technology by educational institutions to improve learning outcomes, providing personalised student experience and streamline administrative procedures. It is becoming increasingly important to evaluate both the potential benefits and the inherent problems associated with the advent of AI. This research adopts a mixed-methods approach, with quantitative surveys of educators and students used along with qualitative interviews from other stakeholders in the tech industry. The research findings indicate that even though AI tools can improve engagement and efficiency, issues around data privacy, the digital gap, and the possibility of AI bias exist in algorithms. A critical analysis is also performed on the ethical considerations surrounding academic integrity and educators' role in an environment enhanced by artificial intelligence. At the end of the article, recommendations are made for legislative frameworks and best practices that will lead to the appropriate integration of artificial intelligence in higher education. These recommendations will ensure that the advantages are maximised while mitigating the dangers connected with the integration. This research contributes to the changing environment of higher education in the digital era and gives insights to institutions striving to create an ethical and inclusive approach to AI deployment.},

  abstract={We are in a golden age of progress in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Radiotherapy is perfectly suited to benefit from AI to enhance accuracy and efficiency due to its technology-intensive nature and direct human–machine interactions. While large amount of AI research have recently been published in the field of photon therapy, applications of AI specifically targeted for particle therapy remain scarcely investigated. There are two distinct differences between the photon therapy and particle therapy: 1) beam interaction physics (photons versus charged particles) and 2) beam delivery mode (e.g., IMRT/VMAT versus pencil beam scanning). Consequently, different strategies of AI deployment are required for these two radiotherapy modalities. In this article, we aim to present a comprehensive survey of recent literature exclusively focusing on AI-powered particle therapy. Six major aspects are included: 1) treatment planning; 2) dose calculation; 3) range and dose verification; 4) image guidance; 5) quality assurance; and 6) adaptive replanning. A number of perspectives, as well as potential challenges and common pitfalls, are also discussed.},

  abstract={Text-to-Image Synthesis has gained significant attention due to its ability to generate realistic visuals from textual descriptions. Existing methods, such as Attention-based GAN s and Transformer models, often face challenges in maintaining semantic alignment between text and images, handling complex textual inputs, and ensuring high-quality outputs. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DC-GAN) framework leveraging GloVe embeddings for semantic representation. The Oxford 102 Flower dataset, comprising image-text pairs, is used to train and evaluate the model. The DC-GAN architecture includes a generator to synthesize images and a discriminator to validate authenticity, enabling iterative improvement. Evaluation metrics show an average Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) score of 0.286 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 1.455, demonstrating semantic coherence and low pixel-level deviations. Challenges such as refining fine-grained image details and enhancing robustness across diverse datasets persist. This study highlights the potential of DC-GAN for multimodal AI applications, including targeted advertising, virtual reality, and creative design. By advancing text-to-image synthesis, the research provides a robust framework for future exploration in generating semantically consistent and high-quality visuals from text.},

  abstract={The past few years have experienced significant strides in the development of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in high-quality image generation. This paper provides a detailed review about the most prominent GAN models that have shaped the development of more realistic synthetic images. The aim of this paper is to help researchers review the most significant advancements and gain insights regarding their basics, working, limitations and future scope. The major driving force for the rapid development of GANs is the extensive work done to solve training instability, mode collapse, and visual artifact issues. These issues make training a GAN a difficult process. To address this concern, we chose six pioneering models for in-depth analysis—StyleGAN, StyleGAN-XL, StarGAN, Slicing Adversarial Network (SAN), Diffusion GAN, GigaGAN. These models shattered previous record FID scores and results in unprecedented image generation performance, fundamentally shifting the benchmark of excellence in the field. They have shown to leverage new architectures that advance the state of generative AI. We emphasize their performance regarding the accuracy, variance, and realism of images, as well as the potential impact of these technologies on diverse fields from medical imaging to deepfake detection, object recognition, image editing, and material science. We extend our review by providing a model idea that could help generate finer emotion conditioned images inspired by StarGAN-XL and StyleGAN architecture.},

Deep learning is an intelligent machine’s way in which machines learn without being supervised by us and grants them the power to recognize speech, translate, and even make or take data-driven decisions. Machines consider this as a studying method, inspired by the architecture of the human brain and how we learn.

This paper explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize color restoration in historical artworks. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), AI systems can analyze faded paintings and reconstruct their original hues with unprecedented precision. Using large datasets of high-resolution images, these algorithms learn patterns of pigment degradation and stylistic nuances inherent to specific artists or periods. The study highlights how AI models, trained on multispectral and hyperspectral imaging data, can infer the original color schemes by detecting remnants of pigments invisible to the naked eye. Moreover, AI-driven simulations offer insights into artistic intent and historical contexts, enabling restorers to make informed decisions. This interdisciplinary approach merges art history, chemistry, and computer science, fostering a new era of cultural heritage preservation. The findings underscore AI's transformative role in safeguarding the visual integrity of humanity's artistic legacy while maintaining the ethical considerations of artistic authenticity and conservation standards.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning approach, named GARL (Generative Adversarial Reinforcement Learning), for intra-day optimization dispatch in high-proportion new energy grid. The proposed method embeds a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) within the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) framework to learn the reward distribution of the power grid in the future operation situation, so as to realize the cumulative reward prediction in the dispatching period and ensure the optimization of the dispatching decision. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the SG-126 power grid simulator under three representative scenarios to evaluate the performance and generalization capability of GARL. The results show that GARL can learn the distribution characteristics of stateaction-reward sequence from historical experience, establish the mapping relationship between current state and future cumulative reward, and improve the accuracy of future power grid operation trend prediction, which is always better than the independent DDPG algorithm. Furthermore, the study explores the potential of transfer learning between scenarios and finds that GARL exhibits a promising generalization capability.},

  pages={18366-18385},
  abstract={This study investigates factors influencing the acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) in education, focusing on attitudes and intentions toward its use. Drawing on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Social Support Theory (SST), the research examines perceived usefulness, ease of use, and support measures, including educational and emotional support. The study was conducted at King Saud University, where it adopted a quantitative approach, collecting data from 350 participants through a structured survey. A final sample of 308 valid responses was analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The findings revealed significant relationships between key constructs: perceived educational support positively influenced perceived usefulness ( $\beta = 0.160$ , p = 0.000) and attitudes toward AI ( $\beta = 0.140$ , p = 0.010). Perceived usefulness ( $\beta = 0.670$ , p = 0.000) and ease of use ( $\beta = 0.330$ , p = 0.000) were strong predictors of positive attitudes, which, in turn, significantly shaped intentions to use AI ( $\beta = 0.760$ , p = 0.000). Emotional support and cognitive support also had notable but mixed effects on perceived usefulness. However, social interaction support and perceived enjoyment did not demonstrate significant influence. These findings highlight the importance of designing AI systems that emphasise usability and provide robust educational and emotional support to enhance acceptance. The study contributes to theory by extending TAM with constructs from SST, offering new insights into AI adoption in academic contexts. Practically, the results guide policymakers and developers in fostering AI acceptance by addressing educational and emotional needs, ensuring effective implementation in higher education.},

  title={The Responsible Development of Automated Student Feedback with Generative AI}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-10},
  abstract={Providing rich, constructive feedback to students is essential for supporting and enhancing their learning. Recent advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly with large language models (LLMs), present new opportunities to deliver scalable, repeatable, and instant feedback, effectively making abundant a resource that has historically been scarce and costly. From a technical perspective, this approach is now feasible due to breakthroughs in AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP). While the potential educational benefits are compelling, implementing these technologies also introduces a host of ethical considerations that must be thoughtfully addressed. One of the core advantages of AI systems is their ability to automate routine and mundane tasks, potentially freeing up human educators for more nuanced work. However, the ease of automation risks a “tyranny of the majority”, where the diverse needs of minority or unique learners are overlooked, as they may be harder to systematize and less straightforward to accommodate. Ensuring inclusivity and equity in AI-generated feedback, therefore, becomes a critical aspect of responsible AI implementation in education. The process of developing machine learning models that produce valuable, personalized, and authentic feedback also requires significant input from human domain experts. Decisions around whose expertise is incorporated, how it is captured, and when it is applied have profound implications for the relevance and quality of the resulting feedback. Additionally, the maintenance and continuous refinement of these models are necessary to adapt feedback to evolving contextual, theoretical, and student-related factors. Without ongoing adaptation, feedback risks becoming obsolete or mismatched with the current needs of diverse student populations. Addressing these challenges is essential not only for ethical integrity but also for building the operational trust needed to integrate AI-driven systems as valuable tools in contemporary education. Thoughtful planning and deliberate choices are needed to ensure that these solutions truly benefit all students, allowing AI to support an inclusive and dynamic learning environment.},

  pages={167-172},
  abstract={Data augmentation is a widespread innovative technique in Artificial Intelligence: it aims at creating new synthetic data given an existing real baseline, thus allowing to overcome the issues arising from the lack of labelled data for proper training of classification algorithms. Our paper focuses on how a common data augmentation methodology, the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which is widespread for images and timeseries data, can be also applied to generate multivariate data. We propose a novel scheme for GANs evaluation, based on the performance of an explainable AI (XAI) algorithm and an innovative definition of rule similarity. In particular, we will consider an application dealing with the augmentation of Inertial Movement Units (IMU) data for physical fatigue monitoring in two age subgroups (under and over 40 years old) of the original data. We will show how our innovative rule similarity metric can drive the selection of the best fake dataset among a set of different candidates, corresponding to different GAN training runs.},

  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks or GANS, are another way of achieving generative modeling using various deep learning methods like convoluted neural networks. They have a wide range of applications like :- image to image translation, improving the resolution of the images, creating multiple images using a single image, checking if the image is real or fake and the list goes on. One of the implementations of GANS, i.e, DCGANS would be discussed in this paper. DCGANS stands for Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks, it uses convolutional and convolutional-transpose layers in the generator and discriminator, respectively. This DCGANS give prompt result while processing many real time images. In their study Unsupervised representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks, Radford et al. proposed it. This algorithm generates fake images after being trained on a dataset of human faces. However to create these fake images, the quality of these images should be compromised and this can also make them easily identifiable as fake image. So, here StyleGANS will be used as another implementation of GANS. StyleGANS is not only used for improving the quality of these images but also it helps us to increase fakeness of the images. This project uses the CelebA dataset from Kaggle to train the models.},

  abstract={This paper discusses securities and cryptocurrency trading using artificial intelligence (AI) in the sense that it focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on selected technical indicators before proceeding to modelling, and then to develop more practical models by introducing new reward loss function that maximizes the returns during training phase. The results of EDA reveal that the complex patterns within the data can be better captured by discriminative classification models and this was endorsed by performing back-testing on two securities using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forests (RF) as discriminative models against their counterpart Naïve Bayes as a generative model. To enhance the learning process, the new reward loss function is utilized to retrain the ANN with testing on AAPL, IBM, BRENT CRUDE and BTC using auto-trading strategy that serves as the intelligent unit, and the results indicate this loss superiorly outperforms the conventional cross-entropy used in predictive models. The overall results of this work suggest that there should be larger focus on EDA and more practical losses in the research of machine learning modelling for stock market prediction applications.},

  abstract={A microgrid can be formed by the integration of different components such as loads, renewable/conventional units, and energy storage systems in a local area. Microgrids with the advantages of being flexible, environmentally friendly, and self-sufficient can improve the power system performance metrics such as resiliency and reliability. However, the design and implementation of microgrids are always faced with different challenges considering the uncertainties associated with loads and renewable energy resources, sudden load variations, energy management of several energy resources, etc. Therefore, it is required to employ such rapid and accurate methods, as artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, to address these challenges and improve the MG's efficiency, stability, security, and reliability. Utilization of AI helps to develop systems as intelligent as humans to learn, decide, and solve problems. This article presents a review on different applications of AI-based techniques in microgrids such as energy management, load and generation forecasting, protection, power electronics control, and cyber security. Different AI tasks such as regression and classification in microgrids are discussed using methods including machine learning, artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, support vector machines, etc. The advantages, limitation, and future trends of AI applications in microgrids are discussed.},

  pages={14684-14698},
  abstract={Lifelong learning describes an ability that enables humans to continually acquire and learn new information without forgetting. This capability, common to humans and animals, has lately been identified as an essential function for an artificial intelligence system aiming to learn continuously from a stream of data during a certain period of time. However, modern neural networks suffer from degenerated performance when learning multiple domains sequentially and fail to recognize past learned tasks after being retrained. This corresponds to catastrophic forgetting and is ultimately induced by replacing the parameters associated with previously learned tasks with new values. One approach in lifelong learning is the generative replay mechanism (GRM) that trains a powerful generator as the generative replay network, implemented by a variational autoencoder (VAE) or a generative adversarial network (GAN). In this article, we study the forgetting behavior of GRM-based learning systems by developing a new theoretical framework in which the forgetting process is expressed as an increase in the model’s risk during the training. Although many recent attempts have provided high-quality generative replay samples by using GANs, they are limited to mainly downstream tasks due to the lack of inference. Inspired by the theoretical analysis while aiming to address the drawbacks of existing approaches, we propose the lifelong generative adversarial autoencoder (LGAA). LGAA consists of a generative replay network and three inference models, each addressing the inference of a different type of latent variable. The experimental results show that LGAA learns novel visual concepts without forgetting and can be applied to a wide range of downstream tasks.},

Addressing these limitations is essential to enhance the effectiveness of AI-based tools in educational support. The main objective of this paper is to propose a tool-based RAG as automated assistant in an OOP Course. The tool was tested using common student queries and its responses were compared with those generated by ChatGPT. Initial observations suggest that RAG consistently generated contextually relevant responses due to its ability to access pertinent information from a structured knowledge base, resulting in more precise and applicable answers for students.

The research proposes hypotheses that teachers' adoption of Generative Artificial Intelligence in educational instruction is influenced by seven factors: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, visibility, information channels, and teachers' personal innovativeness. Through correlation analysis, it is discovered that these influencing factors are significantly correlated with teachers' adoption and application of Generative Artificial Intelligence in educational instruction. Regression analysis further reveals that compatibility and visibility have significant positive predictive effects on teachers' adoption of Generative Artificial Intelligence.

  abstract={Generative AI assistants are AI-powered applications that can provide personalized responses to user queries or prompts. A variety of AI assistants have recently been released, and among the most popular is OpenAI's ChatGPT. In this work-in-progress in innovative practice, we explore evidence-based learning strategies and the integration of Generative AI for computer science and engineering education. We expect this research will lead to innovative pedagogical approaches to enhance undergraduate computer science and engineering education. In particular, we describe how ChatGPT was used in two computing-based courses: a Junior-level course in database systems and a Senior-level class in mobile application development. We identify four evidence-based learning strategies: well-defined learning goals, authentic learning experiences, structured learning progression, and strategic assessment. We align these strategies with the two aforementioned courses and evaluate the usefulness of ChatGPT specifically in achieving the learning goals. Combining Generative AI with evidence-based learning has the potential to transform modern education into a more personalized learning experience.},

  abstract={Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been effective for learning generative models for real-world data. However, accompanied with the generative tasks becoming more and more challenging, existing GANs (GAN and its variants) tend to suffer from different training problems such as instability and mode collapse. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN framework called evolutionary GANs (E-GANs) for stable GAN training and improved generative performance. Unlike existing GANs, which employ a predefined adversarial objective function alternately training a generator and a discriminator, we evolve a population of generators to play the adversarial game with the discriminator. Different adversarial training objectives are employed as mutation operations and each individual (i.e., generator candidature) are updated based on these mutations. Then, we devise an evaluation mechanism to measure the quality and diversity of generated samples, such that only well-performing generator(s) are preserved and used for further training. In this way, E-GAN overcomes the limitations of an individual adversarial training objective and always preserves the well-performing offspring, contributing to progress in, and the success of GANs. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that E-GAN achieves convincing generative performance and reduces the training problems inherent in existing GANs.},

  abstract={Today’s AI technology has various applications in many fields, thus creating opportunities to improve different aspects of daily life and optimize business operations. However, there are also societal expectations and concerns regarding AI and its future impacts. Investigating such societal opinions and feelings is essential for social acceptance, further development and distribution of such technology, regulation, and adaptation to changes and policies. Despite this situation, such an exploration has not been sufficiently conducted in the existing literature and the most appropriate methods for such an exploration have not been sufficiently investigated. To contribute to addressing this limitation in literature, this study applies topic modeling and sentiment analysis approaches to investigate societal opinions and feelings about the future of AI on social media, which includes conversations from various segments of society. A corpus consisting of 16,611 comments and 998 unique Reddit post titles was analyzed with a customized BERTopic model for topic modeling and a BERT sentiment classification model. This study highlights the significant advantages of using BERTopic and BERT models in analyzing a large sample of social media discussions. The results of this study can help realize the potential of text analytics methods through transformer-based language models to derive empirical findings from large-scale data samples.},

  abstract={Increasing prevalence and simplicity of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, Steganography is shifting from conventional model building to AI model building. AI enables computers to learn from their mistakes, adapt to emerging inputs, and carry out human-like activities. Traditional Linguistic Steganographic approaches lack automation, analysis of Cover text and hidden text volume and accuracy. A formal methodology is used in only a few Steganographic approaches. In the vast majority of situations, traditional approaches fail to survive third-party vulnerability. This study looks at evaluation of an AI-based statistical language model for text Steganography. Since the advent of Natural Language Processing (NLP) into the research field, linguistic Steganography has superseded other types of Steganography. This paper proposes the positive aspects of NLP-based Markov chain model for an auto-generative cover text. The embedding rate, volume, and other attributes of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) Steganographic schemes are contrasted in this article between RNN-Stega and RNN-generated Lyrics, two RNN methods. Here the RNN model follows Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The paper also includes a case study on Artificial Intelligence and Information Security, which discusses history, applications, AI challenges, and how AI can help with security threats and vulnerabilities. The final portion is dedicated to the study’s shortcomings, which may be the subject of future research.},

  abstract={Medical reconstruction of images is essential for deep learning model training, improving diagnosis efficiency, and augmenting small datasets for a range medical purpose. In this work, we investigate the synthesis of realistic and superior chest X-ray pictures using Deep Convolutional neural networks Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN). A vital diagnosing technique for breathing problems disorders is chest X-ray imaging, and the development and assessment of AI-based medical devices can benefit from a greater amount of numerous, artificially produced information. We offer a novel method that creates synthetic chest Xray pictures that closely replicate real radiography data by utilizing DCGAN, a generative model architecture. Our solution is based on a two-step process: a discriminator network and a generator. The discriminator discerns among real and fake pictures, while a generator trains to produce accurate images of the chest. Through an intensive training regimen, these two networks continuously enhance the standard of the pictures they produce. We ran comprehensive tests on a variety of chest X-ray image datasets to confirm the efficacy of our methodology. Our DCGAN model produced artificial pictures that bore striking visual similarities to actual X-ray images of the chest, including radiographic noise, disease patterns, and anatomical features. In order to statistically evaluate the diversity and realism of the created photos, we also used a variety of assessment measures, which we used to show that our model created extremely convincing synthetic data. The synthesised chest X-ray pictures might be useful assets for expanding on small datasets, which will help build strong and precise deep-learning algorithms for the detection and classifications of pulmonary diseases. These pictures may also be utilized to improve computer-aided diagnosis system training and validation, which will help medical personnel make better judgements and provide better treatment for patients.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a novel framework that melds the profound tenets of Indian philosophy with AI and ML. Our goal is to create models that replicate human cognition, paving the way for robots that think like us. Key concepts from Indian philosophy, including ”buddhi,” ”manas,” ”chit,” and ”ahamkar,” are woven into the framework, enhancing AI’s ability to understand and interact with the world in a more human-like way. The core of the framework consists of ”Buddhi” and ”Manas.” Buddhi, a discriminative AI component, adeptly navigates sensory data, making decisions aligned with human discernment. Complementing it, ”Manas” is a generative core, capable of crafting narratives and generating creative solutions. This synergy creates an iterative loop that encapsulates human thought, enabling machines to think, visualize, and even dream. In addition to advancing AI and ML research, we conducted an experiment using a modified News Aggregator dataset from the UCI repository. The experiment focused on word prediction, and our model, infused with Indian philosophy, outperformed RNN and LSTM models over 30 epochs. This framework has the potential to revolutionize AI and create more human-like machines, ushering in a new era of AI and robotics.},

  abstract={The design and optimization of high-power nonlinear power amplifiers often requires copious time-consuming measurements. To maximize performance, multiple constraints must be satisfied simultaneously in a complex, high-dimensional search space, resulting in a complex and slow design process. This work validates multidimensional load-pull extrapolation using generative adversarial network image completion as a method for reducing the number of measurements required to characterize a power amplifier over multiple design parameters simultaneously. Using 16 output power measurements of a transistor with different input powers and load impedances, an extrapolated three-dimensional load-pull dataset of 24,192 points can be obtained. The extrapolated data accurately predicts the optimal reflection coefficient over input power within a vector distance of about 0.1 on the Smith Chart, resulting in an achieved mean output power error of under 0.2 dB. This can speed up the high-power nonlinear power amplifier design process and can hasten real-time reconfiguration over multiple parameters.},

In recent years, a large number of network attacks, especially botnet and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks which are difficult to detect, have seriously affected the normal operation of social work. Solutions and methods based on artificial intelligence techniques are therefore proposed to help detect cyberattacks. In this paper, the application of GAN in the field of network security is discussed. GAN has been one of the most significant deep learning models in recent years. It consists of a generative model and a discriminative model which can be combined to produce a dynamic game system. GAN has been applied in various fields such as image generation, speech processing, data enhancement, and cyberattack detection. This paper demonstrates the basic working principle and infrastructure of GAN, and also focuses on how the GAN model assists with cyber intrusion detection.},

  number={},
  pages={96-99},
  abstract={Chronic disease management requires continuous care to prevent exacerbations, yet providing 24/7 accessible medical advice is a significant challenge for care providers. The current model of periodic patient visits with standard dialogue responses fails to adequately address the individualized needs of patients and caregivers. This lack of personalized guidance undermines treatment adherence and satisfaction. To bridge this gap, we developed a novel approach leveraging generative AI (GAI) to optimize patient-manager interactions. Focusing on prevalent chronic conditions such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and dementia, we created intelligent dialogue agents that deliver tailored, actionable nursing recommendations aligning with each case's unique circumstances. The developed methodology began by curating a corpus of 30 frequently asked questions on home care, emotional support, and social factors from online patient data across the three diseases. We employed prompt engineering to precisely define the virtual roles of nurses and physicians while implementing a “Rephrase and Respond” (RAR) protocol to enhance query comprehension and generate reliable solutions. The RAR approach solves problems by question restating, followed by contextualized recommendations from the language model. Clinical expert feedback iteratively refined the system's outputs. The evaluation result showed an average gain of 10% in response and an increase of 5% in readability after optimization. The optimized RAR method of large language models effectively improved the quality of nursing advice for chronic disease, aligned with patients' emotional and social needs. The RAR method in medical advisory areas, including chronic disease management and rehabilitation care, enhances the quality and practicality of nursing advice in these domains.},

  abstract={The process of De Novo drug design involves the integration of artificial intelligence with computational intelligence techniques. The proposed system aims to provide precision therapeutics through the development of targeted chemical libraries designed for individual patient’s needs. They also highlight the potential impact of precision medicine. The traditional approach involves trial and error methods in the combination of various chemicals for desired drug discovery that leads to the waste of time and energy. These challenges are overcome through the aid of artificial intelligence techniques. The interaction of molecules, physiochemical properties, and biological interaction of potential drugs are obtained through the aid of optimization algorithms. With the integration of computational intelligence, the design structure becomes more adaptable. This helps in the formation of chemically diverse compound libraries. The important aspect of the proposed system involves the ability of advanced precision therapeutics. The clinical information is necessary for the identification of molecular targets achieved through the aid of optimization algorithms. These obtained targets are necessary for the development of new drugs with high affinity and specificity. This helps in minimizing the off-target effects which improves the therapeutic efficacy. The novel molecular structure is generated using the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The compound properties are optimized using reinforcement and an iterative learning process. The simpler structure of drug-like molecules is obtained through an evolutionary algorithm.

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-9},
  abstract={This paper explores and evaluates the use of OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o as a feedback tool for engineering drawings. The AI feedback tool was trained on a synthetic dataset specifically created for the task, which included a comprehensive checklist derived from the Australian Standard for Technical Drawings (AS 1100) and a variety of engineering drawing examples. The evaluation involved repeated testing of three distinct case studies, each representing different levels of drawing accuracy. The findings reveal both strengths and weaknesses in the AI feedback tool’s performance, providing valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of AI in providing feedback on engineering drawings in the education context. The research also highlights the need for further training to improve accuracy in certain areas and the potential bias in the evaluation process. A key observation from this study is that while Open AI’s ChatGPT-4o model can generate feedback, it may not truly ‘understand’ the engineering drawings in the same way a human would. This work contributes to the ongoing efforts to leverage AI in education, particularly in the context of engineering drawing feedback, and underscores the importance of human oversight and intervention in the application of AI technology.},

  pages={320-327},
  abstract={This paper addresses the deficiencies in traditional design methods for exhibition spaces, particularly in terms of efficiency, customization, iterative speed, and design cycles. Specifically, it highlights the issues with the emerging digitalized design methods based on Generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI), such as non-standard and unstructured input expressions, high inconsistency in output results, and low repeatability. By utilizing the Knowledge Graph (KG) to achieve accurate semantic representation and orderly contextual association, as well as structured and standardized expression, this study explores and establishes a KG-genAI-based paradigm for the digital and intelligent design of exhibition spaces (KG-genAI-PDIDES). This paradigm drives Midjourney and Stable through unstructured natural language prompting methods for the digital design of UAV exhibition spaces. Comparative analysis of the results demonstrates that the proposed KG-genAI-PDIDES significantly enhances the standardization of input expression and consistency of output results, offering a new design paradigm for the digitization of exhibition spaces.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={0643-0648},
  abstract={Increasing the performance of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) requires experimentation in choosing the suitable training hyper-parameters of learning rate and batch size. There is no consensus on learning rates or batch sizes in GANs, which makes it a "trial-and-error" process to get acceptable output. Researchers have differing views regarding the effect of batch sizes on run time. This paper investigates the impact of these training parameters of GANs with respect to actual elapsed training time. In our initial experiments, we study the effects of batch sizes, learning rates, loss function, and optimization algorithm on training using the MNIST dataset over 30,000 epochs. The simplicity of the MNIST dataset allows for a starting point in initial studies to understand if the parameter changes have any significant impact on the training times. The goal is to analyze and understand the results of varying loss functions, batch sizes, optimizer algorithms, and learning rates on GANs and address the key issue of batch size and learning rate selection.},

  year={2024},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={In this innovative practice Work-In-Progress paper, Generative AI tools were used in a supplemental assignment in a Lean Concepts class. Students were directed to create a summary of a specific topic covered only partially in the regular class material. Students assigned to the same topic then formed four- or five-student groups and reflected on the effectiveness of the AI tools. The accuracy, consistency and usefulness of the AI-created material was considered. Students also reflected on their own learning from the exercise and their possible future use of AI tools. The results, from 78 students, showed that seven different generative AI tools, with a wide range of prompts, gave similar answers. The answers were judged to be useful and accurate; only two instances of the AI being widely off-topic were seen. The answers were rather vague and general; even when prompted for different topics, the AI results had much text in common. All student groups agreed that human interpretation would be needed before the AI-generated material could be used either for presentation or work. They felt the exercise would make it more likely that they will use generative AI tools in the future. The exercise demonstrates both the usefulness and limitations of AI tools for supplemental learning in technical classes. The exercise was easy to run and could be replicated in any introductory or survey class.},

  abstract={The development of large language models (LLM) in generative modeling traces important characteristics through the differed landscapes that are under the effective characteristics through the various emerging technologies. There is a rapid increase in LLM that has attracted numerous researchers, leaders along the public. From a technical perspective, these forms of algorithms always produce content that combines with humanized instructions which aids in creating the instructions and the model structure that completes the assignment patterns. This holds two main processes: the first is where there is an extraction of rules and the generation of the retrieved content. The systems that have been working with rule-based have dominated in generating the model language by facing the issues with system complexity. The models with the computational AI systems have created a greater revolution. It was first developed by creating Gaussian mixture models in the 1950s along with the hidden Markov models. With the use of these models, the sequential data using the speech with the time series approach was developed. This mode of approach develops attraction in the years to come, where the novel methods will be updated regularly, creating life-to-language models.},

  abstract={In the concept of data hiding, image is often used as a cover to hide sensitive data inside it. This approach is considered a good addition in securing information to cryptography which only hides the information and not the presence of the message itself. The combination of Deep Learning with Steganography and Cryptography is rarely done. By utilizing Deep Neural Networks to encrypt and hide the messages, it will be increasingly difficult to decrypt and track.In this study, we developed an encryption mechanism to not only conceal messages, but transforming them into images. The image containing the hidden messages can later be decrypted and converted back into the original message. We use Generative Adversarial Network to develop the encryption and decryption models. Text data is converted into a word vector using word2vec model which then used as input for the encryption model to produce the word images. We use the MNIST dataset to train models which are able to produce images that encrypt 1000 word variations. Based on our experiments, we were able to produce robust encrypted images with 98% accuracy of reversible words. We also show that our model is resistant to various minor image attacks such as scaling, noise addition, and image rotation.},

  abstract={How Artificial Intelligence (AI) supports the performance of traditional firms remains uneven, despite firms having similar access to AI. Using a sample of global publicly quoted companies, we confirm early studies that heterogeneity in firms' ability to scale AI is related to the early orchestration of four AI-specific assets/resources (data, technology infrastructure, AI/data talent, and organisational design). Expanding on early academic work, we uncover four distinct resource-based segments, one of which operates with the full bundle of AI resources and which we call “AI Leaders”. This segment is comprised of the so- called “AI scalers”, i.e. firms for which more than 30% of their costs and revenues are already influenced by AI technologies, as they are able to capitalise on the stock of AI resources invested a few years earlier. We conclude that AI technologies are promising, but the translation of AI investments into significant macroeconomic effects will take time, given that only a small fringe of companies are AI leaders so far and that AI scaling depends on a compounding stock effect. We offer a check list to turbocharge AI scaling based on all the findings in the research.},

  abstract={The swift evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI utilizing deep learning and extensive datasets, has brought substantial benefits across numerous sectors. However, this technological surge simultaneously presents intricate technical hurdles for conventional intellectual property rights protection frameworks. The unprecedented scale, speed, and unique characteristics of AI-generated content significantly strain existing manual and semi-automated IPR management systems. This paper first details the progression and functionalities of pertinent AI technologies. It then examines the pressure these capabilities exert on current IPR frameworks, highlighting technical obstacles related to verifying ownership, detecting infringement at scale, and computationally evaluating originality. We assert that overcoming these obstacles necessitates more than legal adjustments; it demands fundamentally novel engineering approaches applying AI to the IP system. Consequently, this work introduces an AI-powered engineering framework that integrates specific algorithms and applications: Natural Language Processing techniques like semantic embedding models for text analysis and comparison; Computer Vision algorithms such as perceptual hashing and deep feature extraction for image/video analysis; machine learning classifiers for filtering infringement alerts; and blockchain technology for secure timestamping and registration. This framework seeks to deliver scalable, efficient, and resilient tools for IPR registration, authentication, automated infringement surveillance, and support for originality analysis, thereby promoting technological progress while protecting creator entitlements within the dynamic digital ecosystem.},
